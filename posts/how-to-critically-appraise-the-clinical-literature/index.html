By having standard appraisal instruments, these studies can be appraised more easily for completeness, bias, and applicability for implementation. Appraisal requires a different set of instruments, each designed for the individual type of research. We also hope that this article can be used in academic programs to educate the faculty and trainees of the available resources to improve critical appraisal of health research.</p><p>This article is the second in a series of two articles that review how to report and how to critically appraise research in health care. The first article reviewed the reporting of and the available guidelines on how to report health research. In this article, critical appraisal of screening studies and diagnostic test accuracy studies, therapeutic studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness studies, recommendations and/or guidelines, and medical education studies is discussed as are the available instruments to appraise literature.</p><p>Recent efforts have been made to standardize both the reporting and the appraisal of clinical health research including clinical guidelines. Many of the presentations at the joint Radiological Alliance for Health Service Research/Alliance of Clinical-Educators in Radiology session at the 2013 Association of University Radiologists annual meeting highlighted appraisal instruments available. By having standard formats for reporting research findings and guidelines, these studies can be appraised more easily for completeness, bias, and applicability for implementation. Appraisal requires a different set of instruments, each designed for the individual type of research. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) was initially published in 2003 and has been used to evaluate the quality of diagnostic accuracy studies . Recent revisions produced QUADAS-2 . Similarly, the Assessment of Multiple Systemic Reviews (AMSTAR) was published in 2007 and uses 11 yes or no questions to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews . The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument evaluates the process of practice guideline development and the quality of reporting .</p><h2 id="how-to-appraise-literature"><span class="mr-2">How to appraise literature</span><a href="#how-to-appraise-literature" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><h2 id="screening-studies-and-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies"><span class="mr-2">Screening Studies and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies</span><a href="#screening-studies-and-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There is no specific Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research network (EQUATOR) or other recommendations for appraising screening studies.
