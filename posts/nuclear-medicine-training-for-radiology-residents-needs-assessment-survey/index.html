The survey was distributed to 305 chief radiology residents by the SNM Young Professionals Committee and the SNM Program Directors Association in conjunction with the Association of University Radiologists and the Association of Program Directors in Radiology. The survey was placed on the Web at http://www.surveymonkey.com and distributed via e-mail. The chief residents were encouraged to ask other residents in their respective programs to also participate in the survey. Responses were accepted between August 2005 and November 2005. Residents were asked to rate the quality and quantity of their clinical, didactic, and nuclear medicine physics training. Residents were also asked if they had enough training/experience to perform various nuclear medicine tasks including: performing therapies and interpreting PET/CT, nuclear cardiology, and general nuclear medicine studies. Last, they were asked about their preferred formats for educational materials including: didactic lectures in CD-ROM format, a Web-based case lecture series or modules, and nuclear medicine board review courses. Data were analyzed on a percentage basis for all respondents and for some questions for the subset of fourth-year radiology residents.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Survey Questions</p><p>1.

The absolute response rate was not calculated because chief residents were encouraged to forward the survey to other residents in their respective programs and it was not possible to determine the total number of possible respondents. Respondents may have included both chief residents and non–chief residents. Sixteen of the respondents were first-year residents, 19 were second years, 49 were third years, and 67 were fourth years. At the time of the survey, 5% had no training in nuclear medicine, 23% had 0–2 months, 47% had 2–4 months, and 25% had 4–6 months ( Table 2 ). Eighty-six percent of residents ( <em>n</em> = 143) said that they received between 50% and 100% of their training via their clinical rotations. Didactic lectures and self-study accounted for the second largest component of training. Call accounted for the smallest component of training, with 100% of residents stating that call comprised only 0% to 24% of their training. Only 8% of residents were considering a fellowship in nuclear medicine ( <em>n</em> = 149). Seventy-two percent of respondents planned to read nuclear medicine in their future practices ( <em>n</em> = 150), and 81% planned to read PET/CT ( <em>n</em> = 150).</p><p>Table 2</p><p>Previous Radiology and Nuclear Medicine Training</p><p><em>n</em> (%) Year of training First year 16 (11%) Second year 19 (13%) Third year 49 (32%) Fourth year 67 (44%)</p><p><em>n</em> (%) Months of nuclear medicine training None 7 (5%) 0–2 35 (23%) 2–4 71 (47%) 4–6 38 (25%)</p><p>Residents were asked to rate the amount or quality of their clinical, didactic, and nuclear medicine physics training on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best quality training or adequate months of training). Seventy-seven percent gave their clinical training and 61% gave their amount of clinical training a score of 4 or 5 ( <em>n</em> = 139 and 140, respectively). Fifty-four percent gave the quality of their didactic training one of the two highest scores ( <em>n</em> = 145). Thirty-nine percent of residents rated the amount of nuclear medicine physics training with one of the two highest scores, and 36% rated the quality of nuclear medicine physics training with either a 4 or 5 ( <em>n</em> = 137 and 138, respectively). Of fourth-year radiology residents, 33% felt they had enough experience to perform nuclear medicine therapies ( <em>n</em> = 67), 74% felt they had enough training to read PET/CT ( <em>n</em> = 66), 66% felt they had enough training to read nuclear cardiology studies ( <em>n</em> = 64), and 91% felt prepared to interpret general nuclear medicine studies ( <em>n</em> = 67) ( Table 3 ). Residents were asked to comment on the change in the new minimum requirement in nuclear medicine training from 6 months to 4 months. Eighty-one percent of residents thought that 4 months as opposed to 6 months was adequate or more than enough nuclear medicine training ( <em>n</em> = 149).</p><p>Table 3</p><p>Fourth-Year Residents Perceptions of Preparedness</p><p><em>n</em> (%) I feel prepared to: Perform nuclear medicine therapies 22/67 (33%) Interpret PET and PET/CT studies 49/66 (74%) Interpret general nuclear medicine studies 61/67 (91%) Interpret nuclear cardiology studies 42/64 (66%)</p><p>PET: positron emission tomography; CT: computed tomography.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="discussion"><span class="mr-2">Discussion</span><a href="#discussion" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="references"><span class="mr-2">References</span><a href="#references" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><ul><li><p>1.
