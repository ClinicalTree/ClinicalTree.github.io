This article describes the history and evolution of medical professionalism, with an emphasis on professionalism within radiology. The article identifies the tenets of key professional stakeholders, identifying current expectations for professionalism, and concluding with a summary of practical implications for promoting a shared understanding of professionalism that could inform efforts to teach and assess professionalism in radiology.</p><p>In Western medicine, the original professions of medicine, law, and the clergy first arose in medieval European universities . These professions addressed a class of problems for the society and as a result were granted monopoly status. Laws prohibited nonmembers of professions from practicing; granted authority to the professions to decide who enters training, and how training was organized, conducted, and evaluated; and allowed the profession to negotiate with governmental agencies in monitoring practice. Together these three elements comprise the implied “social contract.” In return for the society conceding autonomy and self-regulation to the professions, the professions were trusted to be altruistic, by not competing unfairly, and always placing primacy on clients, patients, laypersons, and public interests above their own.</p><p>In the United States, the moral courage and leadership of medicine in articulating altruistic standards for promoting population health transformed its public perception from “less a profession than a trade of practitioners who worked with their hands after being trained under an apprentice system [with] … little professional consciousness and … only a limited concept of professional ethics or responsibilities” . When the American Medical Association (AMA) was established in the United States in 1847, it declared its primary task as raising ethical standards in the medical field . The AMA code of ethics was influenced by the code of professional ethics defined by the British historian Thomas Percival in the early-19th century . Percival maintained that physicians occupied a position of public trust, and therefore had obligations to the society that transcended those of workers in other trades. Percival advocated a public-goods approach to medicine, arguing that the public trust it inspires sets it apart from all other fields. In 1858, the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs was created to write and implement an ethics code for American medical professionals, and in 1876 the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) was founded to reform medical education. The AMA played an influential role during this time in establishing standards for medical schools, medical boards, hospital internship programs, medical specialty training, and other areas of health care.</p><p>The AMA also began a process to evaluate medical schools. In 1910, Abraham Flexner, working for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, published the Flexner Report, assessing the quality of education in allopathic medical schools in the United States . The Flexner Report advocated for an alliance between medical schools and state regulators, with the aim of creating a cohesive regulatory body that would address the needs of the public through intentional reforms in the medical education system. As a result, nearly half of 168 medical schools in the United States either closed or merged due to a “bad grade.” Flexner recognized that physicians are “social instruments” whose training comes at great cost to the state and thus requires them to function in a “social and preventive” role. These changes ushered in the first wave of “medical professionalism” and charged medical schools with educating young physicians in these norms.</p><p>In 1942, the AMA established the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to maintain standards for undergraduate medical programs and to accredit medical schools in the United States and Canada . In 1972, key organizations in medicine and medical education (AMA, the American Board of Medical Specialties, the American Hospital Association, the AAMC, and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies) came together to create the Coordinating Council on Medical Education. Their role was to approve and coordinate all areas of medical education, and to this end they created the Liaison Committee for Graduate Medical Education (LCGME) to coordinate and oversee review activities of the several independent residency review committees in existence. In 1981, the LCGME was restructured under new bylaws and renamed the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) . Between 2000 and 2002, the ACGME identified and endorsed six general competencies to assess resident competence; the American Board of Medical Specialties endorsed the same competencies for continuing assessment of competence in practicing physicians. These competencies include patient care, medical knowledge, communication, system-based practice, practice-based learning and improvement, and professionalism.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="why-promote-and-teach-professionalism-in-medicine-and-radiology"><span class="mr-2">Why Promote and Teach Professionalism in Medicine and Radiology?</span><a href="#why-promote-and-teach-professionalism-in-medicine-and-radiology" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p>Table 1</p><p>The 10 Commitments of Professionalism with Examples of Each</p><p>Commitment Examples Professional competence Board certification with ABR, staying up-to-date with CME and MOC, doing SAMs, working in a certified radiology practice, participating in peer review Honesty with patients Being truthful at all times Patient confidentiality Not discussing patient information with friends or family or in public areas Maintaining appropriate relations with patients Having no personal relationships with patients Improving quality of care Participating in departmental quality improvement efforts, including peer review Improving access to care Not denying imaging to patients based on factors other than medical indication Just distribution of finite resources Scanning only the patients who really need the test, when they need it Scientific knowledge Lifelong learning, using evidence-based imaging principles, keeping up-to-date with literature, attending CME courses, doing SAMs Maintaining trust by managing conflicts of interest Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest, not interpreting your family or relatives’ imaging Professional responsibility Getting clinical and prior imaging information, protocoling study to best answer clinical question, supervising study, systematic reviewing of images, structured reporting, prompt reporting of studies, communicating urgent/unexpected/significant findings to referring physician</p><p>ABR, American Board of Radiology;
