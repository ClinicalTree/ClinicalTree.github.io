It is so easy to impress students with books that they have not read, with terms that they have not heard, with situations with which they are unfamiliar.

How can we uphold and promote it? How can it be taught, or at least learned? These are complicated questions. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) states that physicians in residency and fellowship programs should demonstrate “a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles, and sensitivity to diverse patient populations .” But what professional responsibilities are physicians expected to carry out, what ethical principles should they adhere to, what exactly does it mean to be sensitive, and in what respects are patient populations diverse?</p><p>If educational discussions around professionalism are to make a difference, they need to be both practical and specific. We should avoid spending the bulk of our time attempting to define professionalism and instead devote a substantial portion of attention to real-life situations where physicians face important choices in this domain. Such case discussions are often both more engaging and more illuminating than discussions of abstract principles, in part because they invite participants to search within themselves and work together in defining their own professional expectations and ideals. Telling and memorization work less well than asking and discussing.</p><p>To begin with, we need to discard some superficial notions about professionalism. It does not pertain primarily to dress or grooming. It is not about chewing gum or wearing an identification badge within 12 inches of eye level. Professionalism is not a costume. Moreover, professionalism does not consist primarily of a list of “Thou shalt not’s.” We do not admire physicians’ professionalism because they do not lie, cheat, and steal, or even because they refrain from dealing with patients and colleagues in a disrespectful manner. There is no list of unprofessional behaviors that we can distribute to learners and rest assured that they will always conduct themselves professionally.</p><p>Instead of merely enumerating types of unprofessional conduct, we need to work to define the qualities that characterize consummate professionals. Our goal is not merely to raise the floor, so that no one falls below minimal standards of professionalism. It is also to raise the ceiling, so that everyone can perform at their highest level. To do this, we need to focus less on behavior and more on identity and aspirations. What really matters most in this sphere is not the institutional policies, procedures, and rules we follow, but who we are and what we stand for, the attitudes we exhibit every day. Real professionalism is not impressed on us from outside, but something that springs from within.</p><p>Toward this end, we present here seven case descriptions provided by diagnostic radiology residents and introduced at the 2012 AUR annual meeting, each followed by a brief discussion of the salient issues elucidated in discussions involving residents, faculty members, and program directors. Knowing that such cases are real-life accounts provided by peers helps to elicit a high level of resident engagement and enthusiasm for such discussions, which can become quite animated. This is especially important, because presentations on professionalism can sometimes seem as dry as dust. One thing about teaching professionalism is certain: boring learners is a recipe for failure.</p><h2 id="avoiding-conflict"><span class="mr-2">Avoiding conflict</span><a href="#avoiding-conflict" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><blockquote><p>A postoperative abdominal ultrasound examination demonstrates a critical vascular stenosis.
