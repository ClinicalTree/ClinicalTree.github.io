We will also go through some case studies and examine what lies in store for radiology.</p><p>The benefits of an interactive online world are obvious to anyone who can book an airline ticket on a cell phone or call a friend by pressing a button on a car steering wheel. Despite our rapid adaptation of technology, patients still have to call doctors’ offices for appointments, call for imaging appointments, and use regular mail for correspondence between insurance companies and physicians. Even lack of online access to patient histories and other privacy concerns feel antiquated when contrasted with the success of online banking and finance.</p><p>Partially because of the belief that the health care information technology (HIT) industry was lagging behind the rest of the information technology (IT) sector, the federal government started looking at ways to stimulate both the development and implementation of HIT within the United States. The focus was on obtaining pieces of information that would not only be helpful for the individual physician in his or her practice, but also over time serve as a resource to better determine distribution of government funds and assets. An example of this would be to use data pooled from hospitals across the country to help determine how best to distribute vaccines across the country. Some other potential benefits of HIT include patient portals, better communication among consulting physicians, a more streamlined billing process, and a much improved scheduling workflow. It was this future vision for HIT in America that paved the way for meaningful use (MU) legislation.</p><p>MU is overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. Two agencies, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC), and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), work under the department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop and implement MU measures and criteria. The CMS works with physicians and attestation, whereas the ONC works with vendors and develops guidance for them to follow. The ONC, along with the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) also developed ways to test products for MU certification. Third-party, private ONC-approved testing and certification bodies were then created to apply these tests. A vendor applies for MU certification to the approved testing and certification body, whereas a physician applies for certification to the CMS.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, MU funds were allocated in the stimulus bill as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 before passage of the health care reform bill in 2010. Therefore, the program will not be affected by a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care act of 2010 (ie, The Healthcare Reform Bill) .</p><p>MU is divided into an eligible hospital (EH) program and an eligible professional (EP) program. There is also a separate Medicaid version. This article tackles MU from an eligible professional standpoint through Medicare, because that is what most radiologists will qualify for.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="who-is-eligible"><span class="mr-2">Who is eligible?</span><a href="#who-is-eligible" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="payment-and-penalties-schedule"><span class="mr-2">Payment and penalties schedule</span><a href="#payment-and-penalties-schedule" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MeaningfulUse/0_1s20S1076633211005575.jpg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MeaningfulUse/0_1s20S1076633211005575.jpg" alt="Chart 1, Payment Schedule." class="lazyload" data-proofer-ignore></a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="meaningful-use-measures"><span class="mr-2">Meaningful use measures</span><a href="#meaningful-use-measures" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="fifteen-core-objectives"><span class="mr-2">Fifteen Core Objectives</span><a href="#fifteen-core-objectives" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p>Table 1</p><p>Core Set at a Glance: A Summary of the Features of Core Set with a Suggestion for Potential Ease of Adoption by Radiologists</p><p>Core Measures Ease of Adoption by RIS as a Certified EHR Module Clinician physician order entry for medication orders Probably excluded Generate and transmit E-prescriptions Probably excluded Record vital signs, height, weight, blood pressure.
