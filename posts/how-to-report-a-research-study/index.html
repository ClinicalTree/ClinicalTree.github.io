We also hope that this article can be used in academic programs to educate the faculty and trainees of the available resources to improve our health research.</p><p>This article is the first in a series of two articles that will review how to report and how to critically appraise research in health care. In this article, the reporting of diagnostic test accuracy and screening studies, therapeutic studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, cost-effectiveness studies, recommendations and/or guidelines, and medical education studies is discussed. The available guidelines on how to report these different types of health research are also discussed. The second article will review the evolution of standardization of critical appraisal techniques for health research.</p><p>Recent efforts have been made to standardize both the reporting and the critical appraisal of clinical health research including clinical guidelines. In 2006, Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) network was formed to improve the quality of reporting health research . Recognizing the need to critically assess the methodological quality of studies and the wide spread deficiencies and lack of standardization in primary research reporting, the network brought together international stakeholders including editors, peer reviewers, and developers of guidelines to improve both the quality of research publications and the quality of the research itself . Many of the presentations at the joint Radiological Alliance for Health Service Research/Alliance of Clinical-Educators in Radiology session at the 2013 Association of University Radiologists annual meeting highlighted reporting guidelines available at the EQUATOR network . The EQUATOR network goals are raising awareness of the crucial importance of accurate and complete reporting of research; becoming the recognized global center providing resources, education, and training relating to the reporting of health research and use of reporting guidelines; assisting in the development, dissemination, and implementation of reporting guidelines; monitoring the status of the quality of reporting across health research literature; and conducting research evaluating or pertaining to the quality of reporting . The desired result of these goals is to improve the quality of health care research reporting which subsequently improves patient care.</p><p>The EQUATOR Network Resource Centre provides up-to-date resources related to health research reporting mainly for authors of research articles; journal editors and peer reviewers; and reporting guideline developers to enable better reporting, reviewing, and editing. Within the library for health research reporting, the EQUATOR network has developed and maintains a digital library that provides publications related to writing research articles; reporting guidelines and guidance on scientific writing; the use of reporting guidelines in editorial and peer review processes; the development of reporting guidelines; and evaluations of the quality of reporting. The library contains comprehensive lists of the available reporting guidelines, listed by study type. These include experimental studies, observational studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, biospecimen reporting, reliability and agreement studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, qualitative research, mixed-methods studies, economic evaluations, and quality improvement studies. The network has developed several standards for reporting research including the consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) checklist and flow diagram for randomized control trials (RCTs) ; the transparent reporting of evaluations with nonrandomized designs (TREND) checklist for nonrandomized trials; the standards for the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies (STARD) checklist and flow diagram for diagnostic test accuracy studies ; the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists for cohort, case–control, and cross-sectional studies; the preferred reporting items of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist and flow diagram for systematic reviews and meta-analyses ; the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) and enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research (ENTREQ) checklists for reporting qualitative research; standards for quality improvement reporting excellence (SQUIRE) checklist for quality improvement studies; consolidated health economic evaluation reporting standards (CHEERS) for health economics studies ; and statement on reporting of evaluation studies in health informatics (STARE-HI) for studies of health informatics.</p><h2 id="how-to-report-studies"><span class="mr-2">How to report studies</span><a href="#how-to-report-studies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><h2 id="screening-studies-and-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies"><span class="mr-2">Screening Studies and Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies</span><a href="#screening-studies-and-diagnostic-test-accuracy-studies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There are no specific EQUATOR network recommendations for reporting screening studies. However, in general, reporting screening studies should incorporate the items important to diagnostic test accuracy studies. Screening is the application of a test to detect a disease in an individual who has no known signs or symptoms. The purpose of screening is to prevent or delay the development of advanced disease through earlier detection and enable treatment of disease that is both less morbid and more effective.</p><p>Screening is distinct from other diagnostic tests in that patients undergoing screening are asymptomatic, and the chance of having the disease of interest is lower in asymptomatic patients compared to those presenting with symptoms. For a screening study, the most important factors to consider are the characteristics of the population to be screened, the screening regimens being compared, the diagnostic test performance of the screening test or tests, and the outcome measure selected. Additional considerations are the diagnostic consequences which occur during a patient’s screening episode, such as additional downstream testing for those with positive test results and follow-up monitoring of those with negative test results.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p>Table 1</p><p>STARD Items and Explanation</p><p>Item Title/Abstract/Key words 1 Identify the article as a study of diagnostic accuracy Use the term “diagnostic accuracy” in the title or abstract.</p><p>In 1991, the National Library of Medicine’s MEDLINE database introduced a specific keyword (MeSH heading) for diagnostic studies: “Sensitivity and Specificity.” Introduction 2 State the research questions or study aims, such as estimating diagnostic accuracy or comparing accuracy between tests or across participant groups. Describe the scientific background, previous work on the subject, the remaining uncertainty, and, hence, the rationale for their study.</p><p>Clearly specified research questions help the readers to judge the appropriateness of the study design and data analysis. Methods <em>Participants</em> 3 Describe the study population: The inclusion and exclusion criteria, setting and locations where data were collected. Diagnostic accuracy studies describe the behavior of a test under particular circumstances and should report its inclusion and exclusion criteria for selecting the study population. The spectrum of the target disease can vary and affect test performance. 4 Describe participant recruitment and sampling: How eligible patients are identified. Was recruitment based on presenting symptoms, results from previous tests, or the fact that the participants had received the index tests or the reference standard?</p><p>Describe how eligible subjects were identified and whether the study enrolls consecutive or random sampling of patients. Study designs are likely to influence the spectrum of disease represented. 5 Describe participant sampling: Was the study population a consecutive series of participants defined by the selection criteria in item 3 and 4? If not, specify how participants were further selected. 6 Describe data collection: Was data collection planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study)? Prospective data collection has many advantages: better data control, additional checks for data integrity and consistency, and a level of clinical detail appropriate to the problem. As a result, there will be fewer missing or uninterpretable data items.</p><p>Retrospective data collection starts after patients have undergone the index test and the reference standard and often relies on chart review. Studies with retrospective data collection may reflect routine clinical practice better than a prospective study, but also may fail to identify all eligible patients or to provide data of high quality. Methods <em>Test methods</em> 7 Describe the reference standard and its rationale. The reference standard is used to distinguish patients with and without disease. When it is not possible to subject all patients to the reference standard for practical or ethical reasons, composite reference standard is an alternative. The components may reflect different definitions or strategies for disease diagnosis. 8 Describe technical specifications of material and methods involved including how and when measurements were taken, and/or cite references for index tests and reference standard. Describe the methods involved in the execution of index test and reference standard in sufficient detail to allow other researchers to replicate the study. Differences in the execution of the index test and reference standard are a potential source of variation in diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>The description should cover the full test protocol including the specification of materials and instruments together with their instructions for use. 9 Describe the definitions and rationale for the units, thresholds and/or categories of the index tests and reference standard. Test results can be truly dichotomous (eg, present or absent), have multiple categories or be continuous. Clearly describe how and when category boundaries are used. 10 Describe the number, training, and expertise of the persons executing and reading the index tests and the reference standard. Variability in the manipulation, processing, or reading of the index test or reference standard will affect diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>Professional background, expertise, and prior training to improve interpretation and to reduce interobserver variation all affect the quality of reading. 11 Describe whether or not the readers of the index tests and reference standard were blind (masked) to the results of the other test and describe any other clinical information available to the readers. Knowledge of the results of the reference standard can influence the reading of the index test, and vice versa, leading to inflated measures of diagnostic accuracy. Methods <em>Statistical methods</em> 12 Describe methods for calculating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy, and the statistical methods used to quantify uncertainty (eg, 95% confidence intervals). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, ROC, likelihood ratio and odds ratio. 13 Describe methods for calculating test reproducibility, if done. Reproducibility of the index test and reference standard varies. Poor reproducibility adversely affects diagnostic accuracy. If possible, authors should evaluate the reproducibility of the test methods used in their study and report their procedure to do so. Results <em>Participants</em> 14 Report when study was performed, including beginning and end dates of recruitment. Technology behind many tests advances continuously, leading to improvements in diagnostic accuracy. There may be a considerable gap between the dates of the study and the publication date of the study report. 15 Report Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population. Description of the demographic and clinical characteristics are usually presented in a table, such as age, sex, spectrum of presenting symptoms, comorbidity, current treatments, recruitment centers. 16 Report the number of participants satisfying the criteria for inclusion who did or did not undergo the index tests and/or the reference standard. Describe why participants failed to receive either test.</p><p>Flow diagram is strongly recommended. Results <em>Test results</em> 17 Report time interval between the index tests and the reference standard, and any treatment administered in between. When delay occurs between doing the index test and the reference standard the condition of the patient may change, leading to worsening or improvement of the disease. Similar concerns apply if treatment is started after doing the index test but before doing the reference standard. 18 Report distribution of severity of disease (define criteria). Demographic and clinical features of the study population can affect measures of diagnostic accuracy. Many diseases are not pure dichotomous states but cover a continuum, ranging from minute pathological changes to advanced clinical disease. Test sensitivity is often higher in studies with a higher proportion of patients with more advanced stages of the target condition. 19 Report a cross tabulation of the results of the index tests (including indeterminate and missing results) by the results of the reference standard; for continuous results, the distribution of the test results by the results of the reference standard. Cross tabulations of test results in categories and graphs of distributions of continuous results are essential to allow scientific colleagues to (re)calculate measures of diagnostic accuracy or to perform alternative analyses, including meta-analysis. 20 Report any adverse events from performing the index tests or the reference standard. Not all tests are safe. Measuring and reporting of adverse events in studies of diagnostic accuracy can provide additional information about the clinical usefulness of a particular test. Results <em>Estimates</em> 21 Report estimates of diagnostic accuracy and measures of statistical uncertainty (eg, 95% confidence intervals). Report a value of how well the test results correspond with the reference standard. The values presented in the report should be taken as estimates with some variation. Many journals require or strongly encourage the use of confidence intervals as measures of precision. A 95% confidence interval is conventional. 22 Report how indeterminate results, missing data and outliers of the index tests were handled. Uninterpretable, indeterminate, and intermediate test results pose a problem in the assessment of a diagnostic test. By itself, the frequency of these test results is an important indicator of the overall usefulness of the test. Furthermore, ignoring such test results can produce biased estimates of diagnostic accuracy if these results occur more frequently in patients with disease than in those without, or vice versa. 23 Report estimates of variability of diagnostic accuracy between subgroups of participants, readers or centers, if done. Since variability is the rule rather than the exception, researchers should explore possible sources of heterogeneity in results, within the limits of the available sample size. The best practice is to plan subgroup analyses before the start of the study. 24 Report estimates of test reproducibility, if done. Report all measures of test reproducibility performed during the study. For quantitative analytical methods, report the coefficient of variation (CV). Discussion 25 Discuss the clinical applicability of the study findings. Provide a general interpretation of the results in the context of current evidence and its applicability in practice.</p><p>Clearly define the methodological shortcomings of the study, how it potentially affected the results and approaches to limit its significance.</p><p>Discuss differences between the context of the study and other settings and patient groups in which the test is likely to be used.</p><p>Provide future direction for this work in advancing clinical practice or research in this field.</p><p>NPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value; ROC, receiver

Trial Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (ISPOR RCT-CEA) Task Force Report of Core Recommendations for Conducting Economic Analyses Alongside Clinical Trials</p><p><strong>Trial design</strong> 1 Trial design should reflect effectiveness rather than efficacy when possible. 2 Full follow-up of all patients is encouraged. 3 Describe power and ability to test hypotheses, given the trial sample size. 4 Clinical end points used in economic evaluations should be disaggregated. 5 Direct measures of outcome are preferred to use of intermediate end points.<strong>Data elements</strong> 6 Obtain information to derive health state utilities directly from the study population. 7 Collect all resources that may substantially influence overall costs; these include those related and unrelated to the intervention.<strong>Database design and management</strong> 8 Collection and management of the economic data should be fully integrated into the clinical data. 9 Consent forms should include wording permitting the collection of economic data, particularly when it will be gathered from third-party databases and may include pre- and/or post-trial records.<strong>Analysis</strong> 10 The analysis of economic measures should be guided by a data analysis plan and hypotheses that are drafted prior to the onset of the study. 11 All cost-effectiveness analyses should include the following: an intention-to-treat analysis; common time horizon(s) for accumulating costs and outcomes; a within-trial assessment of costs and outcomes; an assessment of uncertainty; a common discount rate applied to future costs and outcomes; an accounting for missing and/or censored data. 12 Incremental costs and outcomes should be measured as differences in arithmetic means, with statistical testing accounting for issues specific to these data (eg, skewness, mass at zero, censoring, construction of QALYs). 13 Imputation is desirable if there is a substantial amount of missing data. Censoring, if present, should also be addressed. 14 One or more summary measures should be used to characterize the relative value of the intervention. 15 Examples include ratio measures, difference measures, and probability measures (eg, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves). 16 Uncertainty should be characterized. Account for uncertainty that stems from sampling, fixed parameters such as unit costs and the discount rate, and methods to address missing data. 17 Threats to external validity—including protocol-driven resource use, unrepresentative recruiting centers, restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria, and artificially enhanced compliance—are best addressed at the design phase. 18 Multinational trials require special consideration to address intercountry differences in population characteristics and treatment patterns. 19 When models are used to estimate costs and outcomes beyond the time horizon of the trial, good modeling practices should be followed.</p><p>Models should reflect the expected duration of the intervention on costs and outcomes. 20 Subgroup analyses based on prespecified clinical and economic interactions, when found to be significant ex post, are appropriate. Ad hoc subgroup analysis is discouraged.<strong>Reporting the results</strong> 21 Minimum reporting standards for cost-effectiveness analyses should be adhered to for those conducted alongside clinical trials. 22 The cost-effectiveness report should include a general description of the clinical trial and key clinical findings. 23 Reporting should distinguish economic data collected as part of the trial vs. data not collected as part of the trial. 24 The amount of missing data should be reported. If imputation methods are used, the method should be described. 25 Methods used to construct and compare costs and outcomes, and to project costs and outcomes beyond the trial period should be described. 26 The results section should include summaries of resource use, costs, and outcome measures, including point estimates and measures of uncertainty. Results should be reported for the time horizon of the trial, and for projections beyond the trial (if conducted). 27 Graphical displays are recommended for results not easily reported in tabular form (eg, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, joint density of incremental costs and outcomes).</p><p>QALYs, quality-adjusted life years.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="recommendations-andor-guidelines"><span class="mr-2">Recommendations and/or Guidelines</span><a href="#recommendations-andor-guidelines" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><blockquote><p>Practice guidelines are systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p>Table 4</p><p>Standards for Developing Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines</p><p>Standard 1 Establishing transparency Standard 2 Management of conflict of interest Standard 3 Guideline development group composition Standard 4 Clinical practice guideline-systematic review intersection Standard 5 Establishing evidence foundations for and rating strength of recommendations Standard 6 Articulations of recommendations Standard 7 External review Standard 8 Updating</p><p>Based on clinical practice guidelines we can trust, Institute of Medicine, National Academic Press, 2011 (64).</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="medical-education-studies"><span class="mr-2">Medical Education Studies</span><a href="#medical-education-studies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><h2 id="conclusions"><span class="mr-2">Conclusions</span><a href="#conclusions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p>Table 5</p><p>Reporting Guidelines by Research Study Design, Acronym, Web site URL, and Bibliographic Reference</p><p>Research Study Design Reporting Guidelines Provided For Reporting Guideline Acronym Reporting Guideline Web Site URL Full Text if Available Full Bibliographic Reference Diagnostic test accuracy Studies of diagnostic accuracy STARD http://www.stard-statement.org/ Full-text PDF documents of the STARD Statement, checklist, flow diagram and the explanation and elaboration document Bossuyt PM, Reitsma JB, Bruns DE, Gatsonis CA, Glasziou PP, Irwig LM, Lijmer JG, Moher D, Rennie D, de Vet HC.

Introduction 2 State the research questions or study aims, such as estimating diagnostic accuracy or comparing accuracy between tests or across participant groups. Methods Participants 3 The study population: The inclusion and exclusion criteria, setting and locations where data were collected. 4 Participant recruitment: Was recruitment based on presenting symptoms, results from previous tests, or the fact that the participants had received the index tests or the reference standard? 5 Participant sampling: Was the study population a consecutive series of participants defined by the selection criteria in item 3 and 4? If not, specify how participants were further selected. 6 Data collection: Was data collection planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study)? Test methods 7 The reference standard and its rationale. 8 Technical specifications of material and methods involved including how and when measurements were taken, and/or cite references for index tests and reference standard. 9 Definition of and rationale for the units, cut-offs and/or categories of the results of the index tests and the reference standard. 10 The number, training and expertise of the persons executing and reading the index tests and the reference standard. 11 Whether or not the readers of the index tests and reference standard were blind (masked) to the results of the other test and describe any other clinical information available to the readers. Statistical methods 12 Methods for calculating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy, and the statistical methods used to quantify uncertainty (e.g. 95% confidence intervals). 13 Methods for calculating test reproducibility, if done. Results Participants 14 When study was performed, including beginning and end dates of recruitment. 15 Clinical and demographic characteristics of the study population (at least information on age, gender, spectrum of presenting symptoms). 16 The number of participants satisfying the criteria for inclusion who did or did not undergo the index tests and/or the reference standard; describe why participants failed to undergo either test (a flow diagram is strongly recommended). Test results 17 Time-interval between the index tests and the reference standard, and any treatment administered in between. 18 Distribution of severity of disease (define criteria) in those with the target condition; other diagnoses in participants without the target condition. 19 A cross tabulation of the results of the index tests (including indeterminate and missing results) by the results of the reference standard; for continuous results, the distribution of the test results by the results of the reference standard. 20 Any adverse events from performing the index tests or the reference standard.
