Hurricane Katrina damaged the department’s facilities, severely decreased departmental cash flow, disrupted resident education, and resulted in faculty exodus.

All institutions face the possibility of a natural disaster. It is imperative to have a plan in place to ensure continued resident education, patient safety, and ACGME accreditation.</p><p>Hurricane Katrina, one of the most deadly and most expensive hurricanes ever to hit the United States, made landfall slightly east of New Orleans early on Monday, August 29, 2005. The storm and its surge breached more than 50 canal levees, causing 80% of the city of New Orleans to become flooded by Wednesday, some areas with up to 15 feet of water. More than 90% of the city’s residents were forced to evacuate. The impact of Hurricane Katrina was far reaching and extended beyond the parish boundaries. It is estimated that complete recovery will cost billions of dollars and take many more years. This case study documents the impact of Katrina on the Department of Radiology at the Louisiana State University (LSU) School of Medicine in New Orleans.</p><p>Before Katrina, LSU radiology had a large, successful residency program with dedicated faculty members, modernized facilities, and strong finances. The radiology program had a complement of approximately 30 residents, along with clinical fellows in programs approved by the Diagnostic Radiology Residency Review Committee (RRC) in neuroradiology, vascular and interventional radiology, and musculoskeletal radiology. LSU radiology’s primary practice site was at the Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans (MCLNO), one of several hospitals within the LSU public hospital network (LSU Health Care Services Division [HCSD]). MCLNO was composed of two campuses, Charity Hospital and University Hospital, located within 1 mile of each other. The department also provided services at Kenner Regional Medical Center and some imaging services at the New Orleans Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Residents rotated through these other hospitals, as well as New Orleans Children’s Hospital. Faculty members included approximately 28 full-time clinical radiologists (not including one faculty member appointed to the dean’s staff who remained clinically active), along with two full-time research faculty members and one full-time and one part-time physicist. The LSU Diagnostic Radiology Residency Program was granted a 5-year review cycle on the basis of an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) site visit on April 4, 2003, and routinely produced satisfied, successful residents who pursued both academic and community practice opportunities.</p><h2 id="katrinas-impact-on-lsu-radiology"><span class="mr-2">Katrina’s impact on LSU radiology</span><a href="#katrinas-impact-on-lsu-radiology" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>In the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina, some senior residents volunteered to take a code gray call, believing that this hurricane would be no different from those that had recently preceded it. Volunteering for a code gray call was considered a privilege, because residents who served a 24- to 48-hour code gray call were those considered the most versatile and capable (and they were also entitled to time off in the coming days to sort out whatever aftereffects of the storm might be left behind). Tropical storms and hurricanes are a common occurrence along the entire Gulf Coast; most citizens of this area had experienced such weather occurrences in the past, and although evacuation was commonplace for lay citizens, hospital evacuations were not planned for or undertaken. In recent hurricane scares, routine hospital operations had been suspended for 24 to 48 hours during voluntary evacuations of the city proper. However, in the days leading up to landfall, there was widespread concern that Katrina was bigger and potentially more devastating than its recent predecessors; satellite imagery revealed that Katrina filled the entire Gulf of Mexico. As such, neither the hospital nor the department had a formal evacuation plan in place. Essentially all the radiology residents and faculty members not in house for the code gray call appropriately moved to safer locations across the state and region.</p><p>Preparations for the storm also took place on the academic side of the campus operation. Anticipating a several-day interruption in operations, at a minimum, the LSU Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) human resources department made arrangements to run payroll early, and contingency plans were made to relocate essential services at the main LSU campus in Baton Rouge or other state facilities in either Baton Rouge or Shreveport. Faculty and staff members are granted special leave for hurricane disruptions if they are not assigned to work as essential personnel either in a clinical setting or otherwise; Katrina went on to prove its exceptional character, as many of the faculty and staff members remained on special leave formally until November 30, 2005, even if they resumed some academic or clinical activities.</p><h2 id="facilities"><span class="mr-2">Facilities</span><a href="#facilities" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Both MCLNO campuses experienced severe flooding, and as a consequence, both University Hospital and Charity Hospital sustained severe disruptions in critical utilities, including the loss of running water, and the facilities relied on generator power for emergency electrical needs. Immediately after the storm, streets had indeed taken on water, but only up to a level expected after such a storm. However, within about 10 to 12 hours after several levees were breached, the water level rose, flooding the entire basements of both hospitals. The plan was to keep patients two floors above any area that suffered flooding. As such, the first floors of both hospitals were evacuated, with patients being moved to the second floor. There were no injuries to any patients or staff members during the flooding.</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LSUHealthSciencesCenterNewOrleansDepartmentofRadiology/0_1s20S1076633209000506.jpg" class="popup img-link "><img data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LSUHealthSciencesCenterNewOrleansDepartmentofRadiology/0_1s20S1076633209000506.jpg" alt="Figure 1, Timeline for the resumption of clinical services at the Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans (MCLNO).
