The Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) developed a template that outlines important components of an external review report and a table that outlines the objective information that can be requested from the institution/department prior to the reviewer’s site visit. The template is meant to facilitate a high-quality review and serve as a guide to a chair who is preparing for his/her first review, chairs who serve as external consultants, and institutional officials seeking review of a radiology department.</p><h2 id="purpose-of-external-reviews"><span class="mr-2">Purpose of external reviews</span><a href="#purpose-of-external-reviews" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>External reviews are used to evaluate a department on a routine basis or before reappointment or recruitment of a department chair. The goals of such a review are to: (1) document the department’s achievements and progress, (2) assess gaps, opportunities, and strengths as a framework for strategic planning, (3) establish goals and priorities for the future, (4) foster continuous improvement of programs and services, (5) provide feedback to the department regarding its performance and the relationship of that performance with institutional expectations and national benchmarks, (6) educate the institution as to the status, directions, and needs of the department, (7) provide expert advice to both the institution and the department, (8) provide a mechanism by which the members of a department can express their views concerning the competence and responsiveness of the chair (and other department leaders) and confidence in their leadership, and (9) serve as the basis for dialog between the chair, dean, and hospital leadership . Chairs of academic radiology departments are accountable for their department’s performance in meeting the tripartite mission of patient care, education, and research. Depending on the particular institution, a wide variety of stated and unstated expectations exist regarding the performance targets in each of these three domains.</p><p>Many radiology chairs are asked to serve as external consultants to review departments at other medical schools. Participating in external reviews can be viewed by the chair as an important service to the radiology community, a mechanism to provide guidance or mentorship to a fellow leader in radiology, an opportunity for self-development and to compare one’s own department with others, and to learn things that may benefit the reviewer’s department. The Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD) views external reviews as a tool that when optimally used can foster the success of an individual chair and academic department and ultimately contribute to continual process improvement across the field of radiology. SCARD developed a template ( Appendix ) that outlines important components of an external review report and a table ( Table 1 ) that outlines the objective information that can be requested from the institution/department before the reviewer’s site visit. The template is meant to facilitate a high-quality review process by outlining standardized elements based on the best practices. It may further serve as a guide to a chair who is preparing for his/her first review, chairs who serve as external consultants, and institutional officials seeking a review of a radiology department. Although no approach fits all institutional needs, the review process should reflect the unique context and individual circumstances of the institution and the department under review, and the availability of a comprehensive standardized template can be valuable. Objective criteria are critical for measuring a department’s progress and comparing a department’s performance with national benchmarks. These objective metrics should be considered in concert with subjective data to create a report that reflects a department’s strengths and weaknesses and provides specific actionable recommendations for performance improvement. A complete description of the operational aspects of a radiology department and metrics that can be used to judge a department’s performance are beyond the scope of this article and can be found elsewhere . A detailed process for radiology services review is also available from the Royal College of Radiologists in London, England .</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Information to Request Before Radiology Department

href="#review-process" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The “classic” department review typically occurs at regular intervals (usually every 5–7 years), is directed by the medical school dean, and is conducted by both an internal review committee and external advisors who produce a formal report . Internal and external reviewers can work separately or as a combined committee. Some schools of medicine have begun to rethink the traditional departmental review process, citing “too much data and too little plan” . Other criticisms of reviews have included a little long-lasting benefit as perceived by the department and dean’s office, lack of follow up of the report’s recommendations, ineffective strategic planning resulting from the retrospective analysis of the department, and limited incentive by reviewers to document weaknesses, if the review is seen primarily as an opportunity to request additional resources. Additionally, reviews are costly to an institution in terms of actual expense and staff time. The Stanford University School of Medicine estimated the average cost per review to be $20,000 for honoraria, travel, and supplies, and $20,000 for dean’s office staff time; the additional costs of Radiology department faculty and staff time was not calculated . The University of Michigan Medical School estimated the annual cost of conducting reviews to be up to $240,000 . In an effort to gain a greater return on investment, they revised their departmental review process to link strategic goals, performance measures, evaluation systems, and rewards . The final report is a strategic plan containing a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis and strategic goals for the department, with related action plans. The Michigan model employs outside experts from the same as well as from a different medical discipline and from a nonmedical discipline (e.g., strategic planning expert).</p><p>The review of a department should include an assessment of the overall leadership and management performance of the department chair, presence of good faculty development practices, integrity of the teaching programs, excellence of the research program and associated research infrastructure, and quality and effectiveness of the clinical programs . Similarly, there should be a stated understanding of favorable or unfavorable trends in the department, including the evolving nature and structure of the department and its effectiveness over time in addressing the tripartite mission. Although chair job expectations may vary from institution to institution, there is a general agreement on the main areas of accountability. The American Association of Chairs of Departments of Psychiatry established a tool kit for new chairs that included key issues and responsibilities of a chair and benchmarking information on other psychiatry departments nationally .</p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article&lt;</a></p><p><a href="https://clinicalpub.com/app">Get Radiology Tree
