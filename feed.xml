<p>The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging markers in predicting future forced expiratory volume in one second decline/chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder progression in smokers compared to current diagnostic techniques.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>Total 60 subjects (15 nonsmokers and 45 smokers) participated in both baseline and follow-up visits (∼1.4 years apart). At both visits, subjects completed pulmonary function testing, a six-minute walk test , and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire. Using helium-3 MR imaging, means (M) and standard deviations (H) of oxygen tension (P  A O  2 ), fractional ventilation, and apparent diffusion coefficient were calculated across 12 regions of interest in the lungs. Subjects who experienced FEV1 decline &gt;100 mL/year were deemed “decliners,” while those who did not were deemed “sustainers.” Nonimaging and imaging prediction models were generated through a logistic regression model, which utilized measurements from sustainers and decliners.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The nonimaging prediction model included the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire total score, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide by the alveolar volume (DLCO/VA), and distance walked in a six-minute walk test. A receiving operating character curve for this model yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 68% with an overall area under the curve of 65%. The imaging prediction model generated following the same methodology included ADC  H , FV  H , and P  A O  2 H . The resulting receiving operating character curve yielded a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 82.8%, and an area under the curve of 89.7%.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The imaging predication model generated from measurements obtained during  3 He MR imaging is better able to predict future FEV1 decline compared to one based on current clinical tests and demographics. The imaging model’s superiority appears to arise from its ability to distinguish well-circumscribed, severe disease from a more uniform distribution of moderately altered lung function, which is more closely associated with subsequent FEV1 decline.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is a progressive disease of the lungs in which obstructed airflow and destruction of the lung parenchyma cause disrupted and deteriorating lung function often accompanied by sputum production, dyspnea, and cough ( ). In 2015, 3.17 million deaths were attributed to COPD, accounting for nearly 5% of total global deaths ( ). COPD is typically diagnosed by assessing forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV  1 ) together with the presentation of associated symptoms; however, while tracking annual FEV  1 decline has been considered the most effective way to monitor COPD progression since the 1970s ( ), it has proven ineffective for predicting future lung function decline. In recent years, the hyperpolarized noble gases have been developed as MRI contrast agents capable of delivering images of gas distribution throughout all regions of the lung, which can be used to quantify lung function during ventilation and diffusion ( ). As a result, assessing gas distribution and heterogeneity in signal intensity throughout the lung now offers an alternative method for monitoring COPD progression with better prognostic potential. In this paper, we present a model for using  3 He MR imaging markers to predict functional decline in the lungs of smokers with high sensitivity and specificity.</p>

<p>To diagnose symptomatic COPD, physicians utilize GOLD criteria based on the ratio of a patient’s FEV  1 to their forced vital capacity (FVC) after bronchodilator use ( ). After initial diagnosis (FEV  1 /FVC &lt; 70%), disease progression is tracked via changes in percent predicted FEV  1 (%FEV  1 ), and is staged from GOLD 1 (≥80% predicted) to GOLD 4 (&lt;30% predicted). Depending on the annual rate of FEV  1 decline, clinicians can then determine whether a smoker’s lung function is declining rapidly (“decliner”) or at a rate consistent with normal aging (“sustainer”) ( ). However, because spirometric measurements cannot differentiate between decliners and sustainers until after a significant functional decline has already occurred, they represent a much better tool for confirming disease progression than for predicting future functional decline ( ).</p>

<p>Out of body organ perfusion is a concept that has been around for a long time. As technology has evolved, so have the systems available for out of body perfusion making whole organ preservation for extended evaluation, resuscitation, and discovery routine.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>Clinical use of ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) systems has continued to expand as evidence has accumulated to suggest EVLP transplants experience similar mortality, ICU length of stay, length of mechanical ventilation, hospital length of stay, and rates of primary graft dysfunction as conventional lung transplants. In 2017, more lung transplants were performed than any previous year in the US history.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Early success of EVLP has motivated groups to evaluate additional donor types and methods for expanding the donor pool. The ability to keep a lung alive in a physiologically neutral environment opens the ability to better understand organ quality, define pathophysiology in certain disease conditions, and provides a platform for interventions to prevent or repair injury.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The next several years will usher in significant changes in understanding and interventions focused on lung injury. This manuscript highlights applications of EVLP to clarify how this system can be used for basic and translational research.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Lung transplantation is an effective therapy for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, a major challenge facing this therapeutic option is the limited availability of suitable organs for transplantation ( ). As a consequence of this limitation, strategies have been employed to increase the number of lung transplants by expanding the donor pool through improved donor management strategies, use of extended criteria donors and ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) technologies ( ). As experience in lung transplantation with EVLP has continued to expand, further interest in use of this technology for use in other contexts has become increasingly common. Our group has utilized this technology to create a high-fidelity human lung model for basic and translational work in drug discovery pipelines, toxicant research, and molecular characterization of acute lung injury. For the purposes of this manuscript, we will describe the closed atrium acellular method of EVLP to highlight clinical and research applications of out-of-body perfusion. Our intent is to provide a basic understanding of out of body perfusion in order to facilitate basic and translational research efforts that capitalize from clinical experience and expand the multidisciplinary potential of this technology.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-out-of-body-lung-perfusion">History of out of body lung perfusion</h2>

<p>The first experimental lung transplant was performed by Vladamir Demikhov in 1947. Almost 20 years passed before the first human technical success was reported by James Hardy and almost 40 years before the first clinical success reported by Joel Cooper in 1983. Significant progress had been made in lung transplant, but there are still too few organs for transplant. This reinvigorated interest in out of body perfusion techniques proposed by Lindbergh and Carrel in the 1930s ( ). The concept of out of body whole organ perfusion for organ evaluation had been previously described by the French physiologist Le Gallois in 1812 but was not successfully realized until Lindbergh and Carrel in 1935. Their success was in part due to surgical innovation to allow for organ procurement without organ damage, improved aseptic techniques and the development of an apparatus that could be sterilized and perfuse an organ indefinitely ( ). Though successful, this technique for whole organ perfusion was not used clinically and remained a relatively infrequently used research technique. With increasing numbers of patients waiting for transplant and limited numbers of suitable donor available for transplant, efforts were made to identify new methods for expanding the donor pool. A promising solution for this organ shortage was to use organs from nonbrain dead donors whom had elected to have a natural death and donate their organs to help other patients in need. Donation after cardiac death donors present unique challenges since the assessment of such donors can be significantly limited. To overcome these limitations, Stig Steen, used a low potassium dextran augmented blood-based perfusate and a modified perfusions system to successfully perfuse and transplant the first patient to use this technology in 2000 (  Fig 1 ) ( ). This report encouraged other groups to investigate similar methods but with slight modifications to the specific procedures. These innovations led to the current era of EVLP for use for evaluation, preservation, and rehabilitation of organs for transplant. The conceptual framework of EVLP in most cases is to allow for risk assessment for extended criteria organs. This is important because improper organ selection can increase the risk of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) which is the most common cause of death in the first 90 days and impacts short, long and functional outcomes after transplant( ). For this reason, safe donor pool expansion through use of EVLP has stimulated significant enthusiasm and innovation in clinical lung transplantation.</p>

Blue depicts deoxygenated and red oxygenated perfusate. Starting from the left atrium, oxygenated perfusate is returned to the hard-shell reservoir then pumped through an oxygenator and leukocyte filter before reentering the pulmonary artery. In this set up, the oxygenator deoxygenates the perfusate to facilitate evaluation of lung oxygenation potential. The ventilator maintains respiration and controls the concentration of oxygen delivery. Typically, the lungs are ventilated with room air (21% oxygen) and only delivered 100% when an oxygen challenge is performed to gauge maximal potential of the organ to oxygenate the perfusate." /></p>

<p>We propose an automated segmentation pipeline based on deep learning for proton lung MRI segmentation and ventilation-based quantification which improves on our previously reported methodologies in terms of computational efficiency while demonstrating accuracy and robustness. The large data requirement for the proposed framework is made possible by a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Supporting this work is the open-source <em>ANTsRNet</em> —a growing repository of well-known deep learning architectures first introduced here.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed and trained using a custom multilabel Dice metric loss function and a novel template-based data augmentation strategy. Training (including template generation and data augmentation) employed 205 proton MR images and 73 functional lung MRI. Evaluation was performed using data sets of size 63 and 40 images, respectively.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Accuracy for CNN-based proton lung MRI segmentation (in terms of Dice overlap) was left lung: 0.93 ± 0.03, right lung: 0.94 ± 0.02, and whole lung: 0.94 ± 0.02. Although slightly less accurate than our previously reported joint label fusion approach (left lung: 0.95 ± 0.02, right lung: 0.96 ± 0.01, and whole lung: 0.96 ± 0.01), processing time is &lt;1 second per subject for the proposed approach versus ∼30 minutes per subject using joint label fusion. Accuracy for quantifying ventilation defects was determined based on a consensus labeling where average accuracy (Dice multilabel overlap of ventilation defect regions plus normal region) was 0.94 for the CNN method; 0.92 for our previously reported method; and 0.90, 0.92, and 0.94 for expert readers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The proposed framework yields accurate automated quantification in near real time. CNNs drastically reduce processing time after offline model construction and demonstrate significant future potential for facilitating quantitative analysis of functional lung MRI.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Probing lung function under a variety of conditions and/or pathologies has been significantly facilitated by the use of hyperpolarized gas imaging and corresponding quantitative image analysis methodologies. Such developments have provided direction and opportunity for current and future research trends . Computational techniques targeting these imaging technologies permit spatial quantification of localized ventilation with potential for increased reproducibility, resolution, and robustness over traditional spirometry and radiological readings , .</p>

<p>One of the most frequently used image-based biomarkers for the study of pulmonary development and disease is based on the quantification of regions of limited ventilation, also known as <em>ventilation defects</em> . These features have been shown to be particularly salient in a clinical context. For example, ventilation defect volume to total lung volume ratio has been shown to outperform other image-based features in discriminating asthmatics versus nonasthmatics . Ventilation defects have also demonstrated discriminative capabilities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma . These findings, along with related research, have motivated the development of multiple automated and semiautomated segmentation algorithms which have been proposed in the literature (eg, ) and are currently used in a variety of clinical research investigations (eg, ).</p>

<p>we applied it to the evaluation data consisting of the same 62 proton MRI used in . We performed a direct comparison with the JLF method of with an adopted modification that we currently use in our studies. Instead of using the entire atlas set (which would require a large number of pairwise image registrations), we align the center of the image to be segmented with each atlas image and compute a neighborhood cross-correlation similarity metric . We then select the 10 atlas images that are most similar for use in the JLF scheme. The resulting performance numbers (in terms of Dice overlap) are similar to what we obtained previously and are given in  Figure 5 along with the Dice overlap numbers from the CNN-based approach.</p>

<p>To review the recent advances in available technologies for imaging COPD and present the novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) airway imaging technology.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>This is an unstructured review of published evidence of available pulmonary imaging technologies along with a demonstration of state-of-the-art OCT imaging technology of <em>in vivo</em> human and animal airways.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Advanced imaging techniques such as Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging using hyperoloarized noble gases, micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT), and OCT aim to further our understanding of COPD. Lung densitometry can aid in identifying an exacerbation prone phenotype which may have implications for targeting specific therapies to these individuals. MR ventilation scans have the ability to provide a functional and regional distribution of airflow obstruction offering insight into the airway and parenchymal changes induced by COPD. Micro-CT gives a near microscopic view of the terminal bronchioles and alveoli permitting study of the microarchitecture of the lung <em>ex vivo</em> . Optical coherence tomography can visualize the microstructure of the airway walls (epithelium, smooth muscle, blood vessels, cartilage) permitting real time <em>in vivo</em> as well as longitudinal evaluation of airway changes in patients with COPD.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Advanced imaging techniques play a vital role in expanding our current understanding of COPD.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is an exceedingly common and debilitating disease affecting approximately 6.5% of adults in the United States ( ). A disease primarily brought on by tobacco smoke and environmental exposures ( ), it accounts for approximately 10 million physician office visits, 1.5 million Emergency Department visits, and 700,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States ( ). For these reasons, the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) was implemented in 1998, focusing on awareness of the burden of disease and to encourage greater research interest in this area ( ). Despite the increased awareness of COPD, the mortality rate has not decreased ( ). COPD is now the fourth leading cause of death worldwide and the World Health Organization has projected it to be the third leading cause by 2030, trailing only heart disease and stroke ( ).</p>

<p>The mainstay of clinical evaluation and management of COPD is based on symptom assessment and spirometry. At this time, thoracic imaging is only supplemental, aiding in prediction of acute exacerbations ( , ) and planning for advanced procedures such as lung volume reduction surgery ( ) or endobronchial valve/coiling ( ). However, advanced thoracic imaging techniques play a vital role in the research arena, aiding and advancing our understanding of COPD. The most common clinical imaging techniques performed in patients with COPD are plain film X-ray and standard multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). These imaging techniques are robust, well validated, and allow indirect visualization of emphysema, air trapping, and hyperinflation. However, their current resolution and limitations do not permit functional evaluation or direct visualization of the microarchitecture, such as alveoli and terminal bronchioles, which are the site of pathology in COPD.</p>

Researchers have refined and optimized techniques across a range of imaging modalities to generate structural, functional, and metabolic information, with the ultimate goal of translation into the clinical realm. This data becomes particularly useful when used to develop biomarkers for disease pathology or to understand physiological mechanisms of these diseases.</p>

<p>Traditionally, radiologists and clinicians have relied primarily on computed tomography (CT) to gain a better understanding of pulmonary diseases. Yet the cost and need for ionizing radiation have limited the use of CT. When used in conjunction with different modalities–including single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance (MR), hyperpolarized gas MR, hyperpolarized  13 C MR – clinicians and researchers can generate a more comprehensive understanding of pulmonary function.</p>

<p>In the past several years, hyperpolarized gas MR studies in particular have advanced beyond the initial feasibility stage and developed into thorough investigations obtaining detailed quantitative information regarding gas mechanics, lung microstructure, and metabolism. Combining complementary material from various imaging modalities can help to pathogenically and quantitatively characterize a variety of lung disorders.</p>

<p>The articles in this special issue highlight the progress made in understanding these pulmonary diseases and conditions–either by improving imaging sequences and techniques directly, building upon reconstruction methods, developing new perfusion techniques, or combining modalities. This work promises great potential in translation to the clinical world, in particular, the staging and diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p>This series of papers represents some of the most significant advancements made in applying biomedical imaging technology to the understanding of such diseases today. They draw from the strengths of a range of techniques and methodologies, generating complementary measurements and observations that together provide a comprehensive understanding of lung function and physiology.</p>

<p>While CT used alone may be limited in scope, researchers can utilize innovative analysis tools to extract useful information from CT images. Han et al. used voxel-wise parametric response mapping to study changes in disease progression in smokers. This study imaged smokers both with and without COPD and compared changes in lung density between matched inspiratory and expiratory CT images taken 5 years apart from each other. Conducting parametric response mapping analysis on these images can differentiate between normal lung parenchyma, nonemphysematous air-trapping, and emphysema. This study confirmed small airway disease as a radiographic precursor to emphysema, a finding suggested by previous studies. Early diagnosis of emphysema can be critical in preventing further complications, such as functional decline, lung cancer, and respiratory exacerbations.</p>

Therefore, new diagnostic approaches are required that can detect CF lung disease in children and monitor treatment response. Hyperpolarized (HP) gas (  129 Xe and  3 He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, emergent tool for mapping regional lung function and may be well suited for studying pediatric CF. HP gas MRI is well tolerated, reproducible, and it can be performed longitudinally without the need for ionizing radiation. In particular, quantification of the distribution of ventilation, or ventilation defect percent (VDP), has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of CF lung disease and correlates well with pulmonary function tests.</p>

<p>This article presents the current state of CF diagnosis and treatment and describes the potential role of HP gas MRI for detection of early CF lung disease and following the effects of interventions. The typical HP gas imaging workflow is described, along with a discussion of image analysis to calculate VDP, dosing considerations, and the reproducibility of VDP.</p>

<p>The potential use of VDP as an outcome measure in CF is discussed, by considering the correlation with pulmonary function measures, preliminary interventional studies, and case studies involving longitudinal imaging and pulmonary exacerbations.</p>

<p>Finally, emerging HP gas imaging techniques such as multiple breath washout imaging are introduced, followed by a discussion of future directions. Overall, HP gas MRI biomarkers are expected to provide sensitive outcome measures that can be used in disease surveillance as well as interventional studies involving novel CF therapies.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h2 id="brief-review-of-cf">Brief Review of CF</h2>

<p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic, autosomal recessive genetic condition that results from loss of function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene ( ). Lung disease resulting from impaired mucociliary clearance, leading to recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation, remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Episodic worsening of respiratory symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), is treated with antibiotics and is a typical manifestation of this disease. Although there is no known cure, the life span and quality of life for patients with CF have increased dramatically in the past 40 years due to improved treatments, among other factors ( ). Conventional CF therapeutic approaches include (i) targeting the cycle of infection and inflammation with inhaled antibiotics ( ) and anti-inflammatory medications ( ), (ii) improving mucociliary clearance by the rehydration of airway secretions with hypertonic saline ( ), and (iii) thinning the tenacious airway mucus with recombinant dornase alfa ( ). More recently, small molecule medications have been developed that increase the capacity of dysfunctional CFTR protein to conduct chloride and bicarbonate across the cellular membrane ( ). As new treatments become available for this disease, sensitive tests to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments, especially in children with milder pulmonary disease, will be crucial to guide treatment decisions.</p>

<h2 id="current-diagnostic-approaches-and-limitations">Current Diagnostic Approaches and Limitations</h2>

<p>Lung disease begins early in the life of pediatric CF patients and, if left untreated, leads to structural lung damage (e.g., bronchiectasis) that is often focal and irreversible ( ). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), such as spirometry are performed once children are old enough to be able to properly complete the test. Spirometry measures air flow at the mouth, and the most commonly reported parameter is the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ). FEV  1 is reproducible, relatively effort independent and a low FEV  1 is an excellent marker of pulmonary disability; however, the average rate of annual FEV  1 decline in children with CF is small (i.e., 1%–2.5% per year) ( ) and most children with CF have normal FEV  1 ( ). Therefore, tests that are more sensitive than spirometry are required to accurately reflect the degree of lung pathology and to monitor response to therapy in CF, especially in the early lung disease seen in pediatric patients.</p>

Since initial preclinical studies, the speed and efficiency of washin imaging have improved to a point where clinical translation is now possible ( ). For example, images can be acquired with a variable flip angle trajectory ( ), and a computer-controlled gas delivery system can be used to dispense metered doses of HP gas mixed with O  2 ( ).</p>

Therefore, new diagnostic approaches are required that can detect CF lung disease in children and monitor treatment response. Hyperpolarized (HP) gas ( 129 Xe and 3 He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, emergent tool for mapping regional lung function and may be well suited for studying pediatric CF. HP gas MRI is well tolerated, reproducible, and it can be performed longitudinally without the need for ionizing radiation. In particular, quantification of the distribution of ventilation, or ventilation defect percent (VDP), has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of CF lung disease and correlates well with pulmonary function tests.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Multibreath Hyperpolarized3 He Imaging Scheme to Measure Alveolar Oxygen Tension and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient</title><link href="https://clinicaltree.github.io/posts/multibreath-hyperpolarized3-he-imaging-scheme-to-measure-alveolar-oxygen-tension-and-apparent-diffus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Multibreath Hyperpolarized3 He Imaging Scheme to Measure Alveolar Oxygen Tension and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient" /><published>2019-02-28T17:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-04-10T03:59:08+00:00</updated><id>https://clinicaltree.github.io/posts/multibreath-hyperpolarized3-he-imaging-scheme-to-measure-alveolar-oxygen-tension-and-apparent-diffus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://clinicaltree.github.io/posts/multibreath-hyperpolarized3-he-imaging-scheme-to-measure-alveolar-oxygen-tension-and-apparent-diffus/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="rationale-and-objectives">Rationale and Objectives</h2>

<p>In this study, we compared a newly developed multibreath simultaneous alveolar oxygen tension and apparent diffusion coefficient ( <em>P</em> A O  2 -ADC) imaging sequence to a single-breath acquisition, with the aim of mitigating the compromising effects of intervoxel flow and slow-filling regions on single-breath measurements, especially in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>Both single-breath and multibreath simultaneous <em>P</em> A O  2 -ADC imaging schemes were performed on a total of 10 human subjects (five asymptomatic smokers and five COPD subjects). Estimated <em>P</em> A O  2 and ADC values derived from the different sequences were compared both globally and regionally. The distribution of voxels with nonphysiological values was also compared between the two schemes.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>The multibreath protocol decreased the ventilation defect volumes by an average of 12.9 ± 6.6%. The multibreath sequence generated nonphysiological <em>P</em> A O  2 values in 11.0 ± 8.5% fewer voxels than the single-breath sequence. Single-breath <em>P</em> A O  2 maps also showed more regions with gas-flow artifacts and general signal heterogeneity. On average, the standard deviation of the <em>P</em> A O  2 distribution was 16.5 ± 7.0% lower using multibreath <em>P</em> A O  2 -ADC imaging, suggesting a more homogeneous gas distribution. Both mean and standard deviation of the ADC increased significantly from single- to multibreath imaging ( <em>p</em> = 0.048 and <em>p</em> = 0.070, respectively), suggesting more emphysematous regions in the slow-filling lung.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Multibreath <em>P</em> A O  2 -ADC imaging provides superior accuracy and efficiency compared to previous imaging protocols. <em>P</em> A O  2 and ADC maps generated by multibreath imaging allowed for the qualification of various regions as emphysematous or obstructed, which single-breath <em>P</em> A O  2 maps can only identify as defects. The simultaneous <em>P</em> A O  2 and ADC measurements generated by the presented multibreath method were also more physiologically realistic, and allowed for more detailed analysis of the slow-filling regions characteristic of COPD subjects.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Hyperpolarized (HP) gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as a technique capable of safely detecting a variety of changes in the lungs such as air flow restriction, airspace enlargement, decreased tissue perfusion, alveolar membrane thickening, and air trapping ( ), thereby expanding upon the parameters available from conventional modalities like computed tomography and x-ray imaging, and enabling the accurate, regional evaluation of gas flow and uptake ( ).</p>

<p>Two parameters that HP gas MRI is uniquely capable of assessing are regional alveolar oxygen tension ( <em>P</em> A O  2 ), which reflects oxygen delivery to the parenchyma and uptake into the blood, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which describes the diffusion of gas within various regions of the lung. Because <em>P</em> A O  2 reflects the balance between gas replacement through ventilation and uptake into the blood, it is sensitive to early manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an inflammatory lung condition causing chronic obstruction of airflow. ADC, on the other hand, is primarily indicative of structural changes in alveolar size and connectivity that are expected later in disease progression ( ). Often acquired simultaneously and coregistered, <em>P</em> A O  2 and ADC can serve as important indicators of pathophysiological changes in the lungs ( ), and together provide a more comprehensive portrait of lung function and structure than is available with other methods—increasing sensitivity to early subclinical alterations and, thereby, diagnostic power ( ).</p>

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly heterogeneous and not well understood. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe129) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique way to assess important lung functions such as gas uptake. In this pilot study, we exploited multiple imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), gadolinium-enhanced perfusion MRI, and Xe129 MRI, to perform a detailed investigation of changes in lung morphology and functions in COPD. Utility and strengths of Xe129 MRI in assessing COPD were also evaluated against the other imaging modalities.</p>

<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>

<p>Four COPD patients and four age-matched normal subjects participated in this study. Lung tissue density measured by CT, perfusion measures from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and ventilation and gas uptake measures from Xe129 MRI were calculated for individual lung lobes to assess regional changes in lung morphology and function, and to investigate correlations among the different imaging modalities.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>No significant differences were found for all measures among the five lobes in either the COPD or age-matched normal group. Strong correlations ( <em>R</em> &gt; 0.5 or &lt; −0.5, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) were found between ventilation and perfusion measures. Also gas uptake by blood as measured by Xe129 MRI showed strong correlations with CT tissue density and ventilation measures ( <em>R</em> &gt; 0.5 or &lt; −0.5, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) and moderate to strong correlations with perfusion measures ( <em>R</em> &gt; 0.4 or &lt; −0.5, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). Four distinctive patterns of functional abnormalities were found in patients with COPD.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Xe129 MRI has high potential to uniquely identify multiple changes in lung physiology in COPD using a single breath-hold acquisition.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability around the world. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of COPD are still primarily based on irreversible airflow limitation measured by spirometry. However, multiple studies reported heterogeneous phenotypes of COPD that are far more complicated than being simply defined by irreversible airflow limitation ( ). Loss of lung function and abnormalities of gas exchange develop early ( ) and increase in prevalence as the severity of COPD increases ( ). Chronic hypoxemia was reported to be closely related to decline in the patient’s quality of life, reduced exercise tolerance, and greater risk of death ( ).</p>

<p>There are numerous unanswered questions about the mechanisms of hypoxemia in COPD. Whether hypoxemia is merely caused by ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch or diffusion impairment is unclear ( ). Conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine scans, have limitations in the assessment of COPD. For example, chest CT provides detailed information about changes in lung morphometry, such as emphysema and bronchiectasis ( ), but limited information about lung function. Dual energy chest CT scan can provide iodine distribution maps, which can be used as a surrogate for pulmonary perfusion ( ). Nuclear medicine V/Q scan quantifies ventilation and perfusion ( ), but with limited spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, pulmonary function testing (PFT) provides whole lung measurements of lung function, but lacks regional localization of abnormalities. Therefore, reliable, noninvasive imaging techniques that can offer detailed assessment and accurate quantification of regional lung function will not only promote the understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD, but will also provide directions for treatment and valuable information about prognosis.</p>

<p>To assess the repeatability of global and regional lung ventilation quantification in both healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using fluorinated (  19 F) gas washout magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in free breathing.</p>

<h2 id="material-and-methods">Material and Methods</h2>

<p>In this prospective institutional review board-approved study, 12 healthy nonsmokers and eight COPD patients were examined with  19 F dynamic gas washout MR imaging in free breathing and with lung function testing. Measurements were repeated within 2 weeks. Lung ventilation was quantified using  19 F gas washout time. Repeatability was analyzed for the total lung and on a regional basis using the coefficient of variation (COV) and Bland–Altman plots.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>In healthy subjects and COPD patients, a good repeatability was found for lung ventilation quantification using dynamic  19 F gas washout MR imaging on a global (COV &lt; 8%) and regional (COV &lt; 15%) level. Gas washout time was significantly increased in the COPD group compared to the healthy subjects.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>19 F gas washout MR imaging provides a good repeatability of lung ventilation quantification and appears to be sensitive to early changes of regional lung function alterations such as normal aging.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Functional pulmonary imaging to assess regional lung ventilation is a promising technique to further investigate lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in order to improve its diagnosis and treatment. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noninvasive, free of ionizing radiation, and offers several methods to probe lung function it has a high potential to be translated into clinical routine ( ).</p>

<p>Obviously, pulmonary gas MRI enables visualization of the respiratory tract and therefore provides regional information of lung ventilation ( ). To overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gas MRI arising from the lower spin-density and higher diffusivity, mainly hyperpolarized gases are proposed as pulmonary gas tracers ( ). Alternatively, fluorinated (  19 F) gases like sulfur hexafluoride (SF  6 ), tetrafluoromethane (CF  4 ), hexafluoroethane (C  2 F  6 ), and perfluoropropane (C  3 F  8 ) can be used at thermal polarization ( ). Fluorinated gases are nontoxic, chemically inert, and have a low solubility in water and blood. The relaxation of the fluorinated gases is dominated by spin–rotation interaction mediated by molecular collisions. Therefore, in a mixture with oxygen, which has a significantly lower molecular weight than the fluorinated gases, the collision rates increase and therefore T  1 and T  2 relaxation times of the fluorinated gases decrease with increasing concentration of oxygen ( ). Inhalation of a normoxic fluorinated gas mixture over several minutes did not show any adverse effects ( ). Their short longitudinal relaxation time T  1 (ranging from 1.8 ms for SF  6 up to 18 ms for C  3 F  8 at 1.5 T for the pure gas at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure) facilitates efficient  19 F gas MRI at short repetition times. Therefore, fluorinated gases provide sufficient SNR for pulmonary MRI in humans even at thermal polarization ( ).</p>
