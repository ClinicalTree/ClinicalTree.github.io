In the preface to the fifth edition of _Head and Neck Imaging_ , Peter M. Som and Hugh D. Curtin say they attempted to produce “as complete a reference on the topics of head and neck imaging as possible.” While such a task may be daunting, at a length of 2948 pages, the authors have clearly put forth a valiant effort—and a largely successful one.

The book is divided into 47 chapters spread over 8 sections: Midface and Sinonasal Cavities, Orbit and Visual Pathways, Central Skull Base, Temporal bone, Jaws and Temporomandibular Joints, Upper Aerodigestive Tract, Neck, and Molecular-Based Diagnosis, and Nonsurgical Treatment of Cancer. Each chapter is well-organized with innumerable computed tomography and magnetic resonance images, multiple histology and gross pathology photos, anatomy drawings, and multiple boxes and tables to summarize the information.

Compared to the fourth edition, published in 2003, the authors have made some substantial changes that improve an already impressive reference. Perhaps the strongest new asset is the addition of color throughout book, which is particularly useful for the numerous pathology and histology pictures as well as the expanded positron emission tomography/computed tomography and anatomy sections. Multiple Frank Netter and Gray's Anatomy drawings now supplement the well-annotated imaging atlases. I found the chapter on Imaging Based Intervention particularly helpful, with multiple schematics of biopsy techniques. Gone from the prior edition are most of the plain film images because their use is uncommon in the current practice of head and neck radiology. Another noticeable absence from the prior edition is an outline at the beginning of each chapter, though these may have been redundant given the extensive index.

The fifth edition is also now associated with the new Expert Consult series from Elsevier. This new relationship has brought the entire text online, which is particularly advantageous because a 2-volume textbook weighing almost 22 pounds is not exactly portable for radiologists who practice at multiple sites. The ability to search the entire text and access images online is a definite bonus. I did, however, find the online content difficult to use via mobile devices.

The completeness of the text is truly a double-edged sword. I have heard many people refer to this book as “the source” for head and neck radiology, with complete coverage of most topics. However, its massive size makes it impractical for most radiology trainees and practicing general radiologists. A more condensed version, perhaps as part of Elsevier's High Yield Imaging series, would likely reach a larger audience. Nonetheless, the fifth edition of Som and Curtin's Head and Neck Imaging remains an invaluable resource and an authoritative text in the field.
