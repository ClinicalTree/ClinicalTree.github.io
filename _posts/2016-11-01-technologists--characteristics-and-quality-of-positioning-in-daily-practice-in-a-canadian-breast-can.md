## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluates to what extent technologists' experience, training, or practice in mammography are associated with screening mammography positioning quality.

## Materials and Methods

Positioning quality of a random sample of 1278 mammograms drawn from the 394,190 screening examinations performed in 2004–2005 in the Breast Cancer Screening Program of Quebec (Canada) was evaluated by an expert radiologist. Information on technologists' experience, training, and practice was obtained by mailed questionnaire. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust estimation of variance were used to assess the association of technologists' characteristics with higher positioning quality.

## Results

Of 254 randomly selected technologists, 220 (86.6%) completed the questionnaire. Participating technologists did 89.2% of available sampled mammograms (1088 of 1220), of which 45.9% were of higher positioning quality. Technologists who, in addition to mandatory training, followed at least 15 hours of hands-on training in positioning performed higher positioning quality (adjusted ratio = 1.3, 95%CI = 1.1–1.5) than technologists with no such additional training. Technologists providing at least 15 hours of continued medical education also performed higher positioning quality (adjusted ratio = 1.3, 95%CI = 1.1–1.5) than those who provided less than 15 hours of continued medical education. Being involved in film development and proportion of mammograms performed that are screening compared to diagnostic were also associated with positioning quality, although the latter association was less clear.

## Conclusions

Extra hands-on training in positioning could further improve screening mammography positioning quality in the screening program because many technologists did not have such additional training.

## Introduction

Mammography quality is believed to influence sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening. One study suggested that lower quality of positioning may reduce screening sensitivity . Other studies have suggested that poor mammography quality, including poor positioning, is associated with missed cancers or later stage at diagnosis . Positioning is the aspect of mammography quality that is most frequently suboptimal . This finding was also observed in the Quebec Breast Cancer Screening Program .

Mammography technologists play a central role in the achievement of high-quality mammograms as they are responsible for positioning of the breasts. However, how technologists' characteristics influence mammography quality is understudied. Only two studies concerning the association between technologists' characteristics and mammography quality were identified. New technologists were found to perform better positioning quality than experienced technologists in one recent European study . In another study conducted in the Chicago area, facilities relying only on technologists dedicated to mammography were not found to perform higher quality mammograms than facilities relying on technologists with a mixed practice . These studies each analyzed only one technologists' characteristic. To our knowledge, no study has examined the association of a wide range of technologists' characteristics such as experience, training, and practice, with mammography quality.
