## Highlights

- High-pitch allows for significant reduction ( _P_ < .001) of motion artifacts.

- Free breathing allows for significant reduction of Valsalva maneuver.

- High-pitch provides diagnostic confidence without the need for patient compliance.

- High-pitch at 80 kVp allows for significant dose reduction ( _P_ < .001).
