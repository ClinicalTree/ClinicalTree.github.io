## Rationale and Objectives

We compared the radiation dose and diagnostic accuracy on 120- and 100-kVp coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans whose contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was the same.

## Materials and Methods

We studied 1311 coronary artery segments from 100 patients. For 120-kVp scans, the targeted image level was set at 25 Hounsfield units (HU). For 100-kVp scans, the targeted noise level was set at 30 HU to obtain the same CNR as at 120 kVp. We compared the CNR and the radiation dose on scans acquired at 120 and 100 kVp. Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) images were evaluated by an interventional coronary angiography specialist, and CCTA images were evaluated by a radiologist. Coronary artery disease was defined as a luminal narrowing ≧50% for ICA and CCTA. With ICA considered the gold standard, the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value) was analyzed on both 120- and 100-kVp CCTA images. We also compared the diagnostic accuracy for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the ICA and CCTA performed at 120 and 100 kVp. Two blinded observers visually evaluated the septal branch.

## Results

The mean dose-length product was 48% lower at 100 kVp than at 120 kVp ( _P_ < .01). Under the 120-kVp CCTA protocol, the area under the curve, 95% confidence interval, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.94%, 0.91%–0.96%, 94.0%, 93.0%, 82.3%, and 98.1%, respectively; at 100 kVp these values were 0.94%, 0.92%–0.97%, 96.1%, 92.0%, 85.2%, and 98.0%, respectively. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed no significant difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two protocols ( _P_ = .87).

## Conclusions

At the same CNR, the 100-kVp CCTA protocol may help to reduce the radiation dose by approximately 50% compared to the 120-kVp protocol without degradation of diagnostic accuracy.

## Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is an alternative to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) , although its delivery of a higher radiation dose is of concern . To reduce the radiation dose, prospective electrocardiogram triggering with block-wise , high-pitch spiral scanning , automatic tube current modulation , a combination of automatic tube current modulation and automatic tube voltage selection , and lower tube voltage techniques have been introduced.

Application of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) index of the image noise to low tube voltage scans reduced the radiation dose delivered at computed tomography angiography . However, the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA scans obtained at 100 and 120 kVp with the same CNR remained to be compared.
