## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to evaluate if navigator-echo respiratory-triggered magnetic resonance acquisition can acquire supine high-quality breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

Supine respiratory-triggered magnetic resonance imaging (Trig-MRI) was compared to supine non-Trig-MRI to evaluate breathing-induced motion artifacts (group 1), and to conventional prone non-Trig-MRI (group 2, 16-channel breast coil), all at 3T. A 32-channel thorax coil was placed on top of a cover to prevent breast deformation. Ten volunteers were scanned in each group, including one patient. The acquisition time was recorded. Image quality was compared by visual examination and by calculation of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and image sharpness (IS).

## Results

Scan time increased from 56.5 seconds (non-Trig-MRI) to an average of 306 seconds with supine Trig-MRI (range: 120–540 seconds). In group 1, the median values (interquartile range) of SNR, CNR, and IS improved from 11.5 (6.0), 7.3 (3.1), and 0.23 (0.2) cm on supine non-Trig-MRI to 38.1 (29.1), 32.8 (29.7), and 0.12 (0) cm (all _P_ < 0.01) on supine Trig-MRI _._ All qualitative image parameters in group 1 improved on supine Trig-MRI (all _P_ < 0.01) _._ In group 2, SNR and CNR improved from 14.7 (6.8) and 12.6 (5.6) on prone non-Trig-MRI to 36.2 (12.2) and 32.7 (12.1) (both _P_ < 0.01) on supine Trig-MRI. IS was similar: 0.10 (0) cm vs 0.11 (0) cm ( _P_ = 0.88) _._

## Conclusions

Acquisition of high-quality supine breast MRI is possible when respiratory triggering is applied, in a similar setup as during subsequent treatment. Image quality improved when compared to supine non-triggered breast MRI and prone breast MRI, but at the cost of increased acquisition time.

## Introduction

Breast-conserving surgery can be challenging in patients with small or non-palpable tumors, where tumor palpation is hampered . Therefore, accurate tumor localization during surgery is essential for achieving negative resection margins and for avoiding re-excisions and local recurrences. Several technologies have been developed to guide the surgeon, such as wire-guided localization and radioactive seed localization . Both methods have led to a decrease in positive resection margins but provide only surrogate position information about the tumor, not the actual 3-D shape and position information with respect to the tumor border.

Recently, Fichtinger et al. have proposed the use of an electromagnetic navigation system for intraoperative tumor tracking in combination with wire-guided localization . Preoperatively, an electromagnetically tracked localization needle is placed over the wire guide under ultrasound guidance. Subsequently, a tracked ultrasound system is used for delineation of the tumor. During surgery, the tracked tumor is shown in combination with a tracked cautery on the navigation screen. This system was found to be safe and feasible by evaluation on six palpable tumors. However, non-palpable tumors are often occult on ultrasound , challenging tumor visualization and delineation.

Notice the reduced contrast in signal intensity between the tumor and the surrounding fibroglandular tissue in the supine Trig-MRI; this reduced contrast is probably due to the prolonged acquisition time resulting in less optimal timing of the contrast agent.
