Accurately identifying nodal metastases at the time of radical prostatectomy in men with prostate cancer is important for achieving optimal staging and consideration of additional therapy. Providing adjuvant hormonal treatment to men with nodal metastases prolongs disease-free survival and can improve cancer-specific survival as well . In addition, knowledge of the location of nodal metastases impacts planning of conformal radiotherapy and may guide the extent of lymphadenectomy .

Despite the postulated benefits of lymphadenectomy, considerable variability exists in surgeons' approach to performing lymph node dissection at the time of radical prostatectomy. A limited pelvic lymph node dissection targeting nodes within the obturator fossa is a commonly applied scheme . A limited obturator dissection provides partial nodal sampling of the pelvis to guide staging without requiring additional dissection beyond the requisite surgical bed of the prostate. This approach is supported by a traditional perception that the frequency of nodal metastasis is very low, such that more extensive dissection is generally not warranted .

More recently, the appropriateness of a limited pelvic nodal dissection has been questioned . Prostate cancer nodal metastatic disease is frequently solitary , although does not consistently first involve the obturator fossa before involving other, more remote, sites. Rather, potential sites of initial involvement are widespread, including the obturator fossa, iliac chains, presacral space, and para-aortic region . This variation contributes to reports of a higher frequency of nodal metastasis than reported by earlier investigations based on limited nodal dissections . In one study, up to 75% of nodal metastases were missed by performing solely an obturator dissection .

The primary alternative approach is to perform an extended pelvic lymph node dissection that routinely incorporates more cranial dissection of the external and common iliac, presacral, and para-aortic regions. The act of performing an extended lymph node dissection is more likely to remove lymph node metastases than a limited sampling and has been postulated by some authors to improve disease-free survival . However, this potential benefit has not been clearly established, and any overall therapeutic benefit of extended lymphadenectomy in men with nodal metastasis remains highly controversial. Poor preoperative localization of nodal metastases may in fact limit the benefit of even an extended lymphadenectomy, such that improved localization may still be required to improve the theoretical efficacy of lymph node–directed therapy.

In addition to the aforementioned considerations, extended pelvic lymph node dissection also entails greater cost and operative time , as well as substantially greater complications , than limited dissection. Although lymphocele and lymphedema are the most common complications, nerve and ureteral injury are also reported . One study observed that when performing limited and extended nodal dissections on contralateral sides, the complication rate was approximately three times greater on the side undergoing extended dissection . Finally, even an extended nodal dissection does not provide a true gold standard, as this technique has been observed to miss a small fraction of nodal metastases . Given these concerns, as well as persistent uncertainty regarding the actual likelihood of nodal metastatic disease and thus the yield of this procedure, extended pelvic lymph node dissection is not currently widely performed in clinical practice.

Sentinel lymph node evaluation offers what would seem to be a balance between the aims of seeking to identify any metastatic node that may be present and avoiding excessive morbidity from a large number of extended dissections in N0 patients. This approach is based on the principle that if the node serving as the primary nodal drainage site of the prostate, termed the sentinel node, is free of disease, then the presence of nodal metastasis at any site is effectively excluded and that no other lymph nodes warrant evaluation . Sentinel lymph node evaluation is commonly performed via lymphoscintigraphy and has been conducted successfully for breast cancer , penile cancer , and melanoma . For prostate cancer evaluation, a nanoparticle colloid is typically injected into each lobe of the prostate, which then travels via the lymphatic system and is ultimately taken up and retained within the reticuloendothelial system of the sentinel node on each side . Technetium Tc-99m is the radiotracer most commonly bound to the injected colloid . At standardized time intervals after injection, pelvic imaging using a gamma camera is performed to visualize the location of the sentinel node, the reliability of which is improved using single-photon emission computed tomography computed tomography (SPECT/CT) . Finally, intraoperatively, a portable gamma probe is used to confirm the location of the sentinel node, which then undergoes complete resection and careful histologic evaluation . If metastatic, an extended pelvic lymph node dissection is performed. If benign, further nodal dissection is deferred.
