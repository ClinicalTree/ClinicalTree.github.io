Among the most important resources for learning and teaching professionalism are professionals themselves. It is well and good to extoll the virtues of professionalism in the abstract, but such traits really come to life only through the stories of the people who have lived them. Of special interest is how an understanding and commitment to professionalism develop over the course of a career.

One exemplar who has done more than most to advance professionalism is Leonard Berlin, MD. Berlin is widely recognized as radiology's greatest authority on the interface between medicine and the law, and in particular, medical malpractice. But underlying this interest in medicolegal matters is Berlin's deep interest and dedication to professionalism.

Professionalism is not a set of ideas or habits that can be simply bolted on to a physician in an instant. Instead, professionalism represents a natural expression of a personal identity and aspirations that have developed over the course of a lifetime. To understand how Berlin's commitment to professionalism grew and developed over time, we must begin with his biography.

Berlin was born in Chicago in 1935, the son of lower-middle-class parents. His father had emigrated from Latvia as a teenager, and his mother was an American. Though his mother had graduated from high school, his father had no formal education. His father operated an independent grocery store very near Wrigley field.
