Yet another book on chest radiology! There are several excellent introductory chest imaging books such as _Cardiopulmonary Imaging: The Core Curriculum Series_ by Kazerooni and Gross or _Thoracic Imaging: Pulmonary and Cardiovascular Radiology_ , by Webb and Higgins, among others. So _Radiology of Chest Diseases_ competes with a tough and rapidly changing landscape. However, the authors have done an excellent job of gathering superb images and organizing a diverse set of information in a very readable fashion.

The book is easily accessible to a junior radiology resident and should also serve as a good review for the more senior resident preparing for boards. The book should also be useful to the pulmonologist, internist, or other practitioner interested in getting a quick review of the basic radiologic manifestations of chest diseases. The strengths of this book are in the good organization, the excellent cartoon figures used to illustrate chest imaging anatomy, physiology, and pathology—especially Chapter 13, which is a great summary of “Radiographic Signs and Differential Diagnosis.”

Although the book is good at covering the breadth of chest diseases, it certainly is lacking in depth. However, I believe the authors have been able to pack quite a bit of good information within 377 pages. A second criticism that I have for this book, and several other books being produced in this electronic age, is the lack of an accompanying CD with the images. As a teacher, I find that the ability to project selected images from a text during a lecture can enhance the material (while at the same time marketing the book to the audience!). Although there are obvious copyright issues involved, I believe that more authors should consider media in addition to paper, especially in the field of medical imaging. Perhaps Lange and Walsh will do so for their fourth edition in a few years.

As with everything else in medicine, the volume of information is exploding and good organization and approach can go a long way in making a subject understandable. I think the authors have achieved this. As I began, this is yet another book on chest radiology, but I find that with learning medicine, approaching a subject from different perspectives helps to solidify concepts. Thus I would recommend this book to radiology residents even if they have read other excellent books on the subject.
