## Rationale and Objectives

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) of breast can provide functional information on the vascular and structural compartments of tissues in regions identified during simultaneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). NIRS can be acquired during dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to accomplish image-guided spectroscopy of the enhancing regions, potentially increasing the diagnostic specificity of the examination and reducing the number of biopsies performed as a result of inconclusive MRI breast imaging studies.

## Materials and Methods

We combine synergistic attributes of concurrent DCE-MRI and NIRS with a new design of the clinical NIRS breast interface that couples to a standard MR breast coil and allows imaging of variable breast sizes. Spectral information from healthy volunteers and cancer patients is recovered, providing molecular information in regions defined by the segmented MR image volume.

## Results

The new coupling system significantly improves examination utility by allowing improved coupling of the NIR fibers to breasts of all cup sizes and lesion locations. This improvement is demonstrated over a range of breast sizes (cup size A through D) and normal tissue heterogeneity using a group of eight healthy volunteers and two cancer patients. Lesions located in the axillary region and medial-posterior breast are now accessible to NIRS optodes. Reconstructed images were found to have biologically plausible hemoglobin content, oxygen saturation, and water and lipid fractions.

## Conclusions

In summary, a new NIRS/MRI breast interface was developed to accommodate the variation in breast sizes and lesion locations that can be expected in clinical practice. DCE-MRI–guided NIRS quantifies total hemoglobin, oxygenation, and scattering in MR-enhancing regions, increasing the diagnostic information acquired from MR examinations.

Breast cancer is a complex biological disease that presents challenges for detection and diagnosis. Mammography, the current gold standard for breast screening, has an overall sensitivity and specificity reported to be 77% and 97%, respectively, in a randomized multicenter trial . However, the technique is much less effective in women with mammographically dense breasts, in which the sensitivity and specificity fall considerably to 63% and 89%, respectively . Women with more dense breasts have both higher incidence of and mortality from breast cancer. They are also the most difficult group to screen with mammography . Therefore, current clinical care includes breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for screening of high-risk patients . DCE-MRI is recommended for screening this population in combination with mammography because it has greater sensitivity than standard mammography, reported to be 93%–100% . Screening specificity with DCE-MRI is less consistent. It generally causes 3- to 5-fold more false-positive findings than mammography, leading to more unnecessary biopsies and invasive procedures that are stressful for patients. In this study, the coupling of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with breast MRI is examined with a new interface that allows substantially improved flexibility in delivering the combined examination to the breast than previous versions.

Combined NIRS and MRI is an emerging imaging approach that could benefit patients after screening by increasing the specificity of DCE-MRI before biopsy . The technique can be used to noninvasively quantify oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, water and lipid content, and scattering parameters in adipose and fibroglandular tissues. Combined NIRS and MRI systems have been developed in the United States and Germany for human imaging , but they have been slow to progress because of design challenges and cost. However, incentives exist to develop MRI/NIRS based on promising results from stand-alone NIRS. Hundreds of patients have undergone stand-alone NIRS breast imaging at multiple academic centers in the United States and Europe . In addition, several commercial systems have been developed . The sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection with NIRS alone varies depending on the system geometry but has been reported to be in the range of 91%–96% and 93%–95%, respectively . Because MRI information can be used to guide image reconstruction in MRI/NIRS, the technique may improve on the stand-alone NIRS results, especially when lesions are smaller than 1–2 cm. The spatial correlation between the data streams of MRI and NIRS has the potential to provide complementary information .

We also use a modified Tikhonov regularization routine with regularization parameter, _λ_ , using a Levenberg–Marquardt iterative update, which stabilizes the estimation process by reducing the effects of noise on the image reconstruction, and eliminating improbable solutions .
