## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the relationship between measurements of lung volume (LV) on inspiratory/expiratory computed tomography (CT) scans, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and CT measurements of emphysema in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-six smokers (20 females and 26 males; age range 46–81 years), enrolled in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, underwent PFT and chest CT at full inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory LV values were automatically measured by open-source software, and the expiratory/inspiratory (E/I) ratio of LV was calculated. Mean lung density (MLD) and low attenuation area percent (<−950 HU) were also measured. Correlations of LV measurements with lung function and other CT indices were evaluated by the Spearman rank correlation test.

## Results

LV E/I ratio significantly correlated with the following: the percentage of predicted value of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV  1 ), the ratio of FEV  1 to forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratio of residual volume (RV) to total lung capacity (TLC) (FEV  1 %P, R = −0.56, _P_ < .0001; FEV  1 /FVC, _r_ = −0.59, _P_ < .0001; RV/TLC, _r_ = 0.57, _P_ < .0001, respectively). A higher correlation coefficient was observed between expiratory LV and expiratory MLD ( _r_ = −0.73, _P_ < .0001) than between inspiratory LV and inspiratory MLD ( _r_ = −0.46, _P_ < .01). LV E/I ratio showed a very strong correlation to MLD E/I ratio ( _r_ = 0.95, _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

LV E/I ratio can be considered to be equivalent to MLD E/I ratio and to reflect airflow limitation and air-trapping. Higher collapsibility of lung volume, observed by inspiratory/expiratory CT, indicates less severe conditions in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

With the development of imaging analysis using computed tomography (CT) in individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), several quantitative CT indices have been advocated and proved to be significant for predicting lung function. The more commonly used indices are the percentage of low attenuation area (LAA%) and mean lung density (MLD). Further, these indices on expiratory CT scans have been often reported to be stronger predictors for lung function than those on inspiratory scans . Regarding MLD, it is also known that the expiratory/inspiratory (E/I) ratio of MLD demonstrates significant correlations with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) .

In contrast, lung volume (LV) measured by CT has not been as rigorously assessed in subjects with COPD. Although inspiratory/expiratory LV and plethysmographic measures of total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) , the relationship between CT-based LV measurements, including LV E/I ratio, and airflow limitation or air-trapping is still undefined.
