_Diagnostic and Surgical Imaging Anatomy: Ultrasound_ by A. T. Ahuja et al, as the title suggests, is the ultrasound component in the Amirsys collection of textbooks for viewing, understanding, and, in this case, performing anatomical imaging. As with the entire series, the _Ultrasound_ installment continues the excellence in image quality with the expanse of images for which they are known. In addition to the outstanding pictorial drawings, another hallmark of the Amirsys collection, there are also appropriate planar selections from computed tomography or magnetic resonance images providing further correlation to the sonographic images. The authors also take into account the unique imaging prospective ultrasound allows as an operator dependent modality; therefore, each image contains an adjacent schematic display of the orientation and placement of the ultrasound transducer.

The text abides by the standard format of the Amirsys series with each section dedicated to a particular region of the body. Sections are then further broken down into specific organs or regions of interest within that portion of the body.

Each specific topic has a one- to two-page bulleted format introduction, describing basic terminology to be reviewed, followed by a gross and imaging anatomy description. For example, the section on the elbow details what composes the joint capsule continuing with an in-depth discussion of each of the ligaments, then tendons, and finishing with the bursa. The introduction typically concludes with “anatomy-based imaging issues,” which entails recommendations for imaging the particular region including the approach, the transducer to use, and how to achieve the best images. This segment also contains extremely important information on pitfalls to be aware of when imaging the structure of interest. Several of the topic pages have an additional section on clinical implications, which provides more insight into why ultrasound is useful in imaging a particular body part and disease entities of which to be aware.

The introduction is followed by the schematic drawing(s) detailing the anatomy to be imaged. This is succeeded by the focus of the textbook, numerous multiplanar sonographic images of the body part of interest, which are extremely well labeled, and a description of each of the ultrasound images at the bottom of the page. As discussed earlier, applicable computed tomography and magnetic resonance images are also provided where relevant and each of the ultrasound images has a small schematic of the transducer positioning and the appropriate angulation.

As for the information provided, the introductions are succinct and if you appreciate the bullet format for rapidity in presenting information, you will not be disappointed. However, the presentation makes this a text few, if any, can read straight through. Instead, it allows quick reference and excellent descriptions of how and what one needs to know to image a body part, be it a resident, fellow, or practicing radiologist. The images also serve as an excellent reference for learning and understanding anatomy for a resident starting in ultrasound or a practicing radiologist who may be delving into imaging unfamiliar body parts such as musculoskeletal ultrasound. Although the information provided maybe beyond what is needed of a medical student, the anatomical imaging definitely provides a greater understanding.

The schematics of transducer placement are particularly useful. The accuracy and sonographic images are top quality. Spectral Doppler imaging and waveform analysis are presented throughout the text adding insight and a better appreciation for the strengths of ultrasound as a real-time imaging modality. Several of the topics have added features and images of typical disease entities, which although beyond the scope of the text, are valuable as comparisons to the normal anatomy. Although it is understandable why this cannot be included with every section given the text is already lengthy, the information garnered is helpful, and a more liberal use of these comparisons throughout all sections would be appreciated.
