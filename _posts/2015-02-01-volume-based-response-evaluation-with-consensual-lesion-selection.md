## Rationale and Objectives

Lesion volume is considered as a promising alternative to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) to make tumor measurements more accurate and consistent, which would enable an earlier detection of temporal changes. In this article, we report the results of a pilot study aiming at evaluating the effects of a consensual lesion selection on volume-based response (VBR) assessments.

## Materials and Methods

Eleven patients with lung computed tomography scans acquired at three time points were selected from Reference Image Database to Evaluate Response to therapy in lung cancer (RIDER) and proprietary databases. Images were analyzed according to RECIST 1.1 and VBR criteria by three readers working in different geographic locations. Cloud solutions were used to connect readers and carry out a consensus process on the selection of lesions used for computing response. Because there are not currently accepted thresholds for computing VBR, we have applied a set of thresholds based on measurement variability (−35% and +55%). The benefit of this consensus was measured in terms of multiobserver agreement by using Fleiss kappa (κ  fleiss ) and corresponding standard errors (SE).

## Results

VBR after consensual selection of target lesions allowed to obtain κ  fleiss = 0.85 (SE = 0.091), which increases up to 0.95 (SE = 0.092), if an extra consensus on new lesions is added. As a reference, the agreement when applying RECIST without consensus was κ  fleiss = 0.72 (SE = 0.088). These differences were found to be statistically significant according to a z-test.

## Conclusions

An agreement on the selection of lesions allows reducing the inter-reader variability when computing VBR. Cloud solutions showed to be an interesting and feasible strategy for standardizing response evaluations, reducing variability, and increasing consistency of results in multicenter clinical trials.

According to recent statistics of the World Health Organization, cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012 . Lung cancer accounted for 1.6 million deaths (19.4%), which makes it the first cause of cancer death even ahead of liver (9.1%) and stomach (8.8%) cancers. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the standard imaging modality for assessing the response to treatment in patients with solid tumors. In general, the quantification of the response is performed by using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) . In summary, this standard establishes the way of measuring lesions and provides a set of thresholds to classify the response into partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease. In the context of this article, the term RECIST refers to its revised version (1.1) .

Even when RECIST criteria have been broadly adopted in clinical trials, they present some drawbacks that are a source of measurement variability. This is quite inconvenient because the consistency in the production of trial results is necessary for comparison purposes . For example, the lesion size is measured as its longest axial diameter, which is not a robust measure in case of complex lesions and creates problems of accuracy and precision . To cope with this drawback, the use of volume is currently being considered as a promising direction to make tumor measurements more accurate and consistent, which would enable an earlier detection of temporal changes . The benefit of using volume as biomarker has already been reported in the literature ; however, the use of volume also presents some drawbacks like the long segmentation time in case of big lesions (in particular for thin-slice acquisitions) and the lack of accepted thresholds for computing response. Regarding this last point, it is worth mentioning the intensive efforts performed by the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance to better understand volumetric biomarkers and their sources of variability. In the context of this article, the term volume-based response (VBR) refers to the response estimated exactly as established by RECIST, except for the use of volume of lesions and volume-specific thresholds instead of diameters. The use of VBR was preferred to names like 3D-RECIST to avoid confusion with the application of RECIST with 3D-extended thresholds and also because currently there is no formal definition of the volumetric version of RECIST.
