## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the expression levels of green fluorescence protein (GFP) into retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro by ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction (UMMD) and assess the effect of bcl-xl gene on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced apoptosis in the cultured RGCs by UMMD.

## Materials and Methods

pEGFP-N1 was transfected to RGCs in vitro by UMMD and liposome was used as the control. The transfection effect was detected using microscope and flow cytometry qualitatively and quantitatively. Monotetrazolium was adopted to measure the cell vitality. NMDA was used to induce apoptosis in the cultured RGCs, and the bcl-xl gene was transfected into RGCs by UMMD before NMDA-induced apoptosis. The expression of bcl-xl protein in RGCs was assessed by immunohistochemistry assay. The amorphous character of RGCs was revealed by acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining. DNA fragment was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.

## Results

Ultrasound combined with microbubbles enhanced gene transfection to the cultured cells in some condition. The average transfection rate of pEGFP-N1 with UMMD was 25%. Both ultrasound and microbubble had no effect on cell viability. The expression of bcl-xl protein in transfected and non-transfected RGCs was significantly different. Less apoptotic bodies and no representative DNA fragment were detected in the treatment group.

## Conclusions

Microbubble destruction can enhance the reporter gene transfection and expression and have a good target. Transfection of bcl-xl gene has an anti-apoptosis effect on the cultured RGCs induced by NMDA with UMMD.

In recent years, numerous studies have indicated that ultrasonic irradiation itself not only promotes gene transfection and expression in vitro and in vivo and ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction (UMMD) can further enhance gene transfection efficiency . It has become the research hotspot because it is safe, reliable, and low in cost . This study explored the gene transfection efficiency mediated by UMMD in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the related condition in vitro. With the in-depth research in pathogenesis of glaucoma, it is recognized that to reduce intraocular pressure alone is not enough. Other ways to further protect the optic nerve and prevent or delay damage to RGCs need to be considered . Thus the new concept of optic nerve protection treatment has become the glaucoma research direction and focus in 21st century . Because RGC apoptosis is the key link to glaucoma, we established an RGC excitotoxicity injury model and used ultrasound microbubble–mediated anti-apoptotic gene bcl-xl and determined the optimum parameters for transfecting RGCs with the bcl-xl gene and subsequently investigated its effects on RGC apoptosis. We hope we can protect the optic nerve with new ideas.

## Materials and methods

## Preparation of Plasmid Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein N1

Bacillus coli DH5 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was resuscitated by the conventional method and plasmid enhanced green fluorescence protein N1 (pEGFP-N  1 ) was inverted into bacteria by classical calcium chloride method. We extracted plasmid according to Kit (EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit; Qiagen, Germany) requirements. A small amount of plasmid was electrophoresis, and plasmid concentration was adjusted to 1 μg/μL by spectrophotometry.
