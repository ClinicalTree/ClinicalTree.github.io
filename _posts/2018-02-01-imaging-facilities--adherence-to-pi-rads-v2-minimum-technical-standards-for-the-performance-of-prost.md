## Purpose

This study aimed to assess variability in imaging facilities' adherence to the minimum technical standards for prostate magnetic resonance imaging acquisition established by Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 (v2).

## Methods

A total of 107 prostate magnetic resonance imaging examinations performed at 107 unique imaging facilities after the release of PI-RADS v2 and that were referred to a tertiary care center for secondary interpretation were included. Image sets, DICOM headers, and outside reports were reviewed to assess adherence to 21 selected PI-RADS v2 minimum technical standards.

## Results

Hardware arrangements were 23.1%, 1.5T without endorectal coil; 7.7%, 1.5T with endorectal coil; 63.5%, 3T without endorectal coil; and 5.8%, 3T with endorectal coil. Adherence to minimum standards was lowest on T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) for frequency resolution ≤0.4 mm (16.8%) and phase resolution ≤0.7 mm (48.6%), lowest on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for field of view (FOV) 120–220 mm (30.0%), and lowest on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging for slice thickness 3 mm (33.3%) and temporal resolution <10 s (31.5%). High b-value (≥1400 s/mm  2 ) images were included in 58.0% (calculated in 25.9%). Adherence to T2WI phase resolution and DWI inter-slice gap were greater ( _P_ < .05) at 3T than at 1.5T. Adherence did not differ ( _P_ > .05) for any parameter between examinations performed with and without an endorectal coil. Adherence was greater for examinations performed at teaching facilities for T2WI slice thickness and DCE temporal resolution ( _P_ < .05). Adherence was not better for examinations performed in 2016 than in 2015 for any parameter ( _P_ > .05).

## Conclusion

Facilities' adherence to PI-RADS v2 minimum technical standards was variable, being particularly poor for T2WI frequency resolution and DCE temporal resolution. The standards warrant greater community education. Certain technical standards may be too stringent, and revisions should be considered.

## Introduction

The Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 (v2) was developed with the goal of improving the detection and characterization of suspected prostate cancer through multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In support of this goal, its first listed specific aim is to “establish minimum acceptable technical parameters” for prostate MRI. PI-RADS v2 implements this aim by specifying a wide range of explicit acquisition parameters for T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE). The provision of these minimum technical standards is intended to promote robust image quality of prostate MRI across practices.

Much of the attention toward PI-RADS v2 has related to its standards for examination interpretation and reporting. Indeed, increasing peer-reviewed literature supports the diagnostic performance of PI-RADS v2 in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer . However, less attention has been directed toward full dissemination and implementation of the minimum technical standards within PI-RADS v2. Therefore, little is known regarding the success in communication and dissemination of the technical standards by leaders in the field, as well as the success in adherence by individual practices. Moreover, given a paucity of data informing many of the individual standards, the determination of the exact standards relied heavily on expert consensus. Therefore, it remains possible that some of the technical standards are in fact suboptimal and could warrant reconsideration.
