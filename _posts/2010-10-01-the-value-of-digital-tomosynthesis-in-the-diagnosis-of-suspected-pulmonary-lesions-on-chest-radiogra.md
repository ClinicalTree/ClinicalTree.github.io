## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the value of digital tomosynthesis in the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary lesions on chest radiography.

## Materials and Methods

Two-hundred twenty-eight patients (133 men, 95 women; mean age, 70.8 ± 11.1 years) with suspected pulmonary lesions after initial analysis of chest radiography underwent digital tomosynthesis. Two independent readers (with 3 and 20 years of experience) prospectively analyzed the chest radiographic and digital tomosynthesis images on a picture archiving and communication system workstation and proposed a diagnostic confidence score for each lesion (1 or 2 = definitely or probably extrapulmonary lesion or pseudolesion, 3 = indeterminate, 4 or 5 = probably or definitely pulmonary lesion). Chest computed tomography was the reference standard examination.

## Results

A total of 251 suspected pulmonary lesions were identified. In 71 patients, digital tomosynthesis and computed tomography did not confirm any lesion. In the remaining 157 patients, 180 lesions were identified, including 112 pulmonary and 68 extrapulmonary lesions. In 110 (reader 1) and 123 (reader 2) lesions, correct diagnoses were provided after analysis of the chest radiographs. All lesions were correctly classified after digital tomosynthesis except for 14 extrapulmonary lesions (both readers) that were misinterpreted as pulmonary and 10 (reader 1) and six (reader 2) pulmonary lesions that were misinterpreted as pleural. Digital radiography versus tomosynthesis differed in accuracy (reader 1, 43% vs 90%; reader 2, 49% vs 92%; _P_ < .05) and confidence by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (reader 1, 0.788 vs 0.944; reader 2, 0.840 vs 0.997; _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Digital tomosynthesis improved diagnostic accuracy and confidence in the diagnosis of suspected pulmonary lesions on chest radiography.

The detection and characterization of pulmonary lesions, particularly of pulmonary nodules, are challenging tasks in thoracic imaging because of their frequently small size and poor conspicuity within surrounding anatomic structures. Pulmonary lesions are often visible retrospectively when reviewing previous radiographic images of patients with known nodules , and computer-aided detection systems have been advocated to improve the diagnostic accuracy . Frequently, a radiologist reporting chest radiographic images identifies doubtful or equivocal findings that could be attributed both to pulmonary and extrapulmonary lesions or to pseudolesions due to different overlapping planes.

One successful method for improving the conspicuity of suspected pulmonary lesions is dual-energy radiography . Although this method reduces the visible distraction of overlying ribs, it is nonetheless limited in that it does not reduce the visual clutter from overlying soft tissues. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard for imaging pulmonary lesions, particularly pulmonary nodules , but it remains relatively expensive and delivers considerable radiation dose to patients. Therefore, most lung lesions are detected by conventional chest radiography, with CT being normally performed to verify or clarify the diagnosis. Frequently, CT is performed in patients without any pulmonary lesions or with pulmonary lesions that appear clearly benign after CT .
