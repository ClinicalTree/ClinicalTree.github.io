## Rationale and Objectives

Conventional mammographic image contrast is derived from x-ray absorption, resulting in breast structure visualization due to density gradients that attenuate radiation without distinction between transmitted, scattered, or refracted x-rays. Diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) allows for increased contrast with decreased radiation dose compared to conventional mammographic imaging because of monochromatic x-rays, its unique refraction-based contrast mechanism, and excellent scatter rejection. However, a lingering drawback to the clinical translation of DEI has been the requirement for synchrotron radiation.

## Materials and Methods

The authors' laboratory developed a DEI prototype (DEI-PR) using a readily available tungsten x-ray tube source and traditional DEI crystal optics, providing soft tissue images at 60 keV. Images of full-thickness human breast tissue specimens were acquired on synchrotron-based DEI (DEI-SR), DEI-PR, and digital mammographic systems. A panel of expert radiologists evaluated lesion feature visibility and correlation with pathology after receiving training on the interpretation of refraction contrast mammographic images.

## Results

For mammographic features (mass, calcification), no significant differences were detected between the DEI-SR and DEI-PR systems. Benign lesions were perceived as better seen by radiologists using the DEI-SR system than the DEI-PR system at the \[111\] reflectivity, with generalizations limited by small sample size. No significant differences between DEI-SR and DEI-PR were detected for any other lesion type (atypical, cancer) at either crystal reflectivity.

## Conclusions

Thus, except for benign lesion characterizations, the DEI-PR system's performance was roughly equivalent to that of the traditional DEI system, demonstrating a significant step toward clinical translation of this modality for breast cancer applications.

Cancer imparts distinct and measurable changes in breast tissue at the cellular level. In conventional, attenuation-based radiography, variations in the density of the breast tissue lead to varied x-ray attenuation and thus varied intensity in the image. Contrast based on the spatial distribution of x-ray attenuation is not always sufficient to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues. However, additional contrast can be gained from the refraction of x-rays. Microscopic and macroscopic alterations in the breast tissue may cause x-ray refraction, a minute change in the direction of x-ray propagation, which is exploited by phase-contrast imaging. X-ray refraction contrast is not yet widely used in medical imaging, although several phase-contrast imaging devices are in various stages of research and development .

Diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) is a specific type of analyzer-based phase-contrast imaging. Traditionally, DEI has used intense, highly collimated synchrotron radiation (SR) to produce images on the basis of absorption, refraction, and extinction contrast . The application of DEI to breast imaging has consistently provided a superior signal-to-noise ratio (contrast) compared to conventional radiographic images .
