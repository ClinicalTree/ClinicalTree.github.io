## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to identify clinically useful tumor/normal brain apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratios for distinguishing common pediatric cerebellar tumors.

## Materials and Methods

Review of medical records revealed 79 patients with cerebellar tumors who underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging sequences, and surgery. There were 31 pilocytic astrocytomas, 27 medulloblastomas, 14 ependymomas, and seven atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. ADC values were measured by placing regions of interest on the solid tumor and normal brain parenchyma by two reviewers. Tumor/normal brain ADC ratios were calculated.

## Results

Mean ADC values of the pilocytic astrocytomas were greater than those of ependymomas, whose mean ADC values were greater than those of medulloblastomas and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors. Using a tumor/normal brain ADC ratio threshold of 1.70 to distinguish pilocytic astrocytomas from ependymomas, sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 79% were achieved. A tumor/normal brain ADC ratio threshold of 1.20 enabled the sorting of ependymomas from medulloblastomas with sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 88%.

## Conclusions

Tumor/normal brain ADC ratios allow the distinguishing of common pediatric cerebellar tumors.

Central nervous system tumors are the most common solid neoplasms of childhood . Approximately half of pediatric central nervous system tumors are located in the posterior fossa . Unlike tumors of the supratentorial compartment, pediatric cerebellar tumors are easier to distinguish from one another because of their location, appearance, and spread pattern and the age of the patient at presentation. Several studies have shown that diffusion characteristics of the common pediatric cerebellar tumors may be helpful in rendering an accurate preoperative diagnosis . Medulloblastomas generally show lower apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), while pilocytic astrocytomas (PAs) display greater ADC values . There has been some debate on whether PAs may show lower ADC value than the normal brain parenchyma . In clinical practice, the reader generally contrasts the signal intensity of the tumor on diffusion-weighted images or on the ADC map against the normal brain parenchyma to determine the diffusion characteristics of the tumor. The objectives of our retrospective study were to investigate the ADC values and tumor/normal brain ADC ratios of common cerebellar tumors in a larger number of patients than previously published and to identify tumor/normal brain ADC ratio thresholds that may be useful in clinical practice.

## Materials and methods

## Patient Population

Review of the neuro-oncology database from January 2001 through May 2010 yielded 287 patients with neoplasms in the posterior fossa. Fifty-two patients (18.11%) with brain stem tumors were excluded. Relatively infrequent cerebellar tumors ( _n_ ≤ 5) were excluded. The details of the excluded 20 posterior fossa lesions (8.51%) are shown in  Table 1 . There were 95 PAs, 73 medulloblastomas, 30 ependymomas, and 17 atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs). Of these, the 79 patients (age range, 0.25–18.73 years; mean age, 5.90 years; 51 male) who had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, including a diffusion-weighted imaging sequence not hampered by magnetic susceptibility artifacts generated by dental hardware, and first surgery performed at our institution were included in this study. Pathologic diagnoses were made according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system . This study was reviewed and approved for assurances of patient safety and confidentiality by our institutional review board.
