## Rationale and Objectives

C-arm computed tomography is an option on a C-arm angiographic system capable of acquiring projections while rotating the C-arm around the patient and reconstructing cross-sectional images with improved contrast resolution of 5 to 10 Hounsfield units. Typical abdominal C-arm computed tomographic (CCT) images, however, exhibit artifacts with spatially varying and drifting pixel values. Considering liver tumor oncologic procedures, the aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of liver iodine concentration (IC) estimated from CCT images under such challenging conditions.

## Materials and Methods

The proposed method estimates the IC in a region of interest (ROI) using pixel values of CCT images measured at the ROI and a nonenhanced background. Two approaches to measure the background value were tested: one approach, L-BG, measured a corresponding local background value near each ROI, and the other, G-BG, used one global background value for the entire object. The accuracy of estimations using CCT and computed tomographic scanners was evaluated; an elliptical cylinder water phantom with iodine solution inserts and seven patient data sets with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization were used.

## Results

With the least “truncation” (the edge of the object being outside the field of view) of 27 mm, the IC was accurately estimated with CCT images ( _n_ = 9; root-mean-square error \[RMSE\], 1.60–1.63 mg/mL; normalized RMSE, 11.8%; _r_ 2 = 0.97; _P_ < .001), with the true concentration ranging from 2.32 to 31.82 mg/mL. With truncations of up to 100 mm ( _n_ = 88), the estimation by L-BG remained accurate independent of the amount of truncation (RMSE, 1.58 mg/mL; normalized RMSE, 12.5%; _r_ 2 = 0.06; _P_ = .02), whereas the estimation by G-BG reduced the accuracy (RMSE, 4.61 mg/mL; normalized RMSE, 34.3%; _r_ 2 = 0.10; _P_ = .003). Clinical data ( _n_ = 37) showed that the estimation from CCT images using the L-BG method agreed well with that from computed tomographic images (RMSE, 2.86 mg/mL; normalized RMSE, 38.7%; _r_ 2 = 0.76; _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

The liver IC can be accurately estimated with abdominal CCT images.

Many image-guided interventional procedures remain subjective, even with the introduction of digital flat-panel detectors. Many interventional procedures that use x-ray images involve iodine, for example, nonionized iodine contrast agent material ( ), iodine-mixed lipiodol oil for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) ( ), and embolic particles in an iodized solution ( ). Measuring the concentration of iodine, which is likely associated with drug concentration or blood perfusion, can lead to objective, evidence-driven procedures.

In organs, iodine is distributed three dimensionally ( ). Thus, two-dimensional projection images such as fluoroscopic or angiographic images, which show the total amount of iodine along each x-ray path, are not sufficient for accurately estimating iodine concentration (IC)—the amount of iodine per unit volume—and its spatial distribution ( ). Therefore, in this study, we used a recently developed C-arm computed tomographic (CCT) system ( ) to quantify the IC. CCT imaging is an option on C-arm angiographic systems that acquires projections while rotating the C-arm around the patient and reconstructs cross-sectional images with improved contrast resolution of 5 to 10 Hounsfield units ( ). There are two major challenges with abdominal CCT imaging: (1) to quantify the IC from a single scan and (2) to overcome the effect of artifacts unique to abdominal applications. Thus, we proposed combining two methods, each of which solves one problem. We focused on measuring the IC in the liver, because our primary clinical application was TACE for liver tumors. In principal, however, the method can be applied to other applications and organs.

where _w_ I and _w_ BG are the relative concentration in terms of a fraction by weight, ρ  I and ρ  BG are the native density (in grams per cubic centimeter), and μ  (ρ) I and μ  (ρ) BG are the mass attenuation coefficient (in square centimeters per gram) of iodine and background material, respectively. In a case in which there is only one substance (iodine) dissolved in the background material (water or tissue), the enhancement from the background due to the iodine is related to the linear attenuation coefficients of the ROI and background by

where the values for the mass density of iodine, water, and liver tissue, available in the literature (20,21), are 4.93, 1.00, and 1.06 g/cm  3 , respectively. The reference x-ray photon energies of CCT and CT scanners in our study were found to be 79.0 and 78.6 keV, respectively. The mass attenuation coefficients of iodine, water, and liver tissue for CCT images were 3.713, 0.185, and 0.183 cm  2 /g, respectively. The corresponding values for CT images were 3.795, 0.185, and 0.184 cm  2 /g. To obtain the relative concentration _w_ I , we use Equation  A3 , whereby μ _x_ and μ  BG are obtained from the values of appropriate image pixels.
