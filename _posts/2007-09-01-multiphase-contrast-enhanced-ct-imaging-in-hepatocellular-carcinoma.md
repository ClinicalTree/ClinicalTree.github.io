## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the correlation between enhancement parameters of multiphase contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and immunohistochemical activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptors, and CD34 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-seven patients underwent curative resection for HCC with no preoperative treatment. We defined several CT enhancement parameters by measuring attenuation values of tumor, liver parenchyma, and aorta. The stored tissue blocks were assayed for immunohistochemical activities of VEGF, two VEGF receptors (Flt-1, Flk-1), and CD34, which were correlated with the enhancement parameters of multiphase contrast-enhanced CT.

## Results

The VEGF activities in HCC showed moderate positive correlation with phase difference in portal phase, delayed enhancement (DE), tumor-blood ratio, blood pool index, and tumor-parenchyma ratio in arterial phase. The Flk-1 activities in HCC showed moderate positive correlation only with DE. CD34 activity in HCC showed positive correlation with most of the CT parameters except for DE.

## Conclusion

Our study showed that several CT enhancement parameters representing mainly delayed enhancement features were well correlated with VEGF activity in HCC, and might be valuable indicators for assessing angiogenic activity in HCC.

Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor growth and metastasis, and neovasculature facilitates shedding of tumor cells into surrounding blood vessels ( ). Growing tumors produce several angiogenic factors that stimulate endothelial cells and facilitate the formation of neovessels. Among the many angiogenic growth factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been recognized as one of the most potent and effective factors ( ). VEGF expression by tumors is closely related to tumor progression and prognosis and metastasis ( ). There are currently two well-known VEGF receptors: Flt-1 and Flk-1. Flt-1 is also called VEGFR-1, and Flk-1 is also called VEGFR-2 or KDR. The expression of VEGF receptor also correlates with vascularity, metastasis, and proliferative activities of tumors ( ). Thus it stands to reason that VEGF receptors must play a role in regulating VEGF functions in the cancer microenvironment.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumor characterized by its blood supply mainly from arterial sources ( ), and a high propensity for venous invasion. Expression of proangiogenic factors such as VEGF is known to be associated with the development of HCC ( ). CD34, a glycosylated transmembrane protein, is preferentially expressed on the surface of regenerating or migrating endothelial cells ( ), and has been investigated for localization of endothelial cells in HCC ( ). Several studies have suggested that CD34 may be a more sensitive and specific marker than other endothelial cell markers for microvessels in HCC ( ).
