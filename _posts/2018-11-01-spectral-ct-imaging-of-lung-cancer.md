## Rationale and Objectives

Spectral computed tomography (CT) imaging is widely used in the diagnosis of various cancers. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SC) and adenocarcinoma (AC) using spectral CT imaging.

## Methods

Sixty patients who were examined via spectral CT imaging and confirmed as having AC or SC via surgery and pathology were enrolled in this research project. A spectrum CT scanner was used, and both plain and enhanced CT scans were conducted to acquire spectral images. All patients' samples were used to detect the expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in cancer cells via immunohistochemical methods.

## Results

Among the 27 cases with AC, 18 cases were identified as TTF-1 positive, 9 cases were found to be TTF-1 negative, 20 cases were confirmed as EGFR positive, and 7 cases were found to be EGFR negative. Among the 33 patients with SC, 6 cases were identified as TTF-1 positive, 27 cases were found to be TTF-1 negative, 19 cases were confirmed as EGFR positive, and 14 cases were found to be EGFR negative. No statistically significant differences were observed in normalized iodine concentration (NIC), K values, and calcium content between the TTF-1-positive and TTF-1-negative groups when considering patients. Statistically significant differences in NIC and K values were noted between the EGFR-positive and EGFR-negative groups among patients with AC, but no such difference was observed regarding calcium content. Significant differences in NIC, K values, and calcium content were observed between the EGFR-positive and EGFR-negative groups among patients with SC.

## Conclusions

In lung cancer cells, the parameters of spectral CT imaging, including NIC and K values, reflect the microvessel density and blood supply. Calcium content is an indicator of the growth status of lung SC.

## Introduction

Currently, lung cancer is the most common malignancy and has the highest morbidity and mortality rates worldwide, and its incidence and mortality rate tend to increase with age . Given the increasing aging population, extensive attention has been focused on the increasing morbidity associated with lung cancer and the deaths caused by lung cancer. Certainly, smoking is the main cause of lung cancer, along with certain environmental factors, and rates of lung cancer differ distinctly based on age, sex, race, occupation, and geography . The heterogeneity and complexity of lung cancer are determined by genes that play crucial roles in its occurrence, type, development, and prognosis . According to the World Health Organization classification system for lung tumors, from a clinical standpoint, lung carcinomas are broadly divided into non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). NSCLC is usually classified into squamous cell carcinoma (SC), adenocarcinoma (AC), and large cell carcinoma . The SC is the most common type of lung cancer, and it is closely related to smoking .

Despite the various research projects that have been conducted and great medical progress, a cure for lung cancer is not an achievable goal at present . However, we can improve the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Immunohistochemical staining techniques can localize certain antigens in tissue through a specific antigen-antibody reaction , and these techniques can further differential diagnosis of tumors . Immunohistochemical staining techniques also play an important role in the histologic classification of tumors and their pathologic analysis, as well as in the choice of clinical treatment and the determination of operation scope . Immunohistochemical detection is highly accurate in the diagnosis of lung cancer, and its role has been widely recognized. Spectral computed tomography (CT) imaging systems are frequently used as a diagnostic tool in various cancers because of their tremendous applications and advantages . The density of materials and images at different levels of kiloelectron volts (keV) can be obtained from the spectral CT imaging. Spectral CT imaging is also capable of displaying the x-ray attenuation coefficient changed with the x-ray energy, at different lesions and tissues, offering valuable insights into the elemental composition of tissue and paving the way for novel CT contrast agents by detecting element-specific patterns . Moreover, spectral CT imaging is used to create spectral analysis graphs and spectral attenuation curves for lesions and to carry out multiparameter quantitative analysis, which may reflect the histologic characteristics of a lesion to a certain extent .
