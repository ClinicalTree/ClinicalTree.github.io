Christopher G. Roth, MD, an assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, has created an accessible guide to interpreting body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiology trainees and practicing radiologists alike. The text manages to be thorough, yet remarkably concise.

_Fundamentals of Body MRI_ is part of Saunders Elsevier's Fundamentals of Radiology series. Readers familiar with that series will find this text to be consistent with the generally high quality of the other offerings in the _Fundamentals_ line. The book begins with a welcome and well-executed discussion of MRI physics. Wisely, Roth eschews abstract esoterica and complicated mathematics in favor of a simple and liberally illustrated discussion of the most fundamental concepts. Throughout the book, the reader will find detailed information on protocols, hardware, and imaging artifacts.

Among the clinical topics covered in this book include imaging of the liver, the pancreaticobiliary system, the kidneys and adrenal glands, the retroperitoneum (as a subsection in the renal/adrenal chapter), and the female pelvis. Cardiovascular and breast MRI are (appropriately) not within the scope of this book. A curious omission is the topic of prostate MRI, which would have been of interest to this reviewer. For each chapter, key concepts are introduced then motivated with sufficient detail to impart a high level of understanding of the subject matter. Anatomic illustrations and diagnostic images are plentiful, high-quality, and accompanied by instructive legends. The chapter on female pelvic MRI is particularly high yield and alone is worth the price of the book.

Access to the  expertconsult.com website is included with each copy of the book via a scratch code on the inside cover. Registered users are can access a searchable, online version of the entire text including all images. Finally, most bibliographical references include hyperlinks to the relevant PubMed abstracts.

The subject matter likely is too advanced for most medical students. However, trainees and nonsubspecialist attendings alike will find _Fundamentals of Body MRI_ to be an excellent primer. Body imagers could possibly benefit from having a copy as a quick refresher, although the book makes no pretense of serving as a definitive reference. Rather, the concise format is designed for succinct review, while the thorough bibliography is perfect for guiding further studies. In all, this book is an excellent value and a worthy read.
