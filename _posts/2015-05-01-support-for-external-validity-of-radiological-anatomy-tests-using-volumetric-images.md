## Rationale and Objectives

Radiology practice has become increasingly based on volumetric images (VIs), but tests in medical education still mainly involve two-dimensional (2D) images. We created a novel, digital, VI test and hypothesized that scores on this test would better reflect radiological anatomy skills than scores on a traditional 2D image test. To evaluate external validity we correlated VI and 2D image test scores with anatomy cadaver–based test scores.

## Materials and Methods

In 2012, 246 medical students completed one of two comparable versions (A and B) of a digital radiology test, each containing 20 2D image and 20 VI questions. Thirty-three of these participants also took a human cadaver anatomy test. Mean scores and reliabilities of the 2D image and VI subtests were compared and correlated with human cadaver anatomy test scores. Participants received a questionnaire about perceived representativeness and difficulty of the radiology test.

## Results

Human cadaver test scores were not correlated with 2D image scores, but significantly correlated with VI scores ( _r_ = 0.44, _P_ < .05). Cronbach's α reliability was 0.49 (A) and 0.65 (B) for the 2D image subtests and 0.65 (A) and 0.71 (B) for VI subtests. Mean VI scores (74.4%, standard deviation 2.9) were significantly lower than 2D image scores (83.8%, standard deviation 2.4) in version A ( _P_ < .001). VI questions were considered more representative of clinical practice and education than 2D image questions and less difficult (both _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

VI tests show higher reliability, a significant correlation with human cadaver test scores, and are considered more representative for clinical practice than tests with 2D images.

Radiologists and other medical specialists involved in interpreting radiological images are confronted with large datasets and ample options for image manipulation . Although radiologists used to view cross-sectional images as single slices presented next to each other (ie, tile viewing), nowadays, the use of innovative image displaying software is the norm. This allows the radiologist to scroll through three-dimensional (3D) datasets (stack viewing), adjust window level, and use advanced image reconstruction tools, such as on the fly multiplanar reformatting. The data for one cross-sectional patient investigation involve a volumetric image (VI) containing up to hundreds of slices, which can be scrolled through in various planes and contrast settings. A vast amount of visual information must be processed and interpreted by the observer . Radiological image interpretation has changed significantly and consequently requires different skills . It is therefore important that radiology education should change accordingly .

Acquiring basic radiological knowledge and image interpretation skills for medical students is increasingly important, as diagnostic imaging has become a prominent diagnostic tool in daily clinical practice . Specifically, the knowledge of radiological anatomy is required for medical doctors of various specialisms to recognize abnormalities on radiological images and to understand the radiology report . Efforts are made to innovate and digitalize radiology education; however, the contents of these curricula vary and are often not supported by empirical evidence . In particular, studies on the development of high quality radiology tests are scarce. Furthermore, most radiology tests do not do justice to the major developments in radiological image interpretation practice. For example, most radiology tests or self-assessment tools do not contain VIs or allow for image manipulation (2D image test) . Pass or fail decisions in traditional radiology tests might therefore become increasingly meaningless given they may reflect measures of irrelevant competence. High quality radiology tests are consequently essential to ensure adequate levels of radiological performance among medical doctors.
