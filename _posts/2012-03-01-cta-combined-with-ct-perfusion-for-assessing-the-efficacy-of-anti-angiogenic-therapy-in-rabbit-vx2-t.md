## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to validate the feasibility of assessing the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy on VX2 tumors using three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) combined with CT perfusion.

## Materials and Methods

Forty rabbits with VX2 tumors were randomly assigned to four groups according to different doses of antiangiogenic drug, which were administered intraperitoneally daily for 14 days. In each group, 10 animals were scanned using three-dimensional CTA and CT perfusion on days 1 and 2 after the latest administration of the drug. Tumor masses were sectioned, stained by immunohistochemistry, and processed for correlation between CT imaging and histology.

## Results

The numbers of new tumor vessels from CTA were significantly different among the four groups ( _P_ < .001). As the dose of the drug increased, blood flow and blood volume on CT perfusion increased linearly, but the mean transit time and permeability surface-area product decreased linearly ( _P_ < .001). Immunohistochemical analyses showed that microvascular density decreased, while both luminal vascular number and mature vessel number increased linearly as the drug dose increased ( _P_ < .001). CT manifestations were correlated well with histologic findings ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

It is feasible to assess the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy on VX2 tumors using three-dimensional CTA combined with CT perfusion. Three-dimensional CTA can display the morphologic changes of tumor vessels, while CT perfusion can predict the functional changes of tumor vessels after antiangiogenic therapy.

Neovascularization is an essential process for the growth, invasion, and metastasis of solid tumors . Antiangiogenic therapy represents a promising strategy for tumor therapy. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie angiogenesis has advanced significantly over the past decade, leading to the development of a number of new drugs that inhibit angiogenesis .

These forms of antiangiogenic therapies have created a need for efficient, noninvasive, and reliable ways to monitor tumor angiogenesis and to assess the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy. Microvascular density (MVD), particularly measured in the most neovascular area (the “hot spot”) of a tumor, is currently an ideal histologic method in assessing the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy . However, the measurement of MVD is not pragmatic in clinical practice, because of its invasiveness and the inconvenience of obtaining tumor tissues with repeated tumor biopsies.
