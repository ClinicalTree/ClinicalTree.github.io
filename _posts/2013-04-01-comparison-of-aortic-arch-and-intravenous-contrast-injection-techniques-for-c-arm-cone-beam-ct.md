## Rationale and Objectives

The ability to perform cerebral perfusion imaging (CPI) in the angiography suite has provided a new tool for diagnosis and treatment of neurovascular patients but requires comparable contrast perfusion to each cerebral hemisphere. In the angiography suite, contrast injection may be performed via an intra-arterial or intravenous (IV) route. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a difference exists between contrast injection in the aortic arch (AA) and a peripheral vein (IV), particularly in the setting of stroke.

## Materials and Methods

Using three canines, both AA and IV injection protocols compatible with CPI were performed prospectively at three time points after creation of a stroke. The common carotid arteries in the resulting image data sets were segmented and the means and distributions of corresponding pixel intensities analyzed with Student's _t_ -test. Using similar techniques, the internal carotid arteries of three patients (one female, two males, ages 69, 29, and 20) undergoing AA contrast injection with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) cerebral imaging were analyzed and compared retrospectively with those of three random patients (one female, two males, ages 19, 57, and 35) undergoing standard head CT scans using IV contrast administration. All acquisitions followed institutionally approved protocols and informed consent.

## Results

No statistical significance ( _P_ < .05) was found when mean values for the right and left carotid artery pixel intensities were compared in the canine model or the clinical studies in which patients underwent imaging after AA or IV contrast administration.

## Conclusions

No statistically significant difference exists between right and left carotid artery filling density using either AA or IV contrast injection methods, making both suitable for CPI in the angiography suite.

Conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) highlights abnormalities in vascular anatomy that may be pathologic, whereas advances in technology and medical knowledge have led to the development of imaging techniques that yield clinically useful physiologic information . Examples of the latter include positron emission tomography, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and perfusion computed tomography (CT). In cerebral perfusion imaging (CPI), measurements of cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and cerebral blood flow (CBF) make up parameters used to describe the physiologic tissue perfusion of the brain. Such information is very helpful in assessing patients suffering acute stroke, vasospasm, and intracranial tumors . In fact, perfusion CT and perfusion MRI techniques are being considered as tools to extend the window for thrombolysis in acute stroke .

There exist several endovascular treatment options for acute stroke in the angiography suite, including intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis and mechanical embolectomy . With these treatment methods available in the angiography suite and the strong inverse correlation between time to treatment and good outcomes, clearly it would be advantageous to have the multimodal imaging capabilities for stroke work up in the same room where therapy can take place. With the advent of Food and Drug Administration–approved C-arm-mounted flat-panel detectors in angiography suites (Artis zee biplane, Siemens Healthcare, Germany), the ability to acquire three-dimensional cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images in addition to traditional angiographic images from standard C-arm systems inside the angiography suite is now being incorporated into routine angiography protocols . These systems are capable of producing CBV maps in ischemic stroke models comparable to conventional perfusion CT and, with some alterations to image acquisition protocols, are even able to provide comparable temporal MTT and CBF information .
