## Rationale and Objectives

The newly formed Alliance of Directors and Vice Chairs of Education in Radiology (ADVICER), a group within the Alliance for Clinician Educators in Radiology, identified an acute need for a generic job description template for Vice Chairs of Education in Radiology, a role that is being developed in many academic Departments of Radiology. Eighty-three percent of current members who responded to a survey had no detailed job description, and over half had no job description at all. Having a comprehensive and detailed job description is vital to developing this key position.

## Materials and Methods

Using the results of a survey sent to ADVICER members and seven Education Vice Chair job descriptions provided by members, the authors developed a detailed job description encompassing all potential elements of this position.

## Results

Only 17% of survey respondents had a detailed job description. The role of an Education Vice Chair varies significantly between institutions in its scope and level of responsibilities. The resultant generic job description that was devised is intended to provide a template that would be modified by the candidate or the Department Chair. It is unlikely that any one individual would perform all the described activities.

## Conclusions

ADVICER has developed a comprehensive, flexible job description for Vice Chair of Education in Radiology that can be adapted by institutions as appropriate. It can be downloaded from  http://aur.org/ADVICER/ .

Education within an academic medical department includes many interrelated activities and learner groups. An evidence-based approach to leadership in education requires highly skilled faculty who are well trained in their specialty and have excellent interpersonal and collaborative skills to integrate both undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education curricula . In a survey of surgeons, the skills deemed to be of greatest importance for these faculty were the ability to communicate effectively, the ability to resolve personnel conflicts, and the ability to introduce change .

The challenges facing academic faculty are complex and include limited financing and increasing expectations from hospitals and accreditation boards for accountability . As a result, many medical specialties have established the position of Education Vice Chair (or Director of Education) to oversee education in their departments. However, the position of Education Vice Chair is often vague, and roles and responsibilities are poorly defined . For example, in a 2010 survey sent to Department of Medicine Vice Chairs for Education, only 17% of respondents had a defined job description and metrics to evaluate their success .
