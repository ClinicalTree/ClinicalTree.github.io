## Rationale and Objectives

Evaluation of nodal involvement in early-stage breast cancers (T1 or T2) changed following the Z11 trial; however, not all patients meet the Z11 inclusion criteria. Hence, the relevance of ultrasound imaging of the axilla and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) in early-stage breast cancers was investigated.

## Materials and Methods

In this single-center, retrospective study, 758 subjects had pathology-verified breast cancer diagnosis over a 3-year period, of which 128 subjects with T1 or T2 breast tumors had abnormal axillary lymph nodes on ultrasound, had FNA, and proceeded to axillary surgery. Ultrasound images were reviewed and analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify the features predictive of positive FNA. Accuracy of FNA was quantified as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with axillary surgery as reference standard.

## Results

Of 128 subjects, 61 were positive on FNA and 65 were positive on axillary surgery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FNA were 52 of 65 (80%), 54 of 63 (85.7%), 52 of 61(85.2%), and 54 of 67 (80.5%), respectively. After adjusting for neoadjuvant chemotherapy between FNA and surgery, a positive FNA was associated with higher likelihood for positive axillary surgery (odds ratio: 22.7; 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 7.2–71.3, _P_ < .0001), and the accuracy of FNA was 0.801 (95% CI: 0.727–0.876). Among ultrasound imaging features, cortical thickness and abnormal hilum were predictive ( _P_ < .017) of positive FNA with accuracy of 0.817 (95% CI: 0.741–0.893).

## Conclusions

Ultrasound imaging and FNA can play an important role in the management of early breast cancers even in the post-Z11 era. Higher weightage can be accorded to cortical thickness and hilum during ultrasound evaluation.

## Introduction

Management of breast cancer has been evolving over the last few decades. Less invasive procedures with lower morbidity have been shown to be equally effective with no adverse impact on outcomes . Metastatic involvement of the axilla is an important prognostic indicator on the outcome in patients with breast cancer. In stage I-II breast cancers, tumor grade, size, receptor status, and lymphovascular invasion of the tumor increase the odds for involvement of the axilla . The imaging modality of choice for evaluation of the axilla is ultrasound (US). When suspicious lymph nodes are identified on US, fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) or core-needle biopsy typically follows, both to establish a histological diagnosis and to guide further management. A number of studies have outlined the benefits of US and FNA in the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes .

The publication of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z11 trial, however, resulted in a paradigm shift in the way early T1 and T2 breast cancers are managed at most institutions . The study showed no benefit for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) over surgical sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for patients with low burden of axillary disease who underwent breast conserving therapy and received whole breast irradiation. It established SNB as the standard of care . As a consequence, the value of imaging and interventional procedures of axillary lymph nodes has been questioned . To remain relevant and continue to contribute meaningfully to patient care, it is important for breast imagers to adapt to these changes.

Some of the subjects underwent interim neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) between the time of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) and the surgical procedure, and was included in the model. Hence, the results are presented for the cohort of subjects who did not undergo NCT, and for the entire study sample that includes subjects who underwent NCT.
