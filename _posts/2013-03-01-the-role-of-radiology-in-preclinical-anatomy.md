## Rationale and Objectives

Radiology has been an increasingly important component of preclinical anatomy instruction since the 1960s. The global status of medical imaging pedagogies and radiologists' roles in medical anatomy education is not well established but is important in determining the specialty's contribution to undergraduate medical education.

## Materials and Methods

PubMed was searched with various combinations of MeSH terms including “radiology,” “undergraduate medical education,” and “anatomy.” Articles were reviewed for relevance, and referenced articles of possible relevance were hand-traced to ensure a wide capture of articles.

## Results

Although more medical schools around the world are using medical imaging to teach anatomy, some regions, such as the United States, show a decline in the proportion of imaging taught by radiologists. Lectures, small group discussions, and self-instruction remain the mainstay of current pedagogies and have witnessed dramatic changes over the past few decades with respect to the types of imaging used. Newer pedagogies use contextual and hands-on experiences to improve spatial and application principles. Qualitative and quantitative studies report somewhat mixed results of pedagogical efficacies but demonstrate generally high acceptance by students and instructors and often significant exam score improvement. Radiology as a specialty must overcome several challenges for it to become more involved in anatomy education, including teaching incentives and protected academic time.

## Conclusions

As anatomy instruction and clinical medicine grow increasingly digital, it is ever more important that radiologists continue to develop new anatomy pedagogies and contribute to anatomy education in greater roles.

Anatomical knowledge is generally regarded as a cornerstone of undergraduate medical education . New instructional methods for anatomy are being developed in response to new national guidelines , concerns of inadequate anatomy retention in house staff , and improved technology . Radiological teaching interventions in medical anatomy courses have been a central part of curricular development since the late 1960s and have grown considerably in use and complexity .

The changing role of radiologists in preclinical anatomy education is critical to the development of future physicians in all medical fields as the number of anatomist course directors decreases, less course time is devoted to human anatomy, and medical imaging is increasingly used in almost every specialty . This article critically reviews the presence of medical imaging and radiologists in medical anatomy education.
