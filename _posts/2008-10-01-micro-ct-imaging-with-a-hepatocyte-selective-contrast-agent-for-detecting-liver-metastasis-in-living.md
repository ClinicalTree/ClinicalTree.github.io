## Rationale and Objectives

Micro-computed tomography (CT) is a important tool for longitudinal imaging of tumor development. The detection and monitoring of tumors in the liver in live animals using micro-CT is challenging. We evaluated the feasibility of high-resolution micro-CT enhanced with a hepatocyte-selective contrast agent for detecting liver metastases in a live murine model.

## Materials and Methods

Hepatic metastases were induced in 10 BALB/C mice. Two mice each were randomly selected on days 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13 after CT26 colon adenocarcinoma cells were injected into the portal vein; micro-CT imaging was performed at 10 minutes and 4 hours after intravenous administration of a hepatocyte-selective contrast agent at a dose of 0.4 mL/mouse. The attenuation values of the normal liver and the tumors were obtained. The number of metastases was counted and their sizes were measured on the micro-CT images. Gross or histopathologic evaluation was performed for correlating the liver tumors with the micro-CT images.

## Results

A total of 74 separate tumor sites larger than 300 μm in diameter were detected on pathologic examination of the mice that were sacrificed 7 days after cell injection. On micro-CT, 66 of 74 tumors were detected (83.8%). The smallest tumor detected on micro-CT was 300 μm. There were eight false-negative readings on micro-CT. The sizes of the individual liver metastases measured by micro-CT and on the excised specimen were highly correlated ( _P_ < .001). The correlation between the CT scan measurement and the actual measurement was _r_ = 0.8354 ( _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

High-resolution micro-CT enhanced with a hepatocyte-selective contrast agent can be a promising tool for detecting liver metastases in a live murine model.

The liver is a common site of metastases from various primary tumors, and so it is an important area of metastasis research ( ). Rodent models that mimic the development of metastatic disease in the human liver are increasingly being recognized as powerful tools for the development of anticancer drugs and for evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutics in the preclinical setting ( ). Noninvasive longitudinal imaging of rodent models would decrease experimental variability and provide a more accurate assessment of metastatic progression and the efficacy of therapeutic interventions ( ). Several longitudinal imaging modalities are now used, including magnetic resonance imaging, x-ray computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography, and fluorescent and bioluminescent imaging.

Micro-CT has been applied in biomedical research mainly for studying bones and lung disease, for which the natural contrast between bone and air and the surrounding soft tissues are provided ( ). Micro-CT increased the spatial resolution noninvasively and it allowed very high precision for localization of bony changes. It has been proposed by some researchers that small-animal x-ray CT is an important tool for longitudinal imaging of tumor development, for visualizing blood vessels and angiogenesis, and for following the response of tumors to preclinical therapeutic intervention ( ). However, the detection and monitoring of tumor in the liver in live animals using micro-CT is still challenging because of the poor natural contrast between the tumor and the liver parenchyma. When performing micro-CT imaging for the liver of small animals, it is not possible to use the conventional water-soluble contrast agents that are used in humans because they clear rapidly from the blood.
