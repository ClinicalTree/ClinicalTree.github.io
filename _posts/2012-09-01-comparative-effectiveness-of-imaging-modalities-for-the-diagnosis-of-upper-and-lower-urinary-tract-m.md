## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to critically appraise and compare the diagnostic performance of imaging modalities that are used for the diagnosis of upper and lower/bladder urinary tract cancer, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC).

## Methods

A focused clinical question was constructed and the literature was searched using the patient, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) method comparing computed tomography (CT) urography, magnetic resonance (MR) urography, excretory urography, and retrograde urography in the detection of TCC of the upper urinary tract. The same methods were used to compare CT cystography, MR cystography, and ultrasonography in the diagnosis of bladder cancer. Retrieved articles were appraised and assigned a level of evidence based on the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine hierarchy of validity for diagnostic studies.

## Results

The retrieved sensitivity/specificity for the detection of TCC of upper urinary tract for CT urography, MR urography, excretory urography, and retrograde urography were 96%/99%, 69%/97%, 80%/81%, and 96%/96%, respectively. For detecting bladder cancer, the retrieved sensitivity/specificity for CT cystography, MR cystography, and ultrasonography were 94%/98%, 91%/95%, and 78%/96%, respectively.

## Conclusions

CT urography is the best imaging technique for confirming or excluding malignancy in the upper urinary tract, whereas CT cystography has the best diagnostic performance for diagnosing bladder cancer.

Transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter account for 7% of kidney tumors and 4% of upper urinary tract tumors, respectively . This cancer has a greater than 90% cure rate if superficial and confined to the renal pelvis and ureter . For more invasive tumors, the cure rate drops to 10%–15% . Current standard diagnostic modalities for evaluation of upper urinary tract malignancy include computed tomography urography (CTU) or excretory urography. If the patient has a contraindication to intravenous iodinated contrast media, retrograde urography or gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance urography (MRU) are alternative options .

Bladder cancer will account for an estimated 73,510 new cases and 14,880 deaths in the United States in 2012 . Cystoscopy is the gold standard of diagnosing bladder cancer; however, it is an invasive technique . CT cystography (CTC) and MR cystography (MRC) are less invasive new modalities that have been proposed in the assessment of bladder cancer .
