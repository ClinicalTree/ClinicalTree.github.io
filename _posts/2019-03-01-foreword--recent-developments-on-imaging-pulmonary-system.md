A variety of imaging techniques have been utilized to study and further understand the pulmonary system over the past few decades. Researchers have refined and optimized techniques across a range of imaging modalities to generate structural, functional, and metabolic information, with the ultimate goal of translation into the clinical realm. This data becomes particularly useful when used to develop biomarkers for disease pathology or to understand physiological mechanisms of these diseases.

Traditionally, radiologists and clinicians have relied primarily on computed tomography (CT) to gain a better understanding of pulmonary diseases. Yet the cost and need for ionizing radiation have limited the use of CT. When used in conjunction with different modalities–including single-photon emission computed tomography, positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance (MR), hyperpolarized gas MR, hyperpolarized  13 C MR – clinicians and researchers can generate a more comprehensive understanding of pulmonary function.

In the past several years, hyperpolarized gas MR studies in particular have advanced beyond the initial feasibility stage and developed into thorough investigations obtaining detailed quantitative information regarding gas mechanics, lung microstructure, and metabolism. Combining complementary material from various imaging modalities can help to pathogenically and quantitatively characterize a variety of lung disorders.

The articles in this special issue highlight the progress made in understanding these pulmonary diseases and conditions–either by improving imaging sequences and techniques directly, building upon reconstruction methods, developing new perfusion techniques, or combining modalities. This work promises great potential in translation to the clinical world, in particular, the staging and diagnoses of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis.

This series of papers represents some of the most significant advancements made in applying biomedical imaging technology to the understanding of such diseases today. They draw from the strengths of a range of techniques and methodologies, generating complementary measurements and observations that together provide a comprehensive understanding of lung function and physiology.

While CT used alone may be limited in scope, researchers can utilize innovative analysis tools to extract useful information from CT images. Han et al. used voxel-wise parametric response mapping to study changes in disease progression in smokers. This study imaged smokers both with and without COPD and compared changes in lung density between matched inspiratory and expiratory CT images taken 5 years apart from each other. Conducting parametric response mapping analysis on these images can differentiate between normal lung parenchyma, nonemphysematous air-trapping, and emphysema. This study confirmed small airway disease as a radiographic precursor to emphysema, a finding suggested by previous studies. Early diagnosis of emphysema can be critical in preventing further complications, such as functional decline, lung cancer, and respiratory exacerbations.
