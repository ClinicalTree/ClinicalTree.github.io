## Rationale and Objectives

Head circumference (HC) is an important developmental measure used both clinically and in research. This paper advances a method to estimate HC from imaging studies when a direct HC-tape measurement cannot be secured. Unlike former approaches, the model takes into account the fact that growth is nonlinear, and that HC growth rates are sexually dimorphic.

## Materials and Methods

A model was first established based on published data to represent the normative HC growth curves for males and females. Then, using magnetic resonance (MR) studies of 90 subjects (birth to 18 years), a linear method to estimate HC was adapted to take into account the nonlinear and sex-specific HC normative growth curves. The accuracy of this model was tested prospectively by comparing the estimated HC with HC measurements from twelve computed tomography (CT) studies using the perimeter tracing of oblique slices that correspond to the plane at which a clinical HC-tape measurement is secured.

## Results

Prospective comparison of estimated HC to HC tracings using a paired t-test validates that the model provides an accurate estimation of the measured HC (t=−.845, p=0.416 overall; t=.54, p=.615 for females and t=−2.34, p=.066 for males).

## Discussion

HC can be calculated indirectly from imaging studies. The model is highly predictive of HC-tape measurements and provides the physician or scientist with a very reliable method to secure HC when it is not feasible to secure the HC-tape measurement.

## Introduction

Measurements of head size, both prenatally and postnatally, are medically important to assess the growth of the cranium. The typical prenatal ultrasound measurement is based on biparietal (BP) diameter or head circumference (HC) tracing ( ). The conventional postnatal clinical method, which is reportedly a highly reliable measurement ( ), is to secure a direct HC measurement by applying a measuring tape around the frontal forehead and occiput (HC-tape). HC-tape measurement is typically not secured clinically after age 2 and is therefore not always a readily available measurement to secure retrospectively for medical or research purposes. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to estimate HC from imaging studies when a direct HC-tape measurement or HC tracing cannot be secured.

There are only a few studies that report on HC measurement throughout the developmental age range, _i.e._ , approximately the first two decades of life (  Table 1 ) ( ). The HC measurements reported by Nellhaus ) span the entire developmental age range and are used as the normative standard in most specialty clinics ( ). HC follows the neural growth curve, as defined by Scammon; by age 6 years HC has reached 80 % of its adult size, but continues to increase at a more gradual rate until about age 18 ( ) (  Figure 1 ).
