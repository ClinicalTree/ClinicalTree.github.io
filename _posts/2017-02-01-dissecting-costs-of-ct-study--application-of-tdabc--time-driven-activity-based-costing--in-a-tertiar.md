## Rationale and Objectives

The lack of understanding of the real costs (not charge) of delivering healthcare services poses tremendous challenges in the containment of healthcare costs. In this study, we applied an established cost accounting method, the time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC), to assess the costs of performing an abdomen and pelvis computed tomography (AP CT) in an academic radiology department and identified opportunities for improved efficiency in the delivery of this service.

## Materials and Methods

The study was exempt from an institutional review board approval. TDABC utilizes process mapping tools from industrial engineering and activity-based costing. The process map outlines every step of discrete activity and duration of use of clinical resources, personnel, and equipment. By multiplying the cost per unit of capacity by the required task time for each step, and summing each component cost, the overall costs of AP CT is determined for patients in three settings, inpatient (IP), outpatient (OP), and emergency departments (ED).

## Results

The component costs to deliver an AP CT study were as follows: radiologist interpretation: 40.1%; other personnel (scheduler, technologist, nurse, pharmacist, and transporter): 39.6%; materials: 13.9%; and space and equipment: 6.4%. The cost of performing CT was 13% higher for ED patients and 31% higher for inpatients (IP), as compared to that for OP. The difference in cost was mostly due to non-radiologist personnel costs.

## Conclusions

Approximately 80% of the direct costs of AP CT to the academic medical center are related to labor. Potential opportunities to reduce the costs include increasing the efficiency of utilization of CT, substituting lower cost resources when appropriate, and streamlining the ordering system to clarify medical necessity and clinical indications.

## Introduction

The growing pressure to reduce the overall healthcare expenditure and to improve coordination of care has led to transformation of the Medicare payment model. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced the goal that 30% of Medicare payments are tied to alternative payment models by the end of 2016 and 50% by the end of 2018 . This value-based payment models reward quality and value of care over quantity of services, clearly shifting from the traditional fee-for-service model . Bundled payment, one approach of alternative payment models, facilitates improved coordination and integration of care and holds the provider team accountable for the full cycle of care to achieve better outcomes .

The healthcare expense of medical imaging has dramatically increased over the past several decades . Most of the growth in imaging expenditures has been driven by increased utilization of advanced imaging, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET). Efforts to reduce healthcare costs have had impact on the reduction of imaging-related expense. For example, from 2009 to 2010, the imaging volume among Medicare beneficiaries declined by 3.5% . Nevertheless, as of June 2012, medical imaging remains 11.9% of the total Medicare charges (MedPAC Report on March 2014;  www.medpac.gov ).
