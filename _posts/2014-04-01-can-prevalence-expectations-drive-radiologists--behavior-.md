## Rationale and Objectives

To measure the effect of explicit prevalence expectation on the performance of experienced radiologists during image interpretation of pulmonary lesions on chest radiographs.

## Materials and Methods

Each of 22 experienced radiologists was allocated to one of three groups to interpret a set of 30 (15 abnormal) posteroanterior chest images on two occasions to decide if pulmonary lesions were present. Before each viewing, the radiologists were told that the images contained a specific number of abnormal images: group 1, 9 versus 15; group 2, 22 versus 15; and group 3, not told versus 15, respectively. Eye position metrics and receiver operating characteristics confidence ratings were compared for normal and abnormal images. An analysis of false-positive and false-negative decisions was also performed.

## Results

For normal images, at higher prevalence expectation, significant increases were noted for duration of image scrutiny (group 1: _P_ = .0004; group 2: _P_ = .007; and group 3: _P_ = .003) and number of fixations per image (group 1: _P_ = .0006; group 2: _P_ = .0004; and group 3: _P_ = .0001). Also for normal images, group 1 demonstrated a significant increase ( _P_ = .038) in average confidence ratings when prevalence expectation increased. For abnormal images, at higher prevalence expectation, significant increases were noted for duration of image scrutiny in group 1 ( _P_ = .005) and number of fixations per image in group 1 ( _P_ = .01) and group 2 ( _P_ = .003).

## Conclusions

Confidence ratings and visual search of the expert radiologists appear to be affected by changing prevalence expectations. The impact of prevalence expectation appears to be more apparent for normal images.

It has been acknowledged that the effects of prevalence on radiologists' behavior are not well understood . The prevalence phenomenon is reported to alter radiologists' behavior and this may be because of the actual differences in prevalence levels or in the expectation of the prevalence level (even when the actual normal-to-abnormal ratio remains constant). However, the mechanisms responsible for this change in radiologist behavior remain unknown.

Previous studies on the impact of prevalence on radiologic _performance_ have provided various conclusions with one study suggesting that varying prevalence was unlikely to alter the accuracy of the observers , another demonstrating increased diagnostic efficacy with increasing prevalence , and another showing no significant effect . Also, the impact on radiologic confidence of prevalence remains unclear with previous studies presenting conflicting results . The first article established that observers tend to increase their confidence ratings with increasing prevalence , whereas a later article suggested that observers tend to decrease their confidence ratings with increasing prevalence . With such discrepancy, it is surprising that a greater emphasis has not been placed on understanding the impact of this phenomenon on radiologists' _behavior_ , particularly because the issue of prevalence is present every time a radiologist enters and is in a reading room. However, it is important to note that these previous studies focused on actual prevalence changes to the image test set rather than only altering the stated prevalence expectation to the radiologists before the reading session begins. To initiate this type of research into prevalence and radiologic behavior, a recent article, although showing no significant impact on reporting accuracy using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, did show that visual search in terms of interpretation time and the number of visual fixations was significantly changed when higher prevalence was told to be expected . This preliminary study, however, did not investigate other important behavioral issues, such as levels of confidence and the impact of prevalence expectation, on types of radiologic error. Also, although it is a reasonable assumption that increased prevalence expectation could affect quite different visual interactions with abnormal images compared to normal images; the previous study combined all images together as a single group.
