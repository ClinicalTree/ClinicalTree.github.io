## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the nature of the satisfaction of search (SOS) effect in chest radiography when observers are fatigued; determine if we could replicate recent findings that have documented the nature of the SOS effect to be due to a threshold shift rather than a change in diagnostic accuracy as in earlier film-based studies.

## Materials and Methods

Nearing or at the end of a clinical workday, 20 radiologists read 64 chest images twice, once with and once without the addition of a simulated pulmonary nodule. Half of the images had different types of “test” abnormalities. Decision thresholds were analyzed using the center of the range of false-positive (FP) and true-positive (TP) fractions associated with each receiver operating characteristic (ROC) point for reporting test abnormalities. Detection accuracy was assessed with ROC technique and inspection time was recorded.

## Results

The SOS effect was confirmed to be a reduction in willingness to respond (threshold shift). The center of the FP range was significantly reduced (FP = 0.10 without added nodules, FP = 0.05 with added nodules, F(1,18) = 19.85, _P_ = 0.0003). The center of the TP range was significantly reduced (TP = 0.39 without added nodules, TP = 0.33 with added nodules, F(1,18) = 10.81, _P_ = 0.004).

## Conclusions

This study suggests that fatigue does not change the nature of the SOS effect, but rather may be additive with the SOS effect. SOS reduces both TP and FP responses, whereas fatigue reduces TPs more than FPs.

## Introduction

In recent years, there has been concern over the impact of errors and fatigue on performance in medicine in general and for radiology in particular . Increased volumes of imaging studies that are more complex in nature have led to increased workloads and longer hours interpreting cases . Fatigue has both mental and physical consequences, can occur with or without feelings of sleepiness, and can be measured in a variety of subjective and objective ways (see Reference for a recent review). The effects of fatigue can vary as a function of task, level of experience, environmental conditions, and health status. For radiologists, visual fatigue and eye strain may be of particular interest given the visual nature of medical image interpretation. Cognitive fatigue may be important as well but has not been studied systematically in radiology.

Physical measures of visual strain (accommodation and dark vergence) indicate that fatigue can reduce a radiologist's ability to focus, especially at close viewing distances . It has also been found that subjective feelings of physical, mental, and emotional strain increase in radiologists who have spent as little as 8 hours interpreting clinical images. Both physical and subjective measures indicate that residents may actually be more vulnerable to effects of fatigue than attending radiologists.
