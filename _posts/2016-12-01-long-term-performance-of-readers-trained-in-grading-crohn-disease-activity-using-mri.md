## Rationale and Objectives

We aim to evaluate the long-term performance of readers who had participated in previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reader training in grading Crohn disease activity.

## Materials and Methods

Fourteen readers (8 women; 12 radiologists, 2 residents; mean age 40; range 31–59), who had participated in a previous MRI reader training, participated in a follow-up evaluation after a mean interval of 29 months (range 25–34 months). Follow-up evaluation comprised 25 MRI cases of suspected or known Crohn disease patients with direct feedback; cases were identical to the evaluation set used in the initial reader training (of which readers were unaware). Grading accuracy, overstaging, and understaging were compared between training and follow-up using a consensus score by two experienced abdominal radiologists as the reference standard.

## Results

In the follow-up evaluation, overall grading accuracy was 73% (95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 62%–81%), which was comparable to reader training grading accuracy (72%, 95% CI: 61%–80%) ( _P_ = .66). Overstaging decreased significantly from 19% (95% CI: 12%–27%) to 13% (95% CI: 8%–21%) between training and follow-up ( _P_ = .03), whereas understaging increased significantly from 9% (95% CI: 4%–21%) to 14% (95% CI: 7%–26%) ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

Readers have consistent long-term accuracy for grading Crohn disease activity after case-based reader training with direct feedback.

## Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred technique for assessment of disease activity in Crohn disease because of its capability to evaluate intra- and extramural disease of both small bowel and colon, without the use of ionizing radiation. A previous study showed that inexperienced radiologists and residents could be successfully trained to grade Crohn disease activity using case-based training . In that study, readers graded 100 MRI cases of patients with suspected or known Crohn disease, with the readers receiving direct feedback after each case. Significant improvement of grading accuracy was seen (66% to 75%, _P_ = .003), whereas understaging decreased significantly (15% to 7%, _P_ < .001).

Although case-based reader training can provide short-term improvement, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated long-term performance, as reader evaluation was always performed at the time of training. Furthermore, there is no knowledge of how daily practice impacts reader's level of experience after training.

Lesions in the small bowel and colon were assessed. In case of involvement of more than one lesion, the lesion with the highest activity score was leading in the final assessment.
