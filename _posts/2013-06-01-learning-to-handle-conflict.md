> Chimpanzees have given me so much. The long hours spent with them in the forest have enriched my life beyond measure. What I have learned from them has shaped my understanding of human behavior, of our place in nature. — _Jane Goodall_

Tension and conflict are essentially inevitable parts of human life. Each person sees work and personal life from a somewhat different perspective, and each brings a somewhat different set of interests and priorities to daily life. In some cases, such differences prove to be complementary. Two radiologists may focus on different aspects of a case, each noticing things that the other missed, and a conversation between them may produce better care than would either operating separately. In other cases, however, such differences can result in tension and even outright conflict. A radiologist who missed an imaging finding may feel resentful toward a colleague who detects it.

There are many different ways to handle such potential tensions and conflicts. One is to decrease the frequency of interaction between colleagues, based on the assumption that the less frequently people encounter one another, the less likely tensions will be to manifest themselves. However, this strategy undermines opportunities for collaboration and synergism, situations where people perform better together than they could individually. Another approach is to encourage colleagues not to take unsettling incidents personally, but it can be quite difficult for people to keep the professional and personal dimensions of their lives entirely separate.

Radiologists at all professional levels need to learn how to handle conflict more effectively. One seemingly unlikely place to turn for insights into conflict management is primatology. Primatologists study prosimians, which include species such as lemurs, as well as simians, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Some of the more notable features by which such creatures closely resemble human beings include relatively large brains, the enhancement of stereoscopic vision at the expense of the sense of smell, color vision, apposable thumbs, relatively pronounced sexual dimorphism, and relatively slow rates of development and maturation accompanied by a relatively long life span.

Our fascination with the similarities between apes and humans is reflected in the decades-long success of the “Planet of the Apes” franchise, which to date has included seven films, two television series, and a variety of books and comic books. Most large zoos feature primate exhibits, and species such as gorillas, orangutans, and chimpanzees are often among the most popular attractions. Aside from the fact that these species resemble humans more than any others, they are also our closest living biological relatives and give us an opportunity to study the development of human traits. Some biologists have suggested that they are like time machines, enabling us to better understand our own evolution. Educating ourselves about these close biological relatives can teach us much about ourselves.
