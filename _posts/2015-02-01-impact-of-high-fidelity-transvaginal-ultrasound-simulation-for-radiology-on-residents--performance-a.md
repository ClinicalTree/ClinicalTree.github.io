## Rationale and Objectives

Because of the intimate and uncomfortable nature of transvaginal ultrasound, training residents to perform this type of examination is a difficult task. As a consequence, residents may receive inadequate training that leads to a lack of the skills and confidence needed to perform this examination. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of using simulation sessions to teach residents how to perform transvaginal ultrasound, enabling them to diagnose obstetric and gynecologic emergencies and helping them survive on-calls alone while keeping their patients safe.

## Materials and Methods

We used an experimental study design to compare the confidence levels of 20 senior residents who received clinical training only to those of 25 junior residents who were enrolled in a simulation-based teaching session. We also compared the junior residents' levels of performance and confidence using transvaginal ultrasound before and after the sessions.

## Results

The performance of transvaginal ultrasound by the junior residents and their confidence levels significantly improved after they attended the simulation sessions. They had higher levels of confidence than the senior residents who did not attend the session. It was also observed that the number of nondiagnostic transvaginal ultrasounds performed by the on-call resident that needed to be repeated the next day had significantly dropped.

## Conclusions

Simulation-based teaching sessions are an effective method of education, which improve trainees' skills and confidence levels and improve patient safety.

With advances in computer technology, hardware, and software, ultrasound has become the modality of choice for many medical specialties, such as obstetrics and gynecology . Transvaginal ultrasound has been found to be the most extensively used imaging examination in this specialty . However, users face many difficulties in learning to use the tool as patients cannot tolerate the examination being extended because of the inexperienced operators. Additionally, training experience is limited due to the restrictions of many hospital policies and the shortage of sonographers . The development of high-fidelity mannequins provides an educational environment that fosters training in pelvic ultrasound simulation .

Simulation is now a well-established educational tool that fosters the learning process of health providers. It can be defined as an artificial replication of sufficient components of the real-world situation to achieve certain goals . It imitates many physical appearances, medical procedures, and clinical scenarios that allow trainees to obtain the necessary knowledge or skills without the need for real patients. Simulation offers the learner opportunities to become engaged in experiential learning . In comparison to learning that is not experiential in nature, simulation is acknowledged to be more effective . Furthermore, in correlation with patient safety, simulation provides new methods of teaching error management and promoting a culture of safety. It also offers ethical benefits, increasing the precision and relevance of training as well as competency assessment . Transvaginal ultrasound simulation has been shown to increase the confidentiality of trainees and has the potential to replace the initial clinical training on real patients .

McGaghie Mastery Learning Conceptual Framework


Element Action Performed Baseline or diagnostic testing Presession assessment was performed Clear learning objectives, sequenced as units in increasing difficulty The required psychomotor skill in obtaining the images of the female pelvic landmarks was clearly identified by the expertise Engagement in educational activities (eg, skills practice, data interpretation, reading, and focused on reaching the objectives) Simulation sessions were conducted focusing on the required skills only A set minimum passing standard (eg, test score) for each educational unit Each anatomic landmark is clearly identified Formative testing to gauge unit completion at a preset minimum passing standard for mastery Assessment within the sessions was performed with immediate feedback Advancement to the next educational unit gave a measured achievement at or above the mastery standard The expected common radiologic appearance of common pathology was discussed briefly in the sessions Continued practice or study on an educational unit until the mastery standard is reached Postsession assessment was performed after 2–3 months
