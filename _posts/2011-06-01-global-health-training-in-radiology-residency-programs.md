## Rationale and Objectives

To measure perceptions of radiology residents regarding the imaging needs of the developing world and the potential role of an organized global health imaging curriculum during residency training.

## Materials and Methods

An electronic survey was created and then distributed to residents in accredited US radiology residency.

## Results

Two hundred ninety-four residents responded to the survey. A majority (61%) planned to pursue future international medical aid work, even though a similar proportion (59%) believed that they would be ill-prepared with their current training to pursue this career goal. The vast majority (91%) of respondents stated that their residency program offers no opportunities to participate in global health imaging experiences. Most surveyed residents felt that an organized global health imaging curriculum would improve understanding of basic disease processes (87%) and cost-conscious care (82%), prepare residents for lifelong involvement in global health (80%), and increase interpretative skills in basic radiology modalities (73%). If such a curriculum were available, most (62%) of surveyed residents stated that they would be likely or very likely to participate. Many (58%) believed the availability of such a program would have influenced their choice of residency program; a similar proportion of residents (75%) believed that the availability of a global health imaging curriculum would increase recruitment to the field of radiology.

## Conclusion

Many radiology residents are motivated to acquire global health imaging experience, with most survey respondents planning to participate in global health initiatives. These data demonstrate an imbalance between the level of resident interest and the availability of global health imaging opportunities, and support the need for discussion on how to implement global health imaging training within radiology residency programs.

As globalization progresses, there is increasing agreement among medical educators that global health should be a standard component of general medical education in the United States . There is also a growing need for medical specialists in global health efforts, particularly as an increasing number of academic, government, and nongovernment organizations expand delivery of health care to developing nations in efforts to address the marked inequities in disease burden relative to health care expenditure (  Fig 1 ). Radiology is an important component of global public health programs, including those that address tuberculosis, AIDS-related diseases, trauma, breast cancer screening, and maternal-infant health care. Yet, the World Health Organization reports that approximately two thirds of the world’s population lacks adequate access to medical imaging; the scarcity of imaging services in developing regions contributes to a widening disparity of health care and limits the role of radiology in global public health programs that require imaging . Efforts to redress this lack of access to imaging services in the developing world have encountered significant challenges, including limited access to equipment, poor sustainability, shortages of trained personnel, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of interest .

Table 1


Geographic Distribution of Radiology Resident Sample Population Relative to Actual Radiology Resident Population (ie, Does the Geographic Distribution of Surveyed Residents Mirror the Real Geographic Distribution of Radiology Residents?)


Subregion Region West (%) Midwest (%) South (%) Northeast (%) Pacific (CA, WA, OR, AK, HI) 7.1 Mountain (WY, ID, MT, NV, UT, CO, AZ, NM) −2.3 West North Central (ND, SD, NE, KS, MO, IA, MN) −1.8 East North Central (WI, MI, IL, IN, OH) −2.0 West South Central (TX, OK, AR, LA) −2.5 East South Central (MS, AL, KY, TN) 2.5 South Atlantic (FL, GA, SC, NC, VA, DC, MD, WV, DE) 5.9 Middle Atlantic (PA, NY, NJ) −6.5 New England (ME, VT, NH, CT, MA, RI) −0.4 Totals 4.8 −3.8 5.8 −6.9

Based on this analysis, we oversampled the West and South and undersampled the Midwest and Northeast; however, there was no significant association between region and the survey responses.
