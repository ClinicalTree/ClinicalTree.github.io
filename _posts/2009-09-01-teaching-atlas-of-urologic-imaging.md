_Teaching Atlas of Urologic Imaging_ uses a case-based approach to present the most commonly encountered urologic conditions. The coauthors of this text, Robert A. Older and Matthew J. Bissignani, are both well-established experts in the field of genitourinary imaging from the Department of Radiology at the University of Virginia. Urologic imaging has changed with the advent of newer technology, and this text reflects these advancements. Traditional imaging techniques such as abdominal plain films and intravenous pyelograms are included; however, the authors have put an emphasis on the newer imaging modalities including computed tomography-intravenous pyelography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. In the forward, coauthor Dr. Matthew Bissignani describes the book as being “intended for radiologists and urologists in training, as well as for practicing board certified physicians wanting to review the imaging findings of many common urologic diseases.” Though this book is not (and was not intended to be) an all-inclusive reference, it does meet the intentions of the authors.

_Teaching Atlas of Urologic Imaging_ presents the most commonly encountered genitourinary conditions in a case-based format. The text consists of 12 chapters, each of which addresses the major subdivisions of urologic imaging. These chapters include but are not limited to congenital abnormalities, infection, renal cystic diseases, renal neoplasms, adrenal and testicular pathology, and trauma. There is also a chapter on the use of intravenous contrast in urologic imaging, as well as how to manage the occasional complications associated with the administration of these agents. Each chapter consists of 3 to 14 cases. Each case begins with a brief clinical description and initial imaging study. The initially presented imaging studies are usually kidneys, ureters, and bladder abdominal films or intravenous pyelography studies. The initial presentation is followed by a discussion of the pertinent findings, the diagnosis, and relevant differential diagnoses. Next follows a discussion of the abnormality including pathology, characteristic imaging findings, and recommendations for further imaging workup. These discussions address the more advanced urologic imaging modalities and the characteristic findings of the abnormality on these studies. The differential diagnoses are also briefly described, and an explanation of why they are not the correct diagnosis is given. Finally, the treatment and prognosis is addressed. Each case concludes with a brief list of references for further reading if desired. The text is followed by an extensive appendix that includes information on the management of contrast reactions, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography protocols, several tables summarizing the classification of renal cysts and genitourinary organ trauma, and tumor staging classifications.

This text has many strengths that make it a valuable resource for radiology, urology, and nephrology residents. The authors should be applauded for organizing the book into a concise and easy-to-read format. _Teaching Atlas of Urologic Imaging_ covers the majority of the commonly encountered and tested genitourinary abnormalities. The text includes 372 high-quality images, including 47 full-color diagrams that illustrate anatomy and pathology. Though there is emphasis placed on new imaging techniques, the text recognizes the importance of understanding the more traditional methods of genitourinary imaging, including kidneys, ureters, and bladder abdominal films and intravenous pyelography. The case-based format probably best lends itself to residents, in particular those residents that are preparing for board examinations. Board-certified physicians may find this book useful as a quick reference for information on common urologic conditions and further imaging options. The appendix is a great resource for magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography protocols as well as genitourinary pathology classification schemes.

The authors have written this book with the intent of offering a case-based review of the more common urologic conditions. With this mission in mind, the authors have succeeded. However, it should be understood that _Teaching Atlas of Urologic Imaging_ is not an all-inclusive reference of genitourinary conditions and pathology. Readers seeking a reference text or in-depth information would be better served by reading one of the major references in the field. In addition, this text may be too basic for board-certified practicing physicians.

Though urologic abnormalities have not changed, the recent expansion in technology available for diagnostic imaging has changed the way that these conditions are imaged. _Teaching Atlas of Urologic Imaging_ provides a case-based review of the more commonly encountered abnormalities in the field of urology and nephrology. The text includes the condition's appearance on the more traditional imaging modalities as well as the more sophisticated imaging modalities available in current practice. This text lives up to the intentions of its authors by providing a review of the more important and commonly encountered genitourinary conditions.
