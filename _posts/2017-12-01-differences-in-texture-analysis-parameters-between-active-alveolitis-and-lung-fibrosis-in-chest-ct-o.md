## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to determine the diagnostic aid of computed tomography (CT) features for the differentiation of active alveolitis and fibrosis using a CT texture analysis (CTTA) prototype and CT densitometry in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) using ancillary high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features and their longitudinal course as standard of reference.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively analyzed thin-slice noncontrast chest CT image data of 43 patients with SSc (18 men, mean age 51.55 ± 15.52 years; range 23–71 years). All of them had repeated noncontrast enhanced HRCT of the lung. Classification into active alveolitis or fibrosis was done on HRCT based on classical HRCT findings (active alveolitis \[19; 44.2%\] and fibrosis \[24; 55.8%\]) and their course at midterm. Results were compared to pulmonary functional tests and were followed up by CT. Ground glass opacity was considered suggestive of alveolitis, whereas coarse reticulation with parenchymal distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycombing were assigned to fibrosis.

## Results

Statistically significant differences in CTTA were found for first-order textural features (mean intensity, average, deviation, skewness) and second-order statistics (entropy of co-occurrence matrix, mean number of nonuniformity (NGLDM), entropy of NGLDM, entropy of heterogeneity, intensity, and average). Cut-off value for the prediction of fibrosis at baseline was significant for entropy of intensity ( _P_ value < .001) and for mean deviation ( _P_ value < .001), and for prediction of alveolitis was significant for uniformity of intensity ( _P_ value < .001) and for NGLDM ( _P_ value < .001).

At pulmonary functional tests, forced expiratory volume in 1 second and single-breath diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide were significantly lower in fibrosis than in alveolitis 2.03 ± 0.78 vs. 2.61 ± 0.83, _P_ < .016 and 4.51 ± 1.61 vs. 6.04 ± 1.75, _P_ < .009, respectively. Differences in CT densitometry between alveolitis and fibrosis were not significant.

## Conclusions

CTTA parameters are significantly different in active alveolitis vs. fibrosis in patients with SSc and may be helpful for differentiation of these two entities.

## Introduction

Pulmonary involvement in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is frequent and greatly impacts morbidity and mortality . Respiratory symptoms occur first with disease progression and are confirmed with abnormal pulmonary function tests (PFT) at advanced stages . Although advanced fibrosis can be detected with chest radiography, active alveolitis, which represents a reversible, inflammatory component, may not be visible on radiography and requires high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) . HRCT shows pulmonary abnormalities in up to 90% of patients with SSc, whereas PFT are abnormal in only 40%–75% of cases . For this reason, CT has advanced to a major diagnostic tool for detection and quantification of pulmonary involvement and is now recommended in all patients with SSc for accurate evaluation of this target organ .
