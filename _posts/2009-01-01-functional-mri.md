## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the functional alterations of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with magnetic resonance dynamic perfusion imaging.

## Materials and methods

Twenty-one healthy subjects (42 kidneys) and 20 CKD patients (40 kidneys) underwent routine scans with fat-saturated T1-weighted fast low angle shot (FLASH) and true-fast imaging with steady-state precession (FISP) sequences followed by dynamic perfusion scans using a turbo-FLASH T1-weighted sequence. Signal intensity (SI) of the cortex and medulla on images was measured and plotted as a function of time. Peak height (P) and time to peak (T) of the cortex and medulla SI were estimated, and P/T ratio and the area under the time-intensity curves were calculated. We also tested the correlation between these data and serum creatinine (sCr) levels in patients.

## Results

P, P/T ratio, and the area under the curve of patients' cortex and medulla were significantly decreased compared to control subjects, and T was delayed. In patients, P and P/T ratio of the cortex and P of the medulla were negatively correlated with sCr levels ( _r_ = −0.469, _r_ = −0.419, and _r_ = −0.423, respectively; _P_ < 0.01).

## Conclusion

Renal dysfunction in CKD can be evaluated by magnetic resonance dynamic perfusion imaging.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has several distinct advantages in the kidney compared to other imaging methods. Ultrasound scanning (US) is suitable for morphologic evaluation but does not supply information about renal function. Intravenous urography (IVU) allows visualization of general morphology and simple functional evaluation of the kidney. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has excellent spatial and temporal resolution, but the contrast used during IVU and CT is nephrotoxic and unfit for patients with renal dysfunction. Although nuclear medicine has provided reliable functional data, inability to visualize the kidney and lack of spatial resolution limit morphologic evaluation.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI has great potential in providing both morphologic and functional information in the kidney ( ). Dynamic T1 contrast-enhancement is a commonly used MRI technique. T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) is shortened because of the dipole–dipole interaction of the contrast agent, which corresponds to increased signal intensity (SI) in T1-weighted imaging. A common contrast agent, gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) is not contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function ( ), and it is therefore possible to study renal perfusion and excretion in patients with chronic renal dysfunction using dynamic MRI.
