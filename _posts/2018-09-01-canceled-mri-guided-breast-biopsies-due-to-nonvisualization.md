## Rationale and Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate breast lesion outcomes in patients after canceled MRI-guided breast biopsy due to lesion nonvisualization.

## Materials and Methods

Electronic medical records (January 2007–December 2014) were searched for patients with canceled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided breast biopsies due to lesion nonvisualization. A total of 1403 MRI-detected lesions were scheduled for MRI-guided biopsy and 89 were canceled because of nonvisualization. Imaging studies and medical records were reviewed for patient demographics, lesion characteristics, and subsequent malignancy. Patients without adequate MRI follow-up imaging were excluded. Statistical analysis was employed to determine if patient demographics or lesion characteristics were predictive of lesion resolution or lesion biopsy after subsequent follow-up.

## Results

Eighty-nine (6.3% \[89/1403\]; 95% confidence interval, 5.2%–7.7%) biopsies in 89 women were canceled because of nonvisualization. Follow-up MRIs greater than 5.5 months were available for 60.7% (54/89) of women. In 74.1% (40/54) of these patients, the lesions completely resolved on follow-up. In 25.9% (14/54) of the patients, the lesion persisted on follow-up; 42.9% (6/14) of these patients underwent biopsy. One case (1.9% \[1/54\]) yielded ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion at the 6-month follow-up. No patient demographics or lesion features were associated with lesion resolution or lesion biopsy.

## Conclusions

The majority of canceled MRI-guided biopsy lesions resolved on later follow-up; however, because of the small possibility of a missed malignancy, follow-up MRI imaging at 6 months is recommended.

## Introduction

Numerous studies have demonstrated the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) breast cancer detection compared to mammography and ultrasound, particularly in high-risk patient populations . Additionally, the advent of MRI-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy has provided a relatively quick and safe method of sampling tissue, sparing patients the time and invasiveness of a surgical biopsy . In some instances, however, MRI-guided biopsies may be canceled; reported rates of biopsy cancellation have ranged from 8% to 13%, most often because of nonvisualization of the initial biopsy target on the scheduled day of biopsy . Lesions may not be visualized because the lesion has resolved at the time of biopsy and may have only been due to background parenchymal enhancement (BPE), now no longer seen. In other cases, however, lesions may be canceled for technical reasons such as poor patient positioning or compression, which may impede contrast delivery to the breast. These canceled biopsies can thus be a source of confusion and frustration for both clinicians and patients. Only a few studies have specifically investigated the clinical course of these nonvisualized lesions; the reported frequency of subsequent malignancy has ranged from 0% to 10% .

A better understanding of the longer term outcomes after nonvisualization of an MRI-guided biopsy target is warranted to help guide decisions regarding appropriate follow-up and treatment. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate outcomes—including subsequent development of ipsilateral quadrant malignancy—in patients who had a canceled MRI-guided breast biopsy due to nonvisualization of the lesion on the day of biopsy. A secondary purpose was to determine if any patient demographics or lesion characteristics were predictive of lesion resolution or lesion biopsy after subsequent follow-up.

![Figure 3, Thirty-seven-year-old woman with a history of right ADH and a recently diagnosed right ductal carcinoma in situ who underwent a diagnostic breast MRI. (a) On sagittal dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI with subtraction, a 1.0-cm mass with type 3 kinetics was seen within the posterior right breast ( white arrow ). MRI-guided biopsy was recommended. (b) On sagittal dynamic contrast-enhanced right breast MRI with subtraction performed on the day of biopsy performed 2 weeks later, this lesion appeared to have resolved ( white arrow ); the MRI biopsy was thus canceled. On review, it is likely that compression, as well as grid positioning factors, in light of the far posterior location of the lesion, contributed to nonvisualization. (c) Sagittal dynamic contrast-enhanced right breast MRI with subtraction performed 6 months later revealed a conspicuous 1.0-cm mass within the posterior right breast ( white arrow ). A mammogram performed on the same day showed new calcifications that correlated with the mass; a stereotactic biopsy was performed, yielding ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion.
