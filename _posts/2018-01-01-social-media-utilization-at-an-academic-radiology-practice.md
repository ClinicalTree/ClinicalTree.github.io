## Rationale and Objectives

We report social media (SoMe) utilization trends at an academic radiology department, highlighting differences between trainees and faculty and between Baby Boomers versus Generation X and Millennials.

## Materials and Methods

An anonymous online survey regarding SoMe utilization and SoMe-based educational curriculum was distributed to all radiologists (trainees and faculty) in our department. Regular chi-square, ordered (Mantel-Haenszel) chi-square, and Fischer exact tests were performed.

## Results

The survey instrument was sent to 172 radiologists with a 65% completion rate ( _N_ = 112). Eighty-three percent ( _n_ = 92) of the respondents use SoMe, with Facebook (67%, _n_ = 75), YouTube (57%, _n_ = 64), Instagram (26%, _n_ = 29), and Twitter (21%, _n_ = 23) as the most commonly used platforms. Eighty-one percent ( _n_ = 91) use SoMe for 30 minutes or less per day. Thirty-five percent ( _n_ = 39) reported previously using SoMe for educational purposes, although 66% ( _n_ = 73) would be willing to join SoMe for educational activities. The faculty are more likely than trainees to avoid using SoMe (30% vs 9%, _P_ < 0.03). Trainees are more likely than faculty to find an electronic case-based curriculum valuable (95% vs 83%, _P_ < 0.05) and are willing to spend more time on cases ( _P_ < 0.01). Baby Boomers are less interested in joining SoMe for educational activities than Generation X and Millennials (24% vs 73%, _P_ = 0.0001).

## Conclusions

Generation gaps between trainees and faculty, as well as between Generation X and Millennials versus Baby Boomers, exist with regard to the use of SoMe, which may be underutilized in radiology education.

## Introduction

Social media (SoMe) is pervasive in modern life. Recent data from the Pew Research Center suggests that 85% of adults in the United States are now Internet users, a sizeable proportion of which utilize one or more SoMe applications (apps), such as Facebook (  facebook.com , Menlo Park, CA), Twitter (  twitter.com , San Francisco, CA), YouTube (  youtube.com , San Bruno, CA), Instagram (  instagram.com , Menlo Park, CA), Snapchat (  snapchat.com , Venice, CA), or WhatsApp (  whatsapp.com , Mountain View, CA) . This rate of utilization has grown dramatically over the past decade, with 65% of American adults now using SoMe, up from just 7% in 2005 . Although the usage of several SoMe platforms has begun leveling off over the past couple years, utilization continues to hold steady, particularly among young adults .

In recent years, SoMe use has gained substantial traction in the medical community. In radiology, it has been promoted as a successful tool to increase the visibility of radiology departments ; to promote research and academic endeavors on a national or international stage ; to engage radiologists within departments ; to increase readership and grow audiences of medical journals ; and to foster relationships between radiologists, referring physicians, and patients . In fact, some data suggest that private practice radiology practices have embraced SoMe more fervently and effectively than academic radiology practices .

## SoMe Utilization

[Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article<](https://clinicalpub.com/app)

![Figure 1, SoMe platforms utilized by respondents. Among all respondents, Facebook was most commonly utilized (67%), followed by YouTube (57%), Instagram (26%), Twitter (21%), WhatsApp (19%), and Snapchat (12%). Other platforms utilized by respondents include Flickr, MySpace, Tinder, Grindr, Reddit, and Telegram (each <1%). Overall, SoMe utilization is high (83% of the respondents), but the faculty were significantly less likely to use SoMe than trainees (faculty rate of non-SoMe utilization 25% vs. trainee non-SoMe utilization 9%, P = 0.0292).

![Figure 2, Reported daily time spent on social media. Although trainees spend more time daily on social media, the majority (81%) of all respondents (trainees + faculty) report using it for 30 minutes or less per day.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SocialMediaUtilizationatanAcademicRadiologyPractice/1_1s20S1076633217303719.jpg)

![Figure 3, SoMe use for education. Among the surveyed radiologists, prior use of SoMe for education purposes was low (35%) with similar utilization reported between trainees and faculty. A substantial number of radiologists (66%) reported willingness to join SoMe to participate in future educational activities, although Generation X and Millennials reported significantly greater willingness to join SoMe for educational activities than Baby Boomers (Generation X and Millennials 73%, n = 68, vs Baby Boomers 24%, n = 4; P = 0.0001).
