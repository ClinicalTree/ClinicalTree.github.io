## Rationale and Objectives

The role of a radiologist has expanded beyond the tripartite mission of patient care, education, and research to include cross-specialty consultation for patient management, innovative solutions to improve health-care quality and safety, device design, and policy advocacy. As such, radiology residency programs should incorporate formalized training to prepare residents for these various professional roles.

## Materials and Methods

Since the 2015–2016 academic year, five training tracks focused on noninterpretative skills have been integrated into our residency training program: Clinician Educator, Quality Improvement, Entrepreneurship/Innovation, Health Policy Advocacy, and High-Value Care. Each track is longitudinal, with a set of requirements throughout the residents' training necessary to achieve certification at graduation.

## Results

To date nine residents have participated in the programs, including two who received distinction in two separate tracks. Residents in each of the tracks have implemented successful initiatives related to the focus area. As such, these tracks enrich training by ensuring that residents make meaningful contributions to the department and institution during their training and disseminate successful initiatives through presentation at national meetings and publications.

## Conclusion

The duration of a radiology residency and resources available in an academic center provide opportunities for residency program directors to advance residents' skills in important noninterpretative components of radiology practice. Regardless of whether residents pursue academic medicine or private practice, these skills are necessary for graduates to become valuable members of a radiology practice and serve as national leaders in the field of radiology.

## Introduction

The role of a radiologist involves more than the interpretation of images; radiologists also act as educators, policy advisors, consultants, inventors, and quality improvement leaders. To prepare for these various roles radiologists will likely undertake in their professional careers, it is valuable for diagnostic radiology residency programs to offer learning opportunities in these areas during training. Indeed, one of the overarching goals of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) training is to create a foundation for professional growth. The ACGME also cites several specific noninterpretative skills in its “Core Competencies” of diagnostic radiology residency, including quality improvement, participation in education, acting as a consultant, and supporting improved patient care (ACGME) .

Our residency has a long-standing research track, with the opportunity to complete a full year of funded research through a departmental T32 grant. Other institutions have reported on novel programs to encourage career development in important noninterpretative areas of professional development including teaching (to prepare residents for academic careers); entrepreneurship (to train and encourage residents to create new devices and technologies); health-care policy (to educate residents on issues related to the health-care system and develop leadership skills in this area); and quality improvement .
