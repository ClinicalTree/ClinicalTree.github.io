_Skeletal Radiology: The Bare Bones_ by Felix S. Chew is a concise, introductory primer to musculoskeletal imaging geared mainly toward radiologists and radiologists-in-training.

As a single unified textbook, _Skeletal Radiology: The Bare Bones_ , teaches the general principles of skeletal radiology and presents the core knowledge base in musculoskeletal imaging necessary for a radiology resident. The four main parts of this text include trauma, tumors, joint disease, and miscellaneous topics. In miscellaneous topics, the author covers developmental and congenital conditions, metabolic and systemic conditions, infection, marrow disease, and postsurgical imaging. This single volume text is now in its third edition with thoroughly updated information and includes an increasingly significant amount of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Newer digital images have replaced older radiographs where appropriate. Updated sources and readings are included at the end of each chapter. The emphasis of this text is on explanations and descriptions to help understand how radiologic findings mirror underlying musculoskeletal conditions. This book helps the reader consider clinically relevant possibilities and devise strategies for distinguishing among them with certainty when confronted with a musculoskeletal image and clinical case.

Part I covers trauma, beginning with an approach to trauma and concluding with separate chapters for upper/lower extremity, spine, trauma in children, fracture healing, and treatment. Part II covers tumor and tumor-like lesions, beginning with an approach to bone lesions and concluding with separate chapters on malignant and aggressive tumors, benign lesions, and metastatic tumors. Part III covers joint disease with separate chapters on inflammatory arthritis and noninflammatory joint disease. Part IV covers miscellaneous topics as outlined presently. The postsurgical imaging chapter includes a thorough discussion on the use of imaging in joint replacement.

I find _Skeletal Radiology: The Bare Bones_ quite useful for interested medical students, practicing radiologists, musculoskeletal radiology fellows, and especially radiology residents interested in musculoskeletal imaging. Although this text is specifically geared toward radiologists and radiologists-in-training, it is also useful for practitioners and trainees in all fields who deal with the diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal disease. _Skeletal Radiology: The Bare Bones_ is an excellent textbook and helps the engaged reader to develop a firm foundation in musculoskeletal imaging.
