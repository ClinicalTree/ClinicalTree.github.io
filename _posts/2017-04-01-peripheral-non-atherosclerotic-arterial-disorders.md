Peripheral non-atherosclerotic arterial disorders (NAADs) are a heterogeneous group of rather uncommon conditions that tend to manifest in subjects without atherosclerosis. Each of these conditions has distinctive pathophysiology; however, there are some common clinical and radiological characteristics and in some cases a common treatment approach that unifies these conditions to a specific group, hence the NAADs. Clinicians and radiologists often fail to recognize NAADs, and there might be a delay in the management of such patients; this may result in seriously adverse outcomes that could otherwise have been avoided or minimized. Knowledge of these conditions and of their radiological appearances is therefore important to help establish a correct diagnosis to allow the prompt initiation of treatment.

The purpose of this pictorial review is to present a selection of NAADs cases and to discuss the radiological characteristics and the most common lines of therapeutic approaches.

## Introduction

Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) because of atherosclerosis is more prevalent in men older than 50 years, commonly presenting with intermittent claudication and is associated with morbidity (limb loss) and mortality (increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke) . In a minority of cases, symptoms of intermittent claudication and mimics of PVD are precipitated by non-atherosclerotic arterial disorders (NAADs). The latter patients are often younger, have little or no risk factors for atherosclerosis, and have delayed diagnosis and sometimes, incorrect treatment. Knowledge of these uncommon conditions and their radiological appearance is essential for early diagnosis and initiation of treatment. NAADs are of a heterogeneous group and range from congenital anatomical variations external to the affected vessel to pathologic changes within the vessel wall .

## Congenital Anatomical Variation

## Persistent Sciatic Artery (PSA)

A PSA is a remnant of the embryological vessel that serves as the main blood supply to the lower limb during early fetal development . The persistent vessel is a direct continuation of the iliac artery to the popliteal artery and is classified in complete and incomplete types. In the _complete_ PSA, detected in the majority of cases, there is direct communication between the internal iliac artery and the popliteal artery. This is associated with a hypoplastic short segment of superficial femoral artery that ends high in the thigh. Patients with this condition are characteristically presented with a popliteal pulse in combination with the absence of a groin pulse. In the _incomplete_ variant, alongside a normal femoral arterial system, a partially involuted sciatic artery remains, which communicates with the popliteal artery via collaterals.

Selective catheterization of the internal iliac artery is, therefore, essential to identify this anomalous vessel to avoid a misdiagnosis of a femoral artery occlusion. Clinical findings and symptoms are a result of aneurysm formation as the sciatic artery courses through the sciatic foramen, which can be complicated by thrombosis, embolization, and sciatic nerve compression (  Fig 1 ) .

Note the small distal superficial femoral arteries ( white arrowheads ).
