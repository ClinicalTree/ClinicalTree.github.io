## Rationale and Objectives

Patient-centered care has become a primary focus in clinical practice. In developing practice guidelines for clinical care, the patients' perspective is an important component.

## Materials and Methods

Patients' preferences are represented in a decision analytic model as quality-of-life weights for different health states associated with the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage population. The time–tradeoff method is used to obtain the individual patients' preferences, which are directly measured in quality-adjusted life years. An individualized care model is explained as a means of implementing a patient-centered approach into practice guidelines for clinical care. A method for calculating the expected value for societal benefit from improved decision making using an individualized care model is reviewed.

## Results

We discuss our work-in-progress towards incorporating patients' preferences in a decision analytic model for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. The main methodologic concerns for using patients' preferences in cost-effectiveness analyses for developing practice guidelines are discussed.

## Conclusion

Emphasis is placed on using patients' preferences and patient-centered outcome measures in cost-effectiveness analyses.

In recent years, there has been improved awareness and effort to implement patient-centered care in clinical practice. With the advent of patient involvement in addressing health care issues and government policy making, patient-centered care has become a primary focus in developing practice guidelines. In this setting, the patient is considered as the ultimate judge of the quality of medical care services. By applying this concept specifically to radiology practice, the patient is regarded as the authority on determining an imaging experience as acceptable care, including the outcome management from the examination performed. Thereby, patients' preferences and patient-centered outcomes are an important component in developing practice guidelines for clinical care.

Practice guidelines have been defined as systematically developed statements to assist both physicians and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances . Issues related to costs, benefit, quality, access, patients' preferences, and utilization are some factors considered in developing practice guidelines. Emphasis is placed on developing systematic practice guidelines using evidence-based medicine, such as conclusions drawn from decision analyses to determine quality of life and cost-effectiveness.
