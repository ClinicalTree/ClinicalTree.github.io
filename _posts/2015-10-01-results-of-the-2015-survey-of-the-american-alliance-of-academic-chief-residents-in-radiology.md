## Rationale and Objectives

The American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology conducts an annual survey of chief residents in Diagnostic Radiology programs in North America. The survey serves as a resource for observing trends and disseminating ideas among radiology training programs.

## Materials and Methods

An online survey was distributed to chief residents at 181 residency programs, with questions on a broad range of topics including resident benefits, program and call structure, American Board of Radiology Core exam preparation, fellowships, and the job market.

## Results

A total of 193 individual responses were received from 120 programs, for a response rate of 66%. The responses were compared to data from prior years' surveys, principally from 2012 to 2014.

## Conclusions

Programs are shifting resident benefits spending toward Core exam preparation resources and away from lead aprons. In addition, 24-hour attending coverage continues to spread among programs, and the fraction of programs providing face-to-face postcall readouts continues to decline. Finally, although resident perception of the job market is now improving, residents feel that the job market continues to discourage medical students from entering radiology, a fact borne out by the 2015 match results. How the upcoming change to a direct interventional radiology residency will affect medical student interest is as yet uncertain.

The American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology (A  3 CR  2 ) is an organization composed of chief residents at North American Diagnostic Radiology residency training programs with the purpose of developing leadership skills in chief residents and fostering collaboration and idea dissemination among its members . Each year, as part of its mission, the A  3 CR  2 conducts a survey of its members regarding a broad range of topics including resident benefits, program and call structure, American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core preparation, fellowships, and the job market. The results of this survey are presented at the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) annual meeting and are also made available on the A  3 CR  2 Web site. The survey has been administered since 1971, with maintenance of survey data at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology .

Many chief residents and residency program directors and chairs of academic departments use the information from the survey to compare their programs to peer institutions and potentially guide program policies and budgetary decisions. Survey questions are formulated by chief residents at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology using input from faculty advisors involved in the A  3 CR  2 and chief resident members of the A  3 CR  2 Steering Committee. The questions are updated each year based on findings in previous years' data and emerging trends in the world of academic radiology and radiology training programs.

Predictors of programs with a Core exam pass rate >75% (as compared to ≤75%), analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. A total of 101 programs were included in this analysis, with 17 of 101 cases having a pass rate ≤75%. Odds ratios greater than 1.0 imply a higher chance for that program to have a pass rate >75%.
