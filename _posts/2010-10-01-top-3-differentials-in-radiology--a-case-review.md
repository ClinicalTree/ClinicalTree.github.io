_Top 3 Differentials in Radiology: A Case Review_ by William T. O'Brien Sr, DO, is a comprehensive case-based radiology review book intended primarily for residents and general radiologists preparing for board certification and for more senior radiologists preparing for recertification. Published by Thieme, this softcover text contains 12 core sections based on specific radiologic subspecialties. The aim of the text is to focus on developing differential diagnoses on the basis of key findings, with a follow-up concise and high-yield discussion regarding each entity in the differential list. A total of 325 cases are provided as unknowns initially, and more than 700 high-quality images, including 74 in color, are included depicting key findings.

The 12 core sections are as follows: “Chest and Cardiac,” “Gastrointestinal,” “Genitourinary,” “Musculoskeletal,” “Head and Neck,” “Brain and Spine,” “Pediatric,” “Ultrasound,” “Fetal,” “Vascular and Interventional,” “Nuclear Medicine,” and “Breast Imaging.” The final section is titled “Roentgen Classics” and contains 25 unknown cases representing each of the previous core sections. These “classic” cases have characteristic findings that lead one to a single AuntMinnie definitive diagnosis. Each core section itself contains 25 unknown cases representing the most common or typical cases a radiologist may see on board exams or in general practice. The initial page of each case presents readers with radiographic images from an unknown case, with a short clinical history and a description of the findings. The second page lists the key finding from the presented images and breaks down a list of differential diagnoses into a “top 3,” along with additional diagnostic considerations for some of the cases. The discussion section for the cases gives a concise review on each of the differentials provided, making this book ultimately useful as a high-yield preparatory text for board review. In addition, imaging pearls are provided at the end of each case to allow a rapid review of key teaching points.

I find _Top 3 Differentials in Radiology_ extremely useful for practicing radiologists and radiology residents looking to brush up on core radiology knowledge and acquire the most pertinent knowledge in preparation for board exams, recertification, and general practice. Daily practice and residency are demanding in their own ways, and this wonderful text provides a concise and informative approach to continued learning for motivated individuals. The image quality and overall discussions of each case are excellent and without perceived errors. Further details regarding each case can be found in more detailed texts and review articles provided as references at the end of individual cases. I enjoyed reading through the cases using this resource and approach, as I feel it helps retain information better than more comprehensive texts, in which there is usually too much information to digest in one sitting. As residents and busy radiologists, we need more “to the point” information, which this text does a great job of providing.

_Top 3 Differentials in Radiology_ is an excellent case-based review book using an approach closely resembling the format of oral and computer-based exams in radiology today. This high-yield way of learning allows the rapid development of a reasonable list of differential diagnoses on the basis of key findings for the full range of entities commonly encountered in practice and board exam settings. Despite the future changes in the radiology board exam from the American Board of Radiology, this text will continue to cater to the needs of residents and practicing radiologists because of its accurate descriptions and high-yield information regarding top differentials for key diagnoses and findings. The author states that his “goal was to design the book that I wish I had when preparing for the board examinations.” He falls nothing short of creating his vision, and radiologists who purchase and read this text will be grateful to have this wonderful review resource. This review book is not only rewarding but also a resource radiologists can continue to refer to throughout their careers.
