## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the potential value of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained at standard (700 s/mm  2 ) and high (1500 s/mm  2 ) _b_ values on a 3.0-T scanner in the differentiation of bladder cancer from benign lesions and in assessing bladder tumors of different pathologic T stages and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ADC-based histogram parameters.

## Materials and Methods

In all, 52 patients with bladder lesions, including benign lesions ( _n_ = 7) and malignant tumors ( _n_ = 45; T1 stage or less, 23; T2 stage, 7; T3 stage, 8; and T4 stage, 7), were retrospectively evaluated. Magnetic resonance examination at 3.0 T and diffusion-weighted imaging were performed. ADC maps were obtained at two _b_ values ( _b_ = 700 and 1500 s/mm  2 ; ie, ADC-700 and ADC-1500). Parameters of histogram analysis included mean, kurtosis, skewness, and entropy. The correlations between these parameters and pathologic results were revealed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the diagnostic value of histogram parameters.

## Results

Significant differences were found in mean ADC-700, mean ADC-1500, skewness ADC-1500, and kurtosis ADC-1500 between bladder cancer and benign lesions ( _P_ = .002–.032). There were also significant differences in mean ADC-700, mean ADC-1500, and kurtosis ADC-1500 among bladder tumors of different pathologic T stages ( _P_ = .000–.046). No significant differences were observed in other parameters. Mean ADC-1500 and kurtosis ADC-1500 were significantly correlated with T stage, respectively (ρ = −0.614, _P_ < .001; ρ = 0.374, _P_ = .011). ROC analysis showed that the combination of mean ADC-1500 and kurtosis ADC-1500 has the maximal area under the ROC curve (AUC, 0.894; _P_ < .001) in the differentiation of benign lesions and malignant tumors, with a sensitivity of 77.78% and specificity of 100%. AUCs for differentiating low- and high-stage tumors were 0.840 for mean ADC-1500 ( _P_ < .001) and 0.696 for kurtosis ADC-1500 ( _P_ = .015).

## Conclusions

Histogram analysis of ADC-1500 at 3.0 T can be useful in evaluation of bladder lesions. A combination of mean ADC-1500 and kurtosis ADC-1500 may be more beneficial in the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions. Mean ADC-1500 was the most promising parameter for differentiating low- from high-stage bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer is the most common type of malignant tumor in urinary tract, which is hazardous heavily to human health among both men and women . Preoperative assessment of the bladder cancer pathologic T stage, which is a measure of clinical aggressiveness, is the most primary factor in choosing the most appropriate treatment method. As a result, disease prognosis can be different among patients depending on different tumor stages. Low-stage superficial tumors (T1 stage or lower) are associated with low risk of progression and can be effectively treated by local endoscopic resection with a favorable survival rate. On the other hand, high-stage invasive tumors (T2 stage or higher) often develop metastatic disease and are treated either by curative cystectomy or by radiation therapy or chemotherapy .

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique has shown its ability to diagnose bladder cancer and distinguish tumors of different stages . DWI is based on the microscopic diffusion movements in the protons of the tissues' water molecules and can reveal information about microstructure complexity, such as, cellularity, integrity of the cellular membranes, and aggregation of macromolecules . Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which is a quantitative parameter derived from DWI, can reflect water mobility within various tissues according to the pathophysiologic state. In recent years, DWI has been used as part of a routine MRI protocol for bladder examination. Although DWI has proven to be a useful imaging tool to distinguish among benign and malignant lesions and evaluate tumor stage , especially to reduce overstaging rate compared to gadolinium-enhanced imaging , the accuracy in differentiating superficial from invasive tumors is relatively low . In addition, ADC values showed a substantial overlap in low- and high-stage tumors, thus limiting the usefulness of DWI for the individual patient .
