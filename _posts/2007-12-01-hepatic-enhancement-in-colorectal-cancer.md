## Rationale and Objectives

Perfusion imaging of the liver has attracted interest as a potential means for earlier detection of hepatic metastases, but the techniques are complex and do not form part of routine imaging protocols. This study assesses whether the hemodynamic status of the liver of patients with colorectal cancer but apparently normal hepatic morphology is reflected by texture features within a single portal-phase contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) image and correlates texture with overall survival.

## Materials and Methods

Portal-phase CT images from 27 patients with colorectal cancer but no apparent hepatic metastases were processed using a band-pass filter that highlighted image features at different spatial frequencies. A range of parameters reflecting liver texture on filtered images were correlated against CT hepatic perfusion index (HPI) and patient survival.

## Results

After image filtration, entropy values from hepatic regions were inversely correlated with HPI ( _r_ = –0.503978, _P_ = .007355), and directly correlated with survival ( _r_ = 0.489642, _P_ = .009533). An entropy value below 2.0 identified four patients who died within 36 months of their CT scan with sensitivity 100% and specificity 65% ( _P_ < .03).

## Conclusion

The hemodynamic status of the liver is reflected by subtle changes in coarse texture on portal phase images that can be revealed by texture analysis. Texture analysis has the potential to identify colorectal cancer patients with an apparently normal portal phase hepatic CT but reduced survival.

Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in Western societies ( ). Most patients undergo resection of the primary tumor, but up to 40% of these patients will relapse and die of their disease, making colorectal cancer the second leading cause of death related to cancer ( ). In 20%–40% of patients, the liver is the sole site of metastases ( ). It is common practice to follow-up patients after their curative resection but there is wide variation in follow-up strategies. A recent systemic literature review concluded that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow-up of such patients, with imaging of the liver being associated with reduced mortality (odds ratio = 0.66, 95% confidence limits 0.46–0.95) ( ), and the American Society of Clinical Oncology now recommends annual computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen for 3 years after primary therapy for patients at higher risk of recurrence ( ). Current techniques for detection of metastases can be divided into two main categories based on the information used: structural and functional information of the tissue in question. In structural imaging, routine helical CT, CT arterioportography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound are employed. CT scanning is well established and widely available technique and so is the first choice when staging cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging is as sensitive as CT in detecting focal liver lesions, but at present limited access and relatively high costs preclude magnetic resonance imaging as a viable screening test. CT arterioportography was developed to improve detection, definition and differentiate liver metastases from other liver lesions before surgery ( ). It has reported sensitivity of 84%–90% compared with 65% with conventional CT; however, its specificity is poor and it is also an invasive procedure, which exempts it from becoming a general screening technique. Other functional imaging techniques include Doppler and power ultrasound in assessing blood flow changes and nuclear medicine procedures such as fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography used for evaluation of glucose metabolism. These ultrasound techniques are user-dependent, whereas positron emission tomography is relatively complex and expensive with limited availability. Hence CT of the liver is widely employed as a means of diagnosing hepatic metastases during restaging of patients with colorectal cancer.

The detection of hepatic metastases by CT is improved by use of contrast media. Yet, even with contrast enhancement and modern multidetector CT systems, metastases smaller than 5 mm in diameter cannot be detected reliably. Thus perfusion imaging of the liver has attracted interest as a potential means to overcome this shortcoming on the basis that hepatic metastases too small to visualize on conventional images (ie, micrometastases) are associated with alterations in hepatic blood flow ( ).

HPI was calculated using Winfun (University of Cambridge Radiology Department, Cambridge, UK), a PC-based program developed for the determination of CT perfusion parameters for hepatic ROI constructed just within the boundaries of the liver but excluding areas of fat and major blood vessels. Time-attenuation curves were generated for the liver, spleen, and aorta.

where (x, y) is the spatial coordinates of the image matrix and sigma, σ is the standard deviation. The two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian distribution effectively blurs the image, wiping out all structures at scales much smaller than the sigma of the Gaussian. Thus Gaussian distribution would enable highlighting only hepatic textural features of a particular scale in contrast agent–enhanced CT images corresponding to the sigma (σ) value. To assess independently whether liver parenchyma and liver vascularity affect the hemodynamic status of the liver, we have employed this filtration technique to filter out textural features of varying scale: fine scale enhances parenchyma, whereas medium to coarse scale enhances blood vessels of varying sizes. For these reasons, such as selective hepatic feature extraction at a particular scale and reducing the effects of noise, Gaussian smoothening, which suppresses noise and has the desirable characteristics of being smooth and localized in both the spatial and frequency domains, was carried out before actually employing the Laplacian filter, because it is less likely to introduce any changes that were not present in the original image.

From the mathematical expression of this circularly symmetric filter at different sigma (σ) values, the number of pixels representing the width between the diametrically opposite zero-crossing points in this filter can be calculated (see  Fig 5 ). The width of the filter at different sigma (σ) values are obtained by evaluating the LoG spatial distribution along the x and y directions. The higher the sigma value, the higher is the width of the filter in the spatial domain; this corresponds to a smaller pass-band region of the filter in the frequency domain, highlighting coarse features in the filtered image in the spatial domain. Similarly, the lower the sigma value, the smaller is the width of the filter in the spatial domain and the larger is the pass-band region of the filter in the frequency domain, highlighting fine details or features in the filtered image in the spatial domain. Thus the filter can be modulated so as to highlight liver features of a particular size (ie, at known spatial frequencies).  Table 4 indicates the filter width in pixels for a range of sigma values. This width can be considered as the scale at which the structures in the image will be highlighted and enhanced whilst structures below this scale will become blurred. From  Fig 3 , it is clear that fine texture predominantly highlights only liver parenchyma, whereas coarse texture predominantly highlights portal blood vessels.
