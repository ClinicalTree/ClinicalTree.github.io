## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the intratumoral residence time of microbubbles (MBs) targeted to α  v β  3 integrin expressed in the endothelial cells of mice during the process of tumor angiogenesis.

## Materials and Methods

For the preparation of MBs, decafluorobutane gas was sonically dispersed in phosphate buffer saline containing L-A-phosphatidylcholine-distearoyl, polyethylene glycol 40 stearate, and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-\[biotinyl(polyethylene glycol)2000\] in a 77:15:8 molar ratio. Avidin–fluorescein isothiocyanate and biotin–cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate-D-tyrosine-lysine (cRGD) or biotin–alanine-glycine-aspartate (AGD) conjugates were added to the reaction mixture. Adhesion testing of the targeting MBs was performed for the MS-1 cell line expressing α  v β  3 integrin in vitro. The in vivo acoustic properties of the MBs were assessed by clinical ultrasound on the HT1080 fibrosarcoma model ( _n_ = 8) for 1 hour. Cryosections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and by immunohistochemical staining to identify expression of α  v β  3 integrin in the HT1080 tumor.

## Results

The adherence of the MBs conjugated to cRGD was significantly greater than the adherence of the MBs conjugated to biotin-AGD ( _P_ < .01) for the MS-1 endothelial cell line. The acoustic enhancement on ultrasound was observed as a stable imaging window until 1 hour after injection of the MB conjugates in the mice. The MBs targeted via cRGD preferentially adhered to the vascular endothelium of the HT-1080 tumors. The findings of ultrasound imaging were correlated with immunohistochemical findings for the expression of α  v β  3 integrin on the vascular endothelium of the tumors.

## Conclusions

The prepared MBs conjugated with cRGD demonstrated a sufficient residence time to attach to the target integrin of tumor tissues. This finding suggests that the MBs are a potential molecular contrast agent that enables characterization of tumor angiogenesis and the monitoring of antitumor and antiangiogenic therapy.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a recently developed imaging technique in which microbubbles (MBs) enable improved contrast between blood vessels and the surrounding tissue during ultrasound imaging. Several studies have recently been performed for MB-specific applications, including tissue-specific reticuloendothelial system imaging , molecular targeting imaging , drug delivery and gene therapy . Several academic and industrial research groups with different animal models have shown the successful use of targeted ultrasound contrast agents for qualitative ultrasound-based imaging.

Angiogenesis is a critical determinant of tumor growth, invasion, and metastatic potential. Specific endothelial molecular markers of angiogenesis are expressed in the tumor vasculature. Alpha  v β  3 integrin is well known as an adhesion protein, which is upregulated in activated endothelial cells such as the cells in the neovasculature within ischemic tissue and tumors. Therefore, detection of α  v β  3 integrin expression in tumor neovessels may be useful because this integrin appears to have a functional role in angiogenesis , and it has been implicated as a marker of the metastatic potential and of poor prognosis . Some studies have reported that tumor angiogenesis could be assessed with the use of ultrasound imaging and contrast agents targeted to integrins .
