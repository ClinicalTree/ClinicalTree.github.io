In the introduction to _The Human Brain in 1492 Pieces_ , neurosurgeon and neuromicroanatomist Dr Albert L. Rhoton, Jr. accurately describes this interactive CD-ROM as “the future of brain atlases.” The challenge of neuroanatomy is that the brain, composed largely of structures nested within other structures, does not lend itself well to three-dimensional illustrations. Consequently, traditional brain atlases have relied heavily on slice anatomy, sacrificing the three-dimensional relationships that are so important for spatial understanding. _The Human Brain_ attempts to overcome this obstacle by using three-dimensional computer modeling to make an interactive atlas that the viewer can manipulate at will.

_The Human Brain in 1492 Pieces_ is the commercial product descendent of the prototype presented at the 2009 Radiological Society of North America meeting and recipient of the Magna Cum Laude Award. It contains a three-dimensional rendering of the brain that was generated from multiple 3-T and 7-T magnetic resonance imaging exams of a single subject, the author. Resolution is excellent, with voxel sizes of 0.8 mm  3 , and it is clear that great effort was made to ensure that the relationships of fine structures were kept accurate in the process of merging scans and illustrating structures.

When the program is launched, the brain, Nowinski’s brain, appears facing the viewer, eyes included. Gyri are color coded with deep hues, and there is a complex web of red arteries and blue veins covering its surface. There are button controls to the side for zooming, panning, or rotating the brain in any combination of planes or reverting to six standard views. The model of the brain is divided into brain parenchyma, arteries, veins, and white matter tracts, as well as numerous substructures for each. These are all listed to the side with checkboxes that allow the viewer to hide them one by one and one side at a time. The arteries and veins are hidden by unchecking their boxes, leaving a standard three-dimensional view of the brain. Slide the bar labeled “axial,” and the brain melts away from top to bottom, revealing white matter tracts spouting out of a T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance image like fountains. Melting can be done in sagittal or coronal planes as well. Hover the mouse over a tract, and a label appears. Alternatively, hide all of the structures and turn the right-side arteries on one by one, watching the internal carotid artery branch into a complex tree of fine arteries. Follow each limb with the mouse to see the names. High-resolution images can be saved at any time.

Vascular anatomy is the clear focus of the content of _The Human Brain_ . There are 1300 vessels with labels that include diameter measurements to 0.01-mm precision. White matter tracts are noteworthy and await the widespread clinical use of diffusion tensor imaging. Parenchymal structures, excluding cortical gyri, are relatively ignored; hover over the superior colliculus or pons and “Brainstem” appears. Labels are also strangely absent from the superimposed magnetic resonance images.

Computer hardware is an issue with _The Human Brain_ . The program must be installed, and the original CD-ROM must be in the drive to run the program. The window is designed for the retiring 4:3 aspect ratio and is not resizable, so the bottom of the window was clipped from view on a laptop with the current 16:9 ratio. The program is listed as Windows compatible only; Mac users need not apply.

Overall, _The Human Brain_ is a step into the future of brain atlases because its infinitely adjustable viewing controls allow the user to focus on the topic of interest and selectively hide extraneous detail. Its focus on vascular anatomy and, to a lesser degree, white matter tracts suggests that the target audience is more likely to be neurosurgeons or neurointerventionalists with aspirations of professional-quality, color-coded three-dimensional illustrations. Radiologists looking to learn neuroanatomy will be less well served.
