## Rationale and Objectives

To examine the feasibility of and satisfaction with a tailored web-based intervention designed to decrease radiologists’ recommendation of inappropriate additional work-up after a screening mammogram.

## Materials and Methods

We developed a web-based educational intervention designed to reduce inappropriate recall. Radiologists were randomly assigned to participate in an early intervention group or a late (control) intervention group, the latter of which served as a control for a 9-month follow-up period, after which they were invited to participate in the intervention. Intervention content was derived from our prior research and included three modules: 1) an introduction to audit statistics for mammography performance; 2) a review of data showing radiologists’ inflated perceptions of medical malpractice risks related to breast imaging, and 3) a review of data on breast cancer risk among women seen in their practices. Embedded within the intervention were individualized audit data for each participating radiologists obtained from the national Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

## Results

Seventy-four radiologists (37.8%; 74/196) consented to the intervention, which was completed by 67.5% (27/40) of those randomized to the early intervention group and 41.2% (14/34) of those randomized to the late (control) group. Thus, a total of 41 (55%) completed the intervention. On average, three log-ins were used to complete the program (range 1–14), which took approximately 1 hour. Ninety-five percent found the program moderately to very helpful in understanding how to calculate basic performance measures. Ninety-three percent found viewing their own performance measures moderately to very helpful, and 83% reported it being moderately to very important to learn that the breast cancer risk in their screening population program was lower than perceived. The percentage of radiologists who reported that the risk of medical malpractice influences their recall rates dropped from 36.3% preintervention to 17.8% after intervention with a similar drop in perceived influence of malpractice risk on their recommendations for breast biopsy (36.4 to 17.3%). More than 75% of radiologists answered the postintervention knowledge questions correctly, and the percent of time spent in breast imaging did not appear to influence responses. The majority (>92%) of participants correctly responded that the target recall rate in the United States is 9%. The mean self-reported recall rates were 13.0 for radiologists spending <40% time in breast imaging and 14.9% for those spending >40% time spent in breast imaging, which was highly correlated with their actual recall rates (0.991; _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Radiologists who begin an internet-based tailored intervention designed to help reduce unnecessary recall will likely complete it, although only 55% who consented to the study actually undertook the intervention. Participants found the program useful in helping them understand why their recall rates may be elevated.

Several studies have shown that variability in recall rates in mammography screening is extensive (7% to 17%), even among high-volume readers . Similarly, recall rates in the United States are nearly twice as high as those reported in other countries with comparable cancer detection rates . Studies have not fully explained the reasons for high recall rates in the United States . However, the 1992 Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) sought to improve the practice of mammography in the United States using a required system to track outcomes associated with mammograms that resulted in a recommendation for biopsy. MQSA requires that each facility track pathology outcomes when biopsy is recommended on the basis of mammography but does not require the tracking of clinical outcomes when additional imaging is recommended . Rather, in the United States, approaches used to implement tracking systems and reviews of additional audit data are left to the discretion of each mammography facility .

Very little research has focused on whether auditing systems alone affect recall rates or improve performance. A recent observational study found that among 255 radiologists across the United States who completed a survey about medical audits, 91% reported receiving individualized audit reports (in a paper format), which were provided by mammography registries participating in the National Cancer Institute funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) . In addition, of these 255 radiologists, 83% reported paying close attention to their audit numbers, 87% found the reports valuable, and 75% felt that audit reports prompted them to improve interpretative performance. However, how radiologists use audit data to determine how their performance can be improved is not known.
