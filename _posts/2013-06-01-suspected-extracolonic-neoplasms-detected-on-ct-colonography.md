## Rationale and Objectives

This study summarizes the literature on the detection of cancer among indeterminate extracolonic findings on computed tomographic (CT) colonography in five targeted organs.

## Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed for English-language literature published between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 2010. We describe extracolonic findings in the kidney, lung, liver, pancreas, and ovary suspect for malignancy as they are associated with high mortality. For each organ, we calculated the median prevalence, positive predictive value (PPV), and false positive rate of malignancy and a pooled false-positive rate across studies.

## Results

Of 91 publications initially identified, 24 were eligible for review. Indeterminate renal masses on CT colonography had 20.5% median PPV and low pooled false positive rate of 1.3% (95% confidence interval 0.6–2.0). In contrast, indeterminate masses of the lung, liver, pancreas, and ovary had low PPV (median values ranged from 0% to 3.8%). Indeterminate masses of the ovary resulted in the highest pooled false-positive rate of 2.2%. Results were similar in studies of both screening and nonscreening populations. We estimated the probability of false positive results through the detection of significant extracolonic findings as 46 per 1000 for men and 68 per 1000 for women.

## Conclusions

Indeterminate renal masses newly detected on CT colonography have an estimated one in five chance of malignancy and therefore warrant further follow-up to provide a definitive diagnosis. Conversely, indeterminate masses of the lung, liver, pancreas, and ovary are associated with high false positive rates and merit more conservative clinical follow-up.

Computed tomographic (CT) colonography was first described as a method to assess colon neoplasia in 1994 . CT colonography involves insufflation of the colon and rectum with gas and the acquisition of thin-section CT images to visualize polyps and masses using both two-dimensional and three-dimensional interpretation . Multiple studies have demonstrated that the accuracy of CT colonography is similar to that of traditional (optical) colonoscopy for the detection of adenomas and colorectal cancer (ie, sensitivity of 91.3% and specificity of 93.1% for lesions >5 mm) . Both of these screening techniques require cathartic bowel preparation, which is a major deterrent to colorectal cancer screening for patients. However, because CT colonography does not require sedation, it has the potential to increase overall adherence to colorectal cancer screening and is associated with fewer risks than optical colonoscopy.

Unlike traditional colonoscopy, CT colonography can identify extracolonic findings (ie, outside the colon or rectal lumen) because the lung bases, abdomen, and pelvis are included in the examination. To guide management of extracolonic findings, the Working Group on Virtual Colonoscopy developed a rating of extracolonic findings using a scale of E1 to E4 . Under this system, E3 and E4 findings are potentially significant to the patient's health but incompletely characterized on CT colonography and usually require further imaging and medical follow-up for definitive characterization. E3 findings (eg, pulmonary nodules <1 cm or cystic renal or adnexal masses) are likely insignificant and might require nonurgent follow-up. E4 findings (eg, solid renal masses or pulmonary nodules >1 cm) are likely significant and require urgent follow-up.
