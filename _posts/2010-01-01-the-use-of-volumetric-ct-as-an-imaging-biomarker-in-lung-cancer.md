## Rationale and Objectives

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Mortality outcomes have improved only modestly over the past 30 years. There is intense focus on the development of better treatments for lung cancer. Major issues include the cost and time duration of the clinical trials required to establish the utility of a drug so that it can be formally approved by regulatory agencies. In clinical settings, biomarkers that accelerate assessments of responses to treatment could benefit patients by providing earlier diagnoses of progressive disease, particularly when there are multiple options for treatment, and the effects of toxicity from one treatment tend to limit the ability to administer the next line of therapy.

## Materials and Methods

Quantifying longitudinal changes in tumor volumes using computed tomography could eventually become a more useful surrogate endpoint for assessing tumor responses or progression events than simple unidimensional measurements.

## Results

The authors review the historical development of response measurements in lung cancer, set out the medical context for specifying volumetric imaging requirements and goals, compare volumetric technique to conventional methods, and identify the imaging profiles being pursued.

## Conclusion

The Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance is investigating volumetric computed tomographic acquisition and analytic methods to increase the analytic power per subject enrolled in clinical trials to reduce the number of total subjects needed or shorten the length of time an individual needs to be followed to reliably establish drug response.

Computed tomographic imaging technology has continued to improve over the past three decades . The benefits of imaging for diagnosis, staging, and restaging cancer are now well established . However, assessing responses to treatment has remained predominantly qualitative, with limited use of electronic caliper measurements of unidimensional or bidimensional line lengths on a single two-dimensional image slice. Anecdotal evidence continues to emerge suggesting that line-length measurements may be misleading compared to volumetric measurements of the tumor mass. However, early attempts to quantify entire tumor volumes proved to be labor intensive and not adequately reproducible . More recent attempts have been encouraging , but additional studies are needed for future consideration as an acceptable imaging endpoint by regulatory authorities.

This report outlines the initial clinical emphasis of the Volumetric CT Technical Committee of the Radiological Society of North America's (RSNA) Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA). The potential benefits of the effort are described, the roles of each of the stakeholders are explained, and a staged approach for moving the process forward is explained.

![Figure 1, Volume measurements could be both more sensitive and more specific than unidimensional line lengths placed on a single slice. ( a ) A patient with lung cancer before treatment; ( c ) corresponding image 3 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Boundaries and longest diameters were computed automatically. The change in the line lengths representing the longest diameter between (A) (40.8 mm) and (C) (39.3 mm) is 3.8%. ( b,d ) Corresponding surface rendering of the entire tumor mass in question. The baseline volume was 16,336 mm 3 . The volume after 3 weeks of treatment was 11,500 mm 3 , a decrease of 29.6%. In this case, even visual inspection of the conventional images indicates that the contraction of the tumor in response to treatment was not uniform; estimation of the longest diameter ignores more pronounced changes in other directions.
