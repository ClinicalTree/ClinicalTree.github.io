## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this work is to determine if the speed of sound value of a breast cyst can aid in the clinical management of breast masses. Breast macrocysts are defined as fluid-filled tissue masses >1 cm in diameter and are thought to be aberrations of normal development and involution, often associated with apocrine metaplasia. The benign natural history of breast cysts is well known, and it is important to obtain high specificity in breast imaging to avoid unnecessary biopsies in women who have benign diseases, particularly those with dense breast tissue. Transmission ultrasound is a tomographic imaging modality that generates high-resolution, 3D speed of sound maps that could be used to identify breast tissue types and act as a biomarker to differentiate lesions. We performed this study to investigate the microanatomy of macrocysts observed using transmission ultrasound, as well as assess the relationship of speed of sound to the physical and biochemical parameters of cyst fluids.

## Materials and Methods

Cyst fluid samples were obtained from 37 patients as part of a case-collection study for ultrasound imaging of the breast. The speed of sound of each sample was measured using a quantitative transmission ultrasound scanner in vivo. Electrolytes, protein, cholesterol, viscosity, and specific gravity were also measured (in the aspirated cyst fluid) to assess their relationship to the speed of sound values obtained during breast imaging.

## Results

We found positive correlations between viscosity and cholesterol ( _r_ = 0.71) and viscosity and total protein × cholesterol ( _r_ = 0.78). Additionally, we performed direct cell counts on cyst fluids and confirmed a positive correlation of number of cells with speed of sound ( _r_ = 0.74). The speed of sound of breast macrocysts, as observed using transmission ultrasound, correlated with the cytological features of intracystic cell clumps.

## Conclusion

On the basis of our work with speed as a classifier, we propose a spectrum of breast macrocysts from fluid-filled to highly cellular. Our results suggest high-speed cysts are mature macrocysts with high cell counts and many cellular clumps that correlate with cyst microanatomy as seen by transmission ultrasound. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to assess the clinical value of speed of sound measurements in breast imaging using transmission ultrasound.

## INTRODUCTION

## Biology of Breast Cysts

The normal breast consists of segments (lobes) drained by collecting ducts. The segments consist of lobules composed of terminal ducts, acini and their supporting stroma ( ). Breast macrocysts are reviewed by Hughes and are defined as fluid-filled tissue masses >1 cm in diameter ( ). They were first described in 1829 and are thought to be aberrations of normal development and involution, often associated with apocrine metaplasia ( ). Macrocysts are seen in 21% of women at postmortem and in over 10,000 breast biopsies for benign disease of which 23% had macrocysts ( ). Cysts are manifestations of lobular involution and their origin from the breast lobule has been demonstrated using histochemical techniques ( ). They are usually lined by a single layer of epithelium which has proteins found only in apocrine epithelium ( ). Evidence that active secretion is responsible for cyst formation has come from analysis of cyst fluid ( ). The benign natural history of breast cysts is well known in these women with a low incidental risk for cancer ( ). Thus, it is important to have high specificity in breast imaging to avoid unnecessary biopsies in women who have benign diseases, particularly in those women with dense breast tissue ( ).

## Transmission Ultrasound

Quantitative transmission (QT) ultrasound is an imaging modality based on tomographic techniques extended to ultrasound. In such a system, images are generated using both reflection and transmission techniques. While transmission ultrasound has been investigated as an adjunct to mammography for quite some time, recent developments in hardware and imaging algorithms have enabled marked improvements in spatial resolution and clinical utility ( ). Physically, a transmitter and receiver pair is colocated with multiple reflection transducers with various focal lengths in a U-shaped arrangement ( ). The transmitter emits a plane wave that is received by the receiver with multiple acquisitions at frequencies ranging from 300 kHz to 1.5 MHz as the U-channel is rotated 360° around the subject. Once acquired, the projection information is reconstructed using nonlinear inverse scattering in 3D ( ). The result of this reconstruction is a quantitative volume map of speed of sound (measured at 1.5 MHz), with units of meters per second (m/s). In reflection ultrasound imaging, each of the three reflection transducers (4 MHz center frequency) with different focal lengths are alternately fired between transmission measurements in a B-mode acquisition. The resulting images are compounded together and corrected for refraction using the speed map computed in the transmission phase. This compounding produces a nonquantitative image that is proportional to impedance mismatch, referred to simply as reflection units (RUs). The result of each scan is a 3D volume of speed and reflection. These image stacks are precisely coregistered since they are acquired at the same time, so they can be put together to form a 3D view of the object in the field of view. The imaging system can image human breast tissue anatomy with high spatial and contrast resolution, while the speed of sound information corresponds well with tissue specificity ( ).
