## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a MicroDose photon-counting full-field digital mammography (PCM) system in comparison to full-field digital mammography (FFDM) for area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and feature analysis of standard-view mammography for women presenting for screening mammography, diagnostic mammography, or breast biopsy.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 133 women were enrolled in this study at two European medical centers, with 67 women who had a pre-existing 10–36 months FFDM enrolled prospectively into the study and 66 women who underwent breast biopsy and had screening PCM and diagnostic FFDM, including standard craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views of the breast with the lesion, enrolled retrospectively. The case mix consisted of 49 cancers, 17 biopsy-benign cases, and 67 normal cases. Sixteen radiologists participated in the reader study and interpreted all 133 cases in both conditions, separated by washout period of ≥4 weeks. ROC curve and free-response ROC curve analyses were performed for noninferiority of PCM compared to FFDM using a noninferiority margin Δ value of 0.10. Feature analysis of the 66 cases with lesions was conducted with all 16 readers at the conclusion of the blinded reads. Mean glandular dose was recorded for all cases.

## Results

The AUC for PCM was 0.947 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.920–0.974) and for FFDM was 0.931 (95% CI, 0.898–0.964). Sensitivity per case for PCM was 0.936 (95% CI, 0.897–0.976) and for FFDM was 0.908 (95% CI, 0.856–0.960). Specificity per case for PCM was 0.764 (95% CI, 0.688–0.841) and for FFDM was 0.749 (95% CI, 0.668–0.830). Free-response ROC curve figures of merit were 0.920 (95% CI, 0.881–0.959) and 0.903 (95% CI, 0.858–0.948) for PCM and FFDM, respectively. Sensitivity per lesion was 0.903 (95% CI, 0.846–0.960) and 0.883 (95% CI, 0.823–0.944) for PCM and FFDM, respectively. The average false-positive marks per image of noncancer cases were 0.265 (95% CI, 0.171–0.359) and 0.281 (95% CI, 0.188–0.374) for PCM and FFDM, respectively. Noninferiority _P_ values for AUC, sensitivity (per case and per lesion), specificity, and average false-positive marks per image were all statistically significant ( _P_ < .001). The noninferiority _P_ value for free-response ROC was <.025, from the 95% CI for the difference. Feature analysis resulted in PCM being preferred to FFDM by the readers for ≥70% of the cases. The average mean glandular dose for PCM was 0.74 mGy (95% CI, 0.722–0.759 mGy) and for FFDM was 1.23 mGy (95% CI, 1.199–1.262 mGy).

## Conclusions

In this study, radiologist performance with PCM was not inferior to that with conventional FFDM at an average 40% lower mean glandular dose.

Several published studies have demonstrated that digital mammography systems have significantly lower doses than screen-film mammography, with the slot-scanning systems having the lowest doses at comparable exposures across all breast densities. Although numerous technologies have been used for breast cancer screening, the gold standard since the late 1970s has been x-ray-based mammography . Technological advancements have led to monumental improvements in the detection and diagnostic accuracy of mammography in the past 30 years, culminating in the introduction and dissemination of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in the past 10 years.

The transition to digital mammography was brought about by the desire to improve the sensitivity of x-ray mammography and decrease the amount of unnecessary radiation exposure that was experienced in film mammographic acquisition, especially in women with dense breasts. In the Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST), the diagnostic accuracy of digital and film systems was shown to be comparable, with digital mammography showing improved performance over film mammography for women with dense breasts, those aged <50 years, and those who were premenopausal or perimenopausal . Digital mammography systems tested in DMIST on average had a 22% lower mean glandular dose (MGD) than screen-film mammography systems used in DMIST . The slot-scanning FFDM system had the lowest MGD in comparison to screen-film mammography. Slot-scanning systems have been shown to have lower MGDs than conventional screen-film mammography systems . The photon-counting FFDM (PCM) system combines photon counting for high detective quantum efficiency with scanning multislit technology for efficient scatter rejection. A potential for 40% to 60% dose reduction with maintained physical image quality has been reported for the system . The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a PCM system in comparison to conventional FFDM.
