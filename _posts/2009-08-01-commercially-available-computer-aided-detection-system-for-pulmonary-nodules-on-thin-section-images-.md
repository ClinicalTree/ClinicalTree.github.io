## Rationale and Objectives

Most studies of computer-aided detection (CAD) for pulmonary nodules have focused on solid nodule detection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a commercially available CAD system in the detection of pulmonary nodules with or without ground-glass opacity (GGO) using 64-detector-row computed tomography compared to visual interpretation.

## Materials and Methods

Computed tomographic examinations were performed on 48 patients with existing or suspicious pulmonary nodules on chest radiography. Three radiologists independently reported the location and pattern (GGO, solid, or part solid) of each nodule candidate on computed tomographic scans, assigned each a confidence score, and then analyzed all scans using the CAD system. A reference standard was established by a consensus panel of different radiologists, who found 229 noncalcified nodules with diameters ≥ 4 mm. True-positive and false-positive results and confidence levels were used to generate jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic plots.

## Results

The sensitivity of GGO for 3 radiologists (60%–80%) was significantly higher than that for the CAD system (21%) (McNemar's test, _P_ < .0001). For overall and solid nodules, the figure-of-merit values without and with the CAD system were significantly different ( _P_ = .005–.04) on jackknife alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic analysis. For GGO and part-solid nodules, the figure-of-merit values with the CAD system were greater than those without the CAD system, indicating no significant differences.

## Conclusion

Radiologists are significantly superior to this CAD system in the detection of GGO, but the CAD system can still play a complementary role in detecting nodules with or without GGO.

The accurate identification of pulmonary nodules is essential for the diagnosis of various pathologic conditions. The recent development of multi-detector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has made it possible to acquire thin-slice images of the whole lung within one breath hold. Thin-slice images enable the detection of small pulmonary nodules that are ambiguous or not visible on thick-slice images . However, it is a well-known problem that false-negative diagnoses are caused by perceptual errors or misinterpretations by radiologists . To reduce the incidence of false-negative diagnoses, double reading has been recommended . It has been reported that the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) as the second reader improves nodule detection on chest radiography or computed tomography and is especially useful in routine clinical settings because of limited human resources.

Generally, pulmonary nodules can be classified into three categories on the basis of the internal density of the nodules: solid, localized ground-glass opacity (GGO), and part solid nodule. Solid nodules are characterized by high contrast on computed tomography, localized GGO is characterized by a hazy increase in lung attenuation that does not obscure the underlying vascular markings , and part-solid nodules exhibit the characteristics of both solid nodules and localized GGO. However, most studies of CAD for pulmonary nodules have focused on solid nodule detection.
