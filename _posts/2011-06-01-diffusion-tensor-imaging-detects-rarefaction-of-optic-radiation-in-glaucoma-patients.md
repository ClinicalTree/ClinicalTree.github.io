## Rationale and Objectives

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can depict rarefaction of the optical fibres. Hence, we applied DTI to assess pathological changes of the optic radiation in glaucoma patients.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty glaucoma patients and 50 healthy age-matched controls were examined by a 3T high-field magnetic resonance scanner. Fiber tracts were volume rendered using a semiquantitative approach to assess rarefaction and results were correlated with the extent of optic nerve atrophy and reduced spatial-temporal contrast sensitivity of the retina using established ophthalmological examinations.

## Results

Twenty-two glaucoma patients (44%) showed significant rarefaction of the optic radiation: the volume was reduced to 67 ± 16% compared with controls. Hereby, the glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy stage correlated with the presence of DTI-derived rarefied optic radiation (Kendall tau-b 0.272, _P_ = .016). Aside, cerebral microangiopathy affecting the optic radiation was significantly higher among glaucoma patients compared to controls (10 patients compared with 2 patients, _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

In patients with glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, there is anterograde and—most likely because of microangiopathic lesions within the optic radiation—retrograde transneuronal rarefaction of the optic radiation that can be assessed in vivo using DTI with good correlation to established ophthalmological examinations.

Transneuronal degeneration is a process of primary neuron injury affecting the linked distal neurons. It was described for pathophysiological changes in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease and brain trauma . More recent studies have suggested that this damage also occurs in the development of glaucoma .

Loss of ganglion cells in the retina (first and second neuron of the visual pathway) and their axons representing the optic nerve (third neuron) and a loss of astrocytes is, because of an increased intraocular pressure, the predominant finding in glaucoma. The axons of various retinal ganglion cell subtypes, differing in specific morphology and function, exit the eye ball, and finally converge to anatomically distinguishable layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) where a loss of neural cells has also been described for glaucoma . The LGN serves as a relay station transmitting the information via the optic radiation (fourth neuron of the visual pathway) to the primary visual cortex .

(a) In both eyes (OS [left] > OD [right]) the automated perimeter showed predominantly superior visual field defects due to a loss of axons of the 3rd neuron. (b) The frequency doubling test indicated impaired spatial-temporal contrast sensitivity primarily in OS in the superior and temporal area as well as nasal near the center. (c) Typical signs of glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy were recorded by a non-mydriatic fundus camera that is in OS a small rim area, smaller inferior rim than temporal and a parapapillary bleeding (arrows). (d) DTI shows intact optic radiation in a healthy 67-year-old woman without any visual disturbances.

![Figure 2, Generalized microangiopathy was coexistent with optic nerve head damage in 30 of 49 patients. Here, 10 patients showed remarkable microangiopathic lesions within the optic radiation (8 patients with glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy and 2 patients with nonglaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, respectively) and DTI revealed rarefication of the optic radiation in 8 of these 10 patients. An example is given in (a) and (b) (T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR] sequence).
