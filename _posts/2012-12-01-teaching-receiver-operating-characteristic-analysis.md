## Rationale and Objectives

Despite its fundamental importance in the evaluation of diagnostic tests, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is not easily understood. The purpose of this project was to create a learning experience that resulted in an intuitive understanding of the basic principles of ROC analysis.

## Materials and Methods

An interactive laboratory exercise was developed for a class about radiology testing taught within a clinical epidemiology course between 2000 and 2009. The physician students in the course were clinical fellows from various medical specialties who were enrolled in a graduate degree program in clinical investigation. For the exercise, the class was divided into six groups. Each group interpreted radiographs from a set of 50 exams of the peripheral skeleton to determine the presence or absence of an acute fracture. Data from the class were pooled and given to each student. Students calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) corresponding to overall class performance. A binormal ROC curve was also fitted to the data from each class year.

## Results

The laboratory exercise was conducted for 8 years with approximately 20–30 students per year. The mean AUC over the eight laboratory classes was 0.72 with a standard deviation of 0.08 (range, 0.60–0.85).

## Conclusion

With some simplifications in design, an observer study can be conducted in a laboratory classroom setting. Participatory data collection promotes the intuitive understanding of ROC analysis principles.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is an established statistical method in the evaluation of diagnostic tests . In the clinical laboratory, ROC curves are typically constructed from numerical test results collected from a number of patients. The ROC curve shows all the possible sensitivity/specificity pairs that result from all possible cutoff values between normal and abnormal.

Radiology exams represent a type of medical test that usually does not produce a numerical result. Instead, the typical clinical question has a binomial purpose: to determine the presence or absence of a particular diagnosis. However, the interpretation of radiology exams often involves uncertainty. If we express this uncertainty on an ordinal scale, then we have data that are amenable to ROC analysis.
