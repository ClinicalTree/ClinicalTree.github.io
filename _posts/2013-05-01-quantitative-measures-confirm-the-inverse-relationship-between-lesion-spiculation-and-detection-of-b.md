## Objective

To identify specific mammographic appearances that reduce the mammographic detection of breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

This study received institutional board review approval and all readers gave informed consent. A set of 60 mammograms each consisting of craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique projections were presented to 129 mammogram Breastscreen readers. The images consisted of 20 positive cases with single and multicentric masses in 16 and 4 cases, respectively (resulting in a total of 24 cancers), and readers were asked to identify and locate the lesions. Each lesion was then ranked according to a detectability rating (ie, the number of observers who correctly located the lesion divided by the total number of observers), and this was correlated with breast density, lesion size, and various descriptors of lesion shape and texture.

## Results

Negative and positive correlations between lesion detection and density ( _r_ = −0.64, _P_ = .007) and size ( _r_ = 0.65, _P_ = .005), respectively, were demonstrated. In terms of lesion size and shape, there were significant correlations between the probability of detection and area ( _r_ = 0.43, _P_ = .04), perimeter ( _r_ = 0.66, _P_ = .0004), lesion elongation ( _r_ = 0.49, _P_ = .02), and lesion nonspiculation ( _r_ = 0.78, _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

The results of this study have identified specific lesion characteristics associated with shape that may contribute to reduced cancer detection. Mammographic sensitivity may be adversely affected without appropriate attention to spiculation.

The detection of breast masses on mammograms is a difficult task for human observers or machines . The heterogeneity and potential variability of normal breast tissue often produce a number of localized findings that may simulate mass lesions or, depending on the observer, create distractions during the search process . Strategies must therefore be developed to ensure a reasonable performance in detection, and these should include the identification of lesion or image features that make the detection of the cancer more difficult. Such features could be lesion-specific such as size, shape, texture and local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or image-specific such as mammographic breast density and global SNR.

Even though incorrect radiographic positioning or exposure may be considered a principal culprit for missing cancers in mammography , previous findings suggest that a comprehensive investigation of other features is required . Bird and Majid and their colleagues found that missed cancers on mammograms tend to occur in denser breasts and with lesions that present as developing densities. Other authors found that the missed cancers were significantly lower in density and were smaller in size compared to those lesions more easily detected. The previous work implies that attenuation properties of the normal and abnormal structures within the breast can affect detection of disease; however, there are few data on the impact of other image radiographic appearances of disease such as overall lesion morphology and texture . This is surprising because radiologically, shape features of cancers such as spiculations are commonly used to differentiate between malignant and benign lesions and provide an indicator of the aggressiveness of an invasive tumor . Shape characteristics for sublesion elements, such as calcified regions, are well reported and details on calcification morphology, texture, area, perimeter, and elongation have been used to good effect in designing computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithms . Unfortunately, a large number of cancers present as mass lesions without calcifications .
