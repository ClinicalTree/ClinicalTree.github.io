Within only weeks after Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen wrote his papers about discovering x-rays, many physicians were intrigued at the new device that produced internal images and also had the effect of penetrating, exposing, and curing skin cancers and arthritis. Within just a few months after doctors began using x-rays, some of them noticed harm to segments of their anatomy and induced cancers in a total lack of x-ray protection from the use of unshielded x-ray-generating gas tubes.

In 1913, the first shielded medical x-ray devices, the Coolidge tubes from General Electric, offered shelter to physicians and technicians performing patient examinations and x-ray treatments. And, in addition to shielded tubes, most radiologists used lead-lined aprons and shields to protect themselves. Adjustable collimators and the availability of lead shields draped on patients also contributed to the safety of radiologists and patients. A lot of doctors who bought x-ray units and used them without any training in performance and safety precautions contributed to the harm of the population. Fewer physicians were able to obtain tiny amounts of radium and extracted radon gas and treat cancer patients with them.

It was largely after World War II that most doctors began applying artificial radioisotopes for both diagnoses and malignant treatments. The 1950s saw a bit of turf struggle regarding the question of whether isotope use was part of radiology or, as some others argued, a separate discipline, not part of any broader discipline. Mostly, but not entirely, the American Board of Radiology and major x-ray societies prevailed. And by the mid-1960s, technetium-99m was the most acceptable artificial isotope.

In 1961, I was hired by the American College of Radiology and learned that one of its devoted efforts was to preach theÂ gospel to radiologists, or anyone else in medicine, of understanding and exercise x-ray protection. Part of my assignment was to develop public information to the effect that medical x-ray procedures are greatly valuable and should be performed carefully by physicians trained to exercise safety.

When ultrasound came into medicine in the 1970s, some of you wondered about what harm ultrasound exposure could cause patients and doctors and technologists. Seemingly, there was a fairly broad acceptance that ultrasound exposure was not harmful. So it became the new device for fetal monitoring.

But about the same time, computed tomography made a spectacular beginning and reawakened concerns about radiation exposure. Now, decades later, when computed tomographic scanning accounts for almost one in five imaging procedures, the cumulative patient exposures amount to an estimated 48% of all medical x-rays.
