_Ultrasound-Guided Procedures_ is a good source of information for radiologists in training who are learning how to perform ultrasound-guided procedures and for practicing radiologists who may want to acquaint themselves with the performance of a procedure not encountered during radiology training.

The book is divided into four sections (ultrasound-guided biopsies, ultrasound-guided access and drainage, ultrasound-guided percutaneous therapy, and sonohysterography). Chapters in the ultrasound-guided biopsies section include chapters describing how to perform ultrasound-guided biopsies of the liver, kidney, breast, thyroid, and lymph nodes, as well as chapters dedicated to endovaginal procedures and transrectal prostate biopsy. Chapters in the ultrasound-guided access and drainage section include chapters on vascular access; the placement of percutaneous nephrostomy, cholecystostomy, and cystostomy tubes; and paracentesis, thoracentesis, and musculoskeletal joint interventions.

The ultrasound-guided percutaneous therapy section includes chapters on thermal ablation of liver and renal lesions, percutaneous sclerosis of vascular malformations, and management of postcatheterization pseudoaneurysms. The sonohysterography section contains a single chapter on sonohysterography.

Each chapter is written by an experienced interventionalist. The chapter authors walk the reader through the performance of each procedure in a step-by-step fashion. Indications, contraindications, preprocedural evaluation, equipment, technique, postprocedural evaluation, and potential complications and their management are discussed for each procedure. The information provided is quite detailed, including suggestions for needle size and specifics on the types of prophylactic antibiotics to use and their doses, when appropriate. Scattered throughout the book are a few very detailed suggestions clearly gleaned from years of experience, such as how to minimize blood in thyroid fine needle aspirates.

The vast majority of the chapters are very well illustrated, with abundant annotated ultrasound images showing how each procedure is performed in a step-by-step fashion. Cartoon drawings are provided alongside many of the ultrasound images and are used effectively to clarify the ultrasound images. The reader will likely feel as if he or she has adequate knowledge to perform the more simple procedures (eg, solid organ biopsies, fluid collection drainages) after reading this book. However, the relative paucity of annotated illustrations in the musculoskeletal joint interventions chapter stands out as a relative weakness of the book. The reader may have to look for other sources if he or she wants to learn how to do some of the musculoskeletal procedures described. Also, specifics of machinery operation for the thermal ablation chapters were beyond the scope of this book.

This book is a great, up-to-date resource for residents who are learning how to perform ultrasound-guided procedures and want a reference text. However, a relative weakness of the book for residents is that because it covers ultrasound-guided procedures only, it would need to be supplemented by other procedural resources for a given rotation. For example, although a chapter is devoted to ultrasound-guided breast biopsies, techniques for needle localization and stereotactic breast biopsy are not covered.
