## Rationale and Objectives

Medical imaging education often has limited representation in formal medical student curricula. Although the need for _greater_ inclusion of radiology material is generally agreed on, the exact skillset that should be taught is less clear. The purpose of our study was to perform a needs assessment for a national radiology curriculum for medical students.

## Materials and Methods

We analyzed data from previous unpublished portions of the American College of Radiology/Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology survey of Deans and Radiology Chairs regarding prevalence of radiology curricular revisions, assessment tools, use of the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, and resources used in curriculum revision. We also performed a literature search through both PubMED and a general search engine (Google) to identify available resources for designing and implementing imaging curricula and curricular revisions.

## Results

Medical school deans and chairs reported a need for more overall radiology content; one of every six programs (15%) reported they had no recognized imaging curriculum. Of schools currently _with_ imaging curricula, 82% have undergone revision in the last 10 years using a variety of different resources, but there is no universally agreed on guide or standard curriculum. The PubMED and Google searches identified only 23 and eight resources, respectively, suggesting a sizable deficit in available guidance; however, a single published medical student radiology curriculum is available through the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology.

## Conclusions

There is a need, but few available resources, to guide educators in adding imaging content to medical school curricula. We postulate that a standardized national curriculum directed by a focused skillset may be useful to educators and could result in greater uniformity of imaging skills among graduating US medical students. A proposed skillset to guide a national curriculum in radiology is described.

Medical imaging has become a critical component of modern medical practice and diagnosis; however, imaging curricula in medical school education have not evolved at an equivalent pace. Medical imaging education, especially that emphasizing appropriate use of examinations has barely penetrated student training, raising the question as to whether US medical schools are adequately preparing students to be safe and efficient practitioners of evidence-based imaging . The recent American College of Radiology (ACR)/Alliance of Medical School Educators in Radiology (AMSER) white paper on the status of medical imaging education in the US and numerous prior studies have shown the relatively poor penetration and incorporation of imaging instruction into medical school curricula across the country. These studies have suggested that more, and better integrated, imaging education is desired by US medical school leadership.

Although there is some consensus that _more_ imaging content is needed, the exact skillset that should be taught is less clear. The _type_ of content currently being taught has only been described in a limited fashion in both the radiology and education literature. Of the information available, much of it has been just recently published; the ACR/AMSER survey showed large variability across 4-year medical school curricula in terms of subjects addressed. For example, 20% of Department Chairs stated that radiation safety was not taught in their medical school at any point in the curriculum. Eleven percent stated that diagnostic imaging algorithms (or “what should be ordered when”) were not covered. A surprising number of programs taught only about radiographs (21% did not cover computed tomography, 25% taught no ultrasound, 32% did not cover fluoroscopy, and 36% taught no magnetic resonance imaging) . Some authors have suggested that teaching medical students how to _interpret_ advanced imaging modalities is unnecessary; however, students do need to understand when and why these modalities should be ordered to provide appropriate care for their patients as future practitioners , and for adequate United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) preparation in the near term.
