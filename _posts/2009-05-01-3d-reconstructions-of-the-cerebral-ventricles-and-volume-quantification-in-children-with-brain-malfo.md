## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of a semiautomated process to produce three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricles and calculate ventricular volumes from magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data in children with structural brain abnormalities.

## Materials and Methods

Fourteen children referred for MR imaging of the brain for neurologic symptoms were selected. Seven participants had structural brain abnormalities on MR imaging; seven further participants were age-matched controls with normal brain morphology. MR imaging included T1-weighted volumetric images in all cases. Semiautomated postprocessing techniques were performed on the MR imaging data to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricles. These were analyzed for morphologic changes, and volumes were calculated. Inter- and intrarater agreement of ventricular volumes were calculated.

## Results

This technique produced detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricles, even in children with grossly abnormal ventricular morphology. All MR imaging data were successfully postprocessed in <5 minutes. Inter- and intrarater reliability was excellent, with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.92, respectively.

## Conclusion

This methodology can create detailed three-dimensional visualizations and volumetric measurements of morphologically abnormal ventricles. This technique could help physicians and parents comprehend abnormal ventricular anatomy better and may have future clinical uses in monitoring disease progression or neurosurgical planning.

There are many congenital abnormalities affecting the structure of children's brains. Acquired brain injuries are also seen in childhood, including those associated with premature birth, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, or neurodegenerative disorders. Many of these conditions are associated with abnormal ventricular anatomy.

Outside the neonatal period, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has become the first-line method of investigating developmental brain abnormalities . One valuable sequence in that assessment is the T1-weighted volume acquisition of the whole brain. This can be acquired relatively quickly, with high morphologic and contrast resolution. These data can be manipulated in many different ways. Reformations can be made in orthogonal, nonorthogonal, or nonlinear planes at its simplest. At its most complex, cortical surface reconstructions and segmentation can be produced, generating gray-matter and white-matter maps for volumetric assessments of both structures .
