## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of thermally cross-linked superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle contrast (TCL-SPION) in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) for the detection of lymph node metastasis in experimental model.

## Materials and Methods

B16F1 human melanoma cells were subcutaneously injected into the thighs of C57BL/6 mice (n = 10). MRI was performed 21 days after tumor injection using a 4.7-T MR scanner. In vivo MRI was performed before and after the intravenous administration of TCL-SPION using T2 fast spin-echo and T2 gradient-echo pulse sequences. Then, ex vivo MR images were obtained for resected inguinal lymph nodes (n = 18) using the same pulse sequences as for in vivo imaging. On the basis of hematoxylin and eosin staining results, the lymph nodes were classified into three groups: group 1, nonmetastatic; group 2, tumor volume <50% of the resected sample; and group 3, tumor volume >50% of the resected sample. Size, signal-to-background ratio, and enhancement pattern were evaluated in each of the three groups on ex vivo images.

## Results

The findings observed on ex vivo MR images of 18 inguinal lymph nodes were compared with histopathologic findings. All nodes were classified into three groups: group 1, n = 6; group 2, n = 5; and group 3, n = 7. The sizes of the lymph nodes in group 1 were significantly different from the sizes of those in group 3 ( _P_ = .014), but there was no significant difference in lymph node sizes between groups 1 and 2 ( _P_ = .792). Signal-to-background ratios of samples in groups 2 and 3 were significantly higher than those of samples in group 1 ( _P_ = .045 and _P_ = .007, respectively). Each group of lymph nodes showed characteristic enhancement patterns that were well correlated between the images and pathology, except for one node.

## Conclusions

The features and extent of metastasis in the lymph nodes corresponded to those observed on TCL-SPION-enhanced MR images. TCL-SPION-enhanced MRI is useful for the detection and estimation of lymph node metastasis.

The detection of metastasis to local or distant lymph nodes is very important to predict patient outcomes and plan treatment. The survival rates of patients with malignant metastatic lymph nodes differ significantly, despite small extent of metastasis . Despite efforts to establish various criteria, thus far, only nodal size is used as a criterion for the assessment of nodal metastasis using conventional cross-sectional imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI). However, size criteria showed low sensitivity (50%–70%) in the detection of nodal metastasis, particularly in the detection of small metastasis .

MRI enhanced with superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and ultrasmall SPIO (USPIO) nanoparticles has been known to be useful for the detection of metastatic tumors in lymph nodes, particularly for the detection of occult small metastases. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are phagocytosed by reticuloendothelial cells in normal lymphoid tissues, but not in tumor tissue, because they lack reticuloendothelial cells. The nanoparticles induce a signal drop in lymphoid tissues on T2-weighted images because of their superparamagnetic effect. Therefore, metastatic tumors can be differentiated from normal lymphoid tissues using superparamagnetic nanoparticle–enhanced MRI. Various studies have shown the usefulness of SPIO and USPIO nanoparticles in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes on MRI. Recently, various types of USPIO nanoparticles have been developed for the purpose of lymph node imaging, particularly for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes . However, not all USPIO nanoparticles are suitable for nodal imaging. A long half-life of nanoparticles in blood is essential for lymph node imaging, and the size of nanoparticles is a major factor that determines their half-life in blood. Smaller nanoparticles usually have longer blood half-lives than larger nanoparticles .
