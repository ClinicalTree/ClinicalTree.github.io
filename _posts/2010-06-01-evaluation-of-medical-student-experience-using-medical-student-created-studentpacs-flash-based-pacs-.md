## Rationale and Objectives

With studies regularly containing hundreds of images, the authors believe that the ability to efficiently review numerous images and identify findings is an important skill to teach medical students. Using the StudentPACS Adobe Flash extension, created within their department, the authors created StudentPACS modules that provide users with a virtual picture archiving and communication system environment, in which findings can be selected by mouse, triggering questions with referenced answers. The aim was to assess medical students' impressions of how learning from these modules compared to their personal experiences learning radiology from textbooks or static images.

## Materials and Methods

StudentPACS modules were created by medical students on elective under the supervision of resident and attending radiologists. MS I to IV students were then asked to complete StudentPACS modules that tied in with their current coursework, followed by an anonymous survey. Approximately 293 students participated.

## Results

The majority of students reported that StudentPACS modules were either equivalent to or better than learning from static images or textbooks (90 ± 3% \[257 of 285\], _P_ < .00002), were not difficult to use (85 ± 4% \[248 of 293\], _P_ < .00002), presented them with clinical content that tied in well with the depicted imaging (90 ± 3% \[263 of 293\], _P_ < .00002), and taught them new information (69 ± 5% \[202 of 293\], _P_ < .00002). Most respondents felt the StudentPACS modules presented information they would find useful in clinical practice (91 ± 3% \[266 of 293\], _P_ < .00002), reported satisfactory experiences using StudentPACS modules as a source of self-directed learning material (79 ± 5% \[232 of 293\], _P_ < .00002), and stated that they would use StudentPACS modules for learning different topics in the future (85.6 ± 4% \[244 of 285\], _P_ < .00002).

## Conclusion

Medical students found using StudentPACS modules at least equivalent to, if not better than, using static books or annotated images.

With the growing use of cross-sectional imaging studies that regularly contain hundreds to thousands of images, we believe that the ability to efficiently review numerous images and identify important findings is an important skill that is not readily taught through the use of substantially smaller sets of static or textbook images. This lack of training can be further compounded for many medical students by limited experience directly reviewing studies using picture archiving and communication system (PACS) workstations.

To allow students the opportunity to experience searching for an abnormality on an image within a large set of images (ie, “looking for a needle in a haystack”), our department created an Adobe Flash (Adobe Systems Inc, Mountain View, CA) extension called StudentPACS that allowed us to design Flash-based radiology tutorials. These tutorials are unique in that they allow students to scroll through a series of images and, using the mouse, select abnormalities previously identified by our team . Selecting these abnormalities triggers a series of question-and-answer sets aimed to teach students some aspect of radiology pertaining to that case. As part of a radiology elective, medical students created a number of these tutorials under the supervision of resident and attending radiologists. Once each tutorial was vetted by a faculty radiologist, it was made freely available on the elective Web site (  http://studentpacs.com ).

where _P_ is the percentage with a specific response and _n_ is the total number of responses for the question. For nonbinomial variables, student responses were grouped to yield binomial variables. To test the hypothesis that the observed percentage _P_ was different (larger or smaller) than random guessing (for which _P_ = .5), _z_ scores were calculated for all binomial variables using the formula
