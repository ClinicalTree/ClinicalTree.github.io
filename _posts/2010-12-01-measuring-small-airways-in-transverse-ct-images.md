## Rationale and Objectives

Airway wall dimensions can be determined in vivo using transverse computed tomographic (CT) images, but the measurement of airway phantoms shows that the wall thickness is consistently overestimated for small airways. This phantom study was performed to derive and test corrections to the measurements on the basis of consideration of partial volume averaging and tilt effects.

## Materials and Methods

A lung phantom with six polycarbonate tubes embedded in foam was scanned, and the cross-sectional dimensions of the tubes were determined using the full width at half maximum, zero crossing, and phase congruency edge detection methods. Equations were derived using the reported wall intensity to correct for partial volume averaging. Corrections for the overestimation of the wall thickness due to the tilt of the tube with respect to the CT z-axis were also derived.

## Results

All three methods (full width at half maximum, zero crossing, and phase congruency) overestimated the wall thickness of the small polycarbonate tubes. It was verified that two sources of error were partial volume averaging and tilt that was introduced when the phantom was positioned with tube axes at an angle to the CT z-axis. The corrections were applied to the measured tube wall dimensions and substantially reduced the deviation of the CT measurements from the true values.

## Conclusions

Correcting for partial volume effects and airway tilt greatly increases the accuracy of simulated airway wall measurements in transverse CT images.

Now that the size and luminal area of proximal airways can be measured in vivo using computed tomographic (CT) images, there is increasing interest in determining the relationship between airway dimensions and clinical indices of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CT studies of patients with a range of smoking histories have demonstrated associations between the severity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and airway characteristics . Because most of the resistance to airflow occurs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the small airways , attention has turned to measuring small airways in CT images. However, technical limitations exist.

Although CT images of airways as small as 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter can be obtained and measured with reasonable accuracy , no airway segmentation method has yet emerged as a widely accepted standard. Most methods are either custom designed for the sole use of the developers or obtainable from commercial entities for licensing fees. Moreover, the commonly used full width at half maximum (FWHM) method of edge detection is known to overestimate wall thicknesses, especially for airways that are <2 mm in inner diameter (ID) .

The z-axis of the phantom is parallel to the z-axis of the CT scan, which is perpendicular to the page. The axes of tubes 1, 2, 3, and 4 are aligned with the phantom z-axis, while tubes 1t and 3t are tilted 30° with respect to the phantom z-axis. The foam also contains multiple holes, including larger openings for inserts of any materials of interest.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MeasuringSmallAirwaysinTransverseCTImages/0_1s20S1076633210004514.jpg)

![Figure 2, The computed tomographic images of tubes 1 and 4 and the graphs below the images were obtained using the public-domain program ImageJ. The graphs show the attenuation (in Hounsfield units [HU]) along the line crossing the tube plotted as a function of distance. The maximum HU value of tube 1 is much less than the airway tube attenuation, so the half maximum point is near −700 HU. This will result in a calculated wall thickness that is too large.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MeasuringSmallAirwaysinTransverseCTImages/1_1s20S1076633210004514.jpg)

In general, the denser the material, the more the beam is attenuated as it travels through the material, so μ is larger for denser materials. If the object consists of three materials, lumen, wall, and parenchyma, with the beam traveling through them one at a time, the intensity is reduced as it travels through each material.
