## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the intrasubject and intersubject reproducibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) language paradigms on language localization and lateralization.

## Materials and Methods

Fourteen healthy volunteers were enrolled prospectively and underwent language fMRI using visually triggered covert and overt sentence generation (SG) and word generation (WG) paradigms. Semiautomated analysis of all functional data was performed using Brain Voyager on an individual basis. Regions of interest for Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and their contralateral homologues were drawn. The Euclidean coordinates of the center of gravidity ( _x_ , _y_ , and _z_ ) of the respective blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) activation cluster, and the correlation of the measured hemodynamic response to the applied reference function ( _r_ ), relative BOLD signal change as BOLD signal characteristics were measured in each region of interest. Regional lateralization indexes were calculated for Broca's area, Wernicke's area, and their contralateral homologues separately. Wilcoxon's signed-rank test was applied for statistical comparisons ( _P_ values < .05 were considered significant). Ten of the 14 volunteers had three repeated measurements to test intrasession reproducibility and intersession reproducibility.

## Results

Overall activation rates for the four paradigms were 89% for covert SG, 82% for overt SG, 89% for covert WG, and 100% for overt WG. When comparing covert and overt paradigms, language localization was significantly different in 17% (Euclidean coordinates) and 19% (BOLD signal characteristics), respectively. Language lateralization was significantly different in 75%. Intrasubject and intersubject reproducibility was excellent, with 3.3% significant differences among all five parameters for language localization and 0% significant differences for language lateralization using covert paradigms.

## Conclusions

Covert language paradigms (SG and WG) provided highly robust and reproducible localization and lateralization of essential language centers for scans performed on the same and different days. Their overt counterparts achieved confirmatory localization but lower lateralization capabilities. Reference data for presurgical application are provided.

The localization and lateralization of essential brain language areas are crucial in the presurgical assessment of patients harboring brain tumors and epilepsy . Noninvasive functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides this information prior to treatment and therefore supports the selection of candidates for surgery as well as the planning and performance of function-preserving treatment . fMRI has proven validity for this application but is not standardized yet.

The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of overt paradigms in clinical standardized fMRI compared to covert paradigms in terms of language lateralization and localization. The reproducibility of clinical language fMRI for different measurements performed during the same scanning session and on different days was assessed. Robust reference data are provided for the sentence generation (SG) and word generation (WG) paradigms conducted in a covert as well as an overt manner.
