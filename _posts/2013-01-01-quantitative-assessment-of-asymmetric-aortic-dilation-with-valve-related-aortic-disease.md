## Rationale and Objectives

Previous work suggests that ascending aortic (AsAo) dilation can be asymmetric and is potentially related to valve-related blood flow abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the aortic valve and AsAo dilation using a quantitative, three-dimensional assessment of aortic shapes.

## Materials and Methods

Computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images of the thorax were retrospectively reviewed. Four groups with aortic dilation were studied: those with tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs) with and without stenosis and those with bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs) with and without stenosis. Controls had either TAVs or BAVs but no aortic stenosis or dilation. In additional to standard orthogonal diameters, a unique measurement of AsAo asymmetry was used: the ratio of the greater to lesser curvatures measured using three-dimensional reformats in a “candy-cane” orientation.

## Results

A total of 105 patients were identified. Ratios of greater to lesser curvature in patients with aortic dilation and nonstenotic TAVs were not significantly different from those in controls (1.69 vs 1.55, _P_ \> .20), but the asymmetry reflected by this ratio was markedly increased in patients with aortic dilation and stenotic TAVs (1.94, _P_ < .001). Patients with aortic dilation and BAVs had significantly elevated ratios regardless of the status of the aortic valve (1.96 for nonstenotic and 2.05 for stenotic vs 1.53 for controls, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Asymmetric AsAo dilation with relative bulging of the greater curvature is linked to aortic stenosis, but it is also seen with nonstenotic BAVs. This suggests that the hemodynamic forces that contribute to aortic dilation are not fully revealed by conventional assessment of the aortic valve.

Previous work suggests that ascending aortic (AsAo) dilation can be asymmetric and is potentially related to valve-related blood flow abnormalities. Most studies have focused on bicuspid aortic valve (BAVs), a congenital lesion seen in 1% to 2% of the general population . Dilation of the ascending aorta is a frequent complication of BAV. Because aortic dilation is often asymptomatic, it may progress unchecked to aneurysm, dissection, or rupture . Studies have suggested that using the size of the ascending aorta alone is inadequate to predict the risk for dissection, necessitating the development of better risk assessment tools .

The etiology of AsAo dilation in patients with BAVs is controversial. There is convincing evidence that it is related to intrinsic fragility of the aortic wall . Patients with BAVs have dilation out of proportion to valvular dysfunction , dilation of the main pulmonary artery in the absence of pulmonary valvular abnormality , and first-degree relatives with aortic dilation but normal aortic valves . Yet the reported asymmetric shape of the ascending aorta with BAV would be unusual if intrinsic aortic wall fragility were the sole etiology for dilation. With Marfan syndrome, the quintessential connective tissue disorder, aortic dilation is typically symmetric and most prominent at the sinuses of Valsalva. However, with BAV, unique patterns of AsAo dilation have been associated with specific aortic leaflet fusion patterns , and asymmetric bulging of the greater curvature has been reported . A potential explanation for this asymmetry is abnormal blood flow.
