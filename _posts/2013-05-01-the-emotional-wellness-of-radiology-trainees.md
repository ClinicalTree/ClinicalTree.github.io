## Rationale and Objectives

Burnout is a complex phenomenon characterized by emotional exhaustion, social detachment, and feelings of low personal achievement. In this study, we aim to establish the prevalence of burnout among radiology trainees and to explore the factors influencing its development.

## Materials and Methods

Survey data were collected from 266 trainee members of the Association of University Radiologists to assess financial status, attitudes toward money and compensation, and burnout symptomology. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyze these data.

## Results

Most radiology residents reported high levels of personal achievement but routine symptoms of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Although increasing levels of household debt were correlated with symptoms of depersonalization and lower reported quality of life, we found that the subjective financial experience was a more reliable indicator of emotional well-being. Specifically, higher subjective self-assessments of financial strain were the best predictors of symptoms of depersonalization ( _P_ < .0001), emotional exhaustion ( _P_ < .0001), and lower self-reported quality of life ( _P_ < .0001). Additionally, residents with recent moonlighting activity reported higher levels of personal achievement ( _P_ < .05), lower levels of emotional exhaustion ( _P_ < .05), and greater quality of life ( _P_ < .05) when compared to non-moonlighters.

## Conclusions

The unique nature of radiology training could mean that traditional assumptions regarding the development of trainee burnout do not necessarily apply. Finances may be an underappreciated influence on resident burnout, and subjective feelings of financial scarcity could outweigh the impact of objective indebtedness. Further study is needed to ensure that the emotional well-being of radiology trainees is optimally supported.

Burnout is a psychological syndrome, arising in response to prolonged occupational stress, which is characterized by emotional depletion, pathologic detachment, and feelings of personal inadequacy. The negative impact of work-related stress on resident physicians and their performance in the clinical setting is well established , but currently there are no studies examining the prevalence of burnout symptoms among radiology residents . Financial instability has been shown to be a principal stressor for resident physicians . However, there remains a paucity of evidence regarding the specific influence of financial strain on burnout among medical trainees . The purpose of this study is to explore the prevalence of burnout symptoms among radiologists in training and to explore the factors influencing its development.

## Methods

This investigation was exempted from full review by the University of Washington institutional review board. In January 2012, an electronic survey was distributed to all resident and fellow junior members of the Association of University Radiologists with registered e-mail addresses (1389 members). The survey questions are reproduced in the  Appendix . A 4-week reminder e-mail was sent and responses gathered for a total of 8 weeks.
