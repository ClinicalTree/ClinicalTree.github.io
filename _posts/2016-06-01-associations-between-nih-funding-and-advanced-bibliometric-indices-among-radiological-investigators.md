## Rationale and Objectives

Whereas data support the h index (reflecting both publications and citations) as an indicator of academic productivity, other advanced bibliometric indices aiming to address shortcomings of the h index remain poorly studied. Our objective was to compare the associations between bibliometric indices and total National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant funding among investigators within U.S. academic radiology departments.

## Materials and Methods

NIH grant funding amounts for 400 NIH-funded investigators within radiology departments were obtained from Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research. Investigators' publications and associated citations were identified using Scopus. Indices computed for each investigator included: publication count, citation count, h index, i-10 index, h  c index (h index adjusted for recency of publications), m quotient (h index adjusted for career duration), and e index and g index (both account for highly cited articles). Spearman correlations were performed between indices and funding. Multivariable linear regression was performed to identify significant independent predictors of funding.

## Results

For MD investigators: the indices exhibited no-to-weak correlations with funding (r = 0.173–0.387); m quotient exhibited the largest correlation and was the only significant (albeit weak) independent predictor of funding ( _P_ = 0.011). For PhD investigators: correlation with funding was weak for m quotient (r = 0.323), although moderate for other indices (r = 0.518–0.568); publication count exhibited highest correlation; publication count ( _P_ < 0.001) and h  c index ( _P_ = 0.024) were significant independent predictors of funding.

## Conclusions

Bibliometric indices were more strongly associated with grant funding for PhD than for MD radiology investigators, with publication count exhibiting the strongest association in the latter group. Time-weighted adjustments, as reflected by the m quotient and h  c index, may improve efforts to predict funding using bibliometrics.

## Introduction

An optimal approach for objectively measuring the research productivity of faculty working within an academic medical center is lacking. A straightforward and historically applied method is to simply perform a count of an individual investigator's publications. However, this scheme fails to account for wide variability in quality and impact among publications. In 2005, Hirsch described the h index , a measure impacted not only by the number of publications by an investigator, but also by the citations to these articles. According to Hirsch's original description, an investigator “has index _h_ if _h_ of his or her N _p_ papers have at least _h_ citations each and the other (N _p_ − _h_ ) papers have ≤ _h_ citations each” . Accordingly, an investigator with an h index of 10 has 10 articles with at least 10 citations, along with any number of additional articles that all have less than (or equal to) 10 citations. Since its initial description, the h index has rapidly gained interest and acceptance in academic medicine, becoming applied as a measure of academic performance . Substantial associations were identified between the h index and other measures of academic achievement in numerous biomedical disciplines . Within radiology, the h index was observed to be predictive of academic rank as well as attainment of at least one grant . Currently, the h index is used by departments for assessing faculty productivity, academic medical centers for tenure and promotions decisions, and funding agencies in grant considerations .

Despite the recent enthusiasm for the h index, the measure has also received criticism. The h index favors more senior investigators, increasing as one gains in number of publications and associated citations over the course of a career . In this regard, it fails to consider the recency of one's publications or the total time span over which they are published. In addition, all of an investigator's publications with more citations than the h index contribute equally to the index, such that the h index fails to account for highly cited publications that have an even larger number of citations . Given these limitations, other advanced bibliometrics indices have been proposed. These include the i-10 index, h  c index, m quotient, e index, and g index, which seek to complement or improve upon the h index through adjustments for the timing of publications or very highly cited articles .

Summary of Bibliometric Indices Evaluated in This Study


Index Definition Direct indices Publication count Total number of publications by investigator Citation count Total number of citations to investigator's publications Composite indices h index The number of publications by an investigator having at least h citations, whereas all remaining publications have no more than h citations i-10 index The number of publications by an investigator that have been cited at least 10 times Time-adjusted composite indices h  c  index A “contemporary” version of the h index in which each publication's citation count is multiplied by four and then divided by the number of years since publication, thereby giving greater weight to more recently published articles m quotient H index divided by the number of years since an investigator's first publication  \\*  Composite indices adjusted for highly cited articles e index Average number of citations beyond the h index for those articles included in the h index; provides a measure of measure of excess citations not considered by the h index  \\*  g index Maximal number of publications that have received an average of g citations; accounts for all citations included in both the h index and the e index
