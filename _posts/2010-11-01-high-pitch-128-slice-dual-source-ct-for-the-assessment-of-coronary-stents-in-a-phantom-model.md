## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the quality of stent lumen delineation using dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) in the standard-pitch mode (SP) as compared to the high-pitch mode (HP) in a phantom study.

## Materials and Methods

Forty different coronary stents placed in plastic tubes filled with contrast agent were imaged with a second generation DSCT system in a SP (pitch 0.23) and HP (pitch 3.4) mode in orientations of 0°, 45°, and 90° relative to the z-axis. Two observers independently measured the in-stent lumen and the attenuation values in the center of the stents. The artificial lumen narrowing (ALN) was calculated using the measured in-stent lumen and the nominal diameter of the plastic tube.

## Results

Interobserver correlation was excellent for in-stent lumen (0.86) and attenuation measurements (0.91). There was no significant difference neither for ALN (SP: 54.7–62.8%; HP: 55.8–64.0%) nor attenuation (SP: 356–395 Hounsfield units \[HU\]; HP: 352–384 HU) between SP and HP mode. For both modes, the orientation of the stent relative to the z-axis significantly affected ALN and attenuation (each _P_ < .001). CT volume dose index was significantly lower using HP mode as compared to SP mode ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

The HP mode in DSCT provides visualization of the coronary in-stent lumen comparable to that measured in SP mode while reducing applied radiation dose in a stationary phantom model.

With a total of approximately 652,000 stent procedures performed in the United States in 2006, coronary artery stenting is the predominant procedure of nonsurgical myocardial revascularization . Although the introduction of drug-eluting stents into clinical practice significantly reduced in-stent restenosis rates compared with bare metal stents , in-stent restenosis and thrombosis remain the main problems of this frequent procedure with the restenosis rate still being 8.6–21.3% 1 year after treatment . Thus, early identification of in-stent restenosis is of clinical interest to avoid recurrent ischemic episodes, prevent myocardial infarction, and thereby improve long-term prognosis. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been shown to provide high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of coronary stenosis . However, evaluation of coronary stents with MDCT has remained difficult despite ongoing advances in CT technology. Although promising clinical results for stent assessment were reported for 64-slice MDCT ( ), evaluation of coronary stents with MDCT has remained difficult. Recently, the second generation of dual-source CT systems (DSCT) was introduced, providing high detector coverage with the use of two 128-section detectors. This DSCT allows CT coronary angiography (CTCA) at high-pitch (HP) values of up to 3.4 . The HP mode in combination with large detector coverage reduces acquisition time for CTCA to 0.25 seconds. The high diagnostic accuracy of CTCA in HP mode for the detection of coronary artery stenoses is maintained .

The purpose of our study was to evaluate and compare the quality of stent lumen delineation using DSCT in the standard-pitch mode (SP) as compared to the newly introduced HP mode.
