The _Expert Radiology_ series is a new line of radiology textbooks designed to provide radiologists with more in-depth information on a variety of disease processes while providing a concise overview of their radiologic manifestations. _Imaging of the Chest_ is the text in the series devoted to pulmonary diseases, and it is apparent how much thought and organization went into its development. Broken into two volumes, the text fairly exhaustively covers the broad range of diseases of the chest and their imaging manifestations, with sections written by many leading chest radiologists from around the world. Despite the large amount of information covered, Müller and Silva have created a very readable text, broken down into 19 sections on the basis of broad disease categories and subdivided into chapters on the basis of specific diseases or processes. Each chapter covers not just the imaging characteristics of a particular disease but also its epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment options. Each chapter thus gives a reasonably complete but succinct view of a specific pathologic process, making this a worthwhile read not just for radiologists but also for pulmonologists, internists, and family practitioners who care for patients with respiratory diseases.

Although this is by no means an introductory text, and it would likely suit the needs of experienced radiologists or pulmonary medicine physicians, it is clear that Müller and Silva have also targeted radiologists and pulmonologists in training, with a highly readable style and numerous summary boxes that highlight relevant differential diagnoses, classic radiologic signs, and recommended imaging algorithms. One feature I particularly appreciated was the “key points” box that is included with the discussion of each topic, which offers a bulleted list of the most important points of that particular subject. Another high point of the text is the extensive, excellent catalog of digital-quality illustrations (more than 3100 in all, with more than 650 in full color), with selected images taken from conventional radiography, as well as multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Numerous histologic illustrations are also included, providing valuable radiologic-pathologic correlation. Given that a lack of adequate illustrations is a limitation of many textbooks, it is refreshing to find one with such an impressive selection as this.

One of the few drawbacks of this excellent text is the multiplicity of authors, which can lead to an inconsistent style among some of the chapters, but this is a minimal limitation and will be easily overlooked by the majority of readers. Another minor limitation is the lack of discussion of cardiac conditions, but a separate text in the series is devoted to cardiovascular topics. Finally, it should be noted that _Imaging of the Chest_ covers only diseases of adults, so its utility for pediatric radiologists will be minimal.

In summary, Müller and Silva have created a highly readable, well-organized text that would be a worthwhile addition to the libraries of radiologists and nonradiologists alike. Although suitable for experienced readers, it has been designed with trainees in mind as well. _Imaging of the Chest_ is a valuable asset in the new _Expert Radiology_ series, and hopefully, the other titles in the series will prove to be just as excellent.
