The field of medical education research is growing rapidly, but educational research has been widely criticized for its lack of a scientific approach, poor theoretical frameworks or study designs, deficient research methods and reporting quality, and lack of meaningful outcomes that would inform practice. There have been recent calls for greater accountability and return on investment for all research efforts and clinical practice. The impact of medical education on important health outcomes such as patient care is unclear but likely underestimated. A better understanding of the role and the structure of medical education research is called for, and in this review, the author outlines a framework for reading, reviewing, and (hopefully) pursuing and carrying out medical education research. Medical education research methodologies are discussed, along with guidelines for reading articles. A structured guideline is suggested and provided for interested readers and reviewers of educational research. Although there are challenges to be faced, they provide endless possibilities to expand and improve on medical education research and to bring it to its full fruition, alongside traditional clinical research. Education is critical to important outcomes, and a greater emphasis should be placed on understanding medical education research.

Medical education research is growing rapidly, as can be seen from a search of the literature or a review of the list of medical journals dedicated to education. However, (medical) educational research is widely criticized for not informing practice, for a lack of scientific approach, for poor theoretical frameworks or study designs, for deficient research methods and reporting quality, and for a lack of meaningful outcomes . There have been calls for greater accountability and return on investment for medical education (research) efforts .

The main goal of medical education is to produce physicians who will deliver high-quality health care . A recent commonwealth report stated that the quality of patient care is determined to some extent by the quality of medical education that students and residents receive . The connection between medical education and clinical outcomes is less clear than for mainstream scientific medical literature . More high-quality medical education research is needed to demonstrate the impact of medical education on physician quality of care and patient clinical outcomes. This evidence will be necessary to justify increased funding and resource allocation toward medical education research studies, given the current health care cost constraints.

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the Bureau of Health Professions of the Health Resources and Services Administration convened a meeting of experts to discuss medical education outcomes research in 2002. Medical education researchers, outcomes researchers, and stakeholder organizations met to determine the measurement of clinical outcomes of medical education, including physician training, the quality of patient care, and the impact of medical educational research on patient-centered clinical outcomes . An outcomes-type research framework was proposed for medical education, linking it at several organizational levels (society, health care systems, individual practitioners, teachers and educators, residents, medical students, and patients) to outcomes (including satisfaction, performance, knowledge, professionalism, quality of life, and cost) . The Medical School Outcomes Project of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the Outcome Project of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education both reflect an acknowledgment of the need to examine medical training and ensure the quality of the graduates of medical education programs . The 2001 Institute of Medicine report _Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century_ highlighted the need for medical education and workforce training to be reoriented to address health care quality and to develop strategies for restructuring clinical education to fit current health care needs. One recommendation was focused on studying the link between quality outcomes and training, given that the foundation for quality health care rests on developing good communication skills, interdisciplinary collaboration, evidence-based practice, knowledge management tools, and shared decision making across the full range of care settings .

Necessary elements for educational research include theoretical frameworks, rigorous study designs, and meaningful outcomes . However, medical education research faces many challenges unique to it that can affect the performance and quality of reporting of studies. These include insufficient resources and funding sources as well as limited research training and experience among educators, small sample sizes, outcomes that are difficult to define and measure, and difficulty navigating the institutional review board process, to name but a few . The latency of the educational effects along with difficulty standardizing educational interventions, as well as individual variability, make it difficult to measure outcomes .

Peer review lies at the core of academic literature and is the main mechanism that journals use to ensure quality . Guidelines exist in the literature for reporting randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective or cohort studies, studies of diagnostic accuracy, and meta-analyses, but to the best of my knowledge, none are specifically designed for reporting medical education research . A few authors have performed systematic reviews of the effects of educational methodologies, but no guidelines have been developed to help improve the scientific and ethical validity of educational research .

Medical Education Research Designs Compared to Clinical Research Study Designs


Clinical Studies Education Studies Example Randomized controlled trial Randomized controlled trial Randomizing half of a class of students to extra teaching, such as case-based review of imaging studies, while the other half has the usual didactic teaching only Experimental/observational/prospective cohort study Pretest-posttest control group Dividing a class of residents into two halves and aiming to keep possible confounder variables equal between the groups; testing both groups before and after half of them receive an educational intervention such as simulator training and use Posttest-only control group Dividing a class of students into two halves and aiming to keep possible confounder variables equal between the groups; testing both groups after half of them receive an educational intervention such as web-based interactive modules Observational/prospective cohort study Nonequivalent control group design Taking two groups of residents from the same program, one group of whom will have extra teaching, but they cannot be matched for possible confounding variables; testing both groups after the educational intervention Separate-sample pretest posttest design Taking two groups of medical students from different classes or schools, one group of whom will have extra teaching, but they cannot be matched for possible confounding variables; testing both groups before and after the educational intervention Pre-experimental studies Time-series designs Taking a group of residents and testing their knowledge of on-call cases repeatedly during their first year of call One-group pretest-posttest design Taking a group of medical students who signed up for a radiology elective and testing their radiology knowledge before and after they do the elective One-group posttest design Taking a group of medical students who have already done a radiology elective and testing their radiology knowledge after the elective Cross-sectional study Static group comparison design Surveying an existing group of students after some have received health information education materials No equivalent in clinical medicine Solomon four-group design Taking a group of residents and dividing them into two smaller groups, one of which undergoes the intervention and the other is the control group; within each group, half of the residents take a pretest, and all residents take the posttest Retrospective case-control study Retrospective case-control study Looking at the teaching efforts of junior faculty members who work in the radiology department and comparing teaching scores of those who trained in a university hospital with those who trained in a private practice setting Case series or report Case study Looking at an individual or a small group and gathering detailed information about a process (policies) or a phenomenon (learning about professionalism), such as from individual interviews or focus groups Descriptive study Descriptive study Describing a new method of teaching, such as problem-based learning, simulators, or interactive web modules Consensus proceedings guidelines Consensus proceedings guidelines An organization convenes a meeting of experts in the field, who draw up guidelines after discussion and publish the guidelines
