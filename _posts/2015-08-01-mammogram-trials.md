Some see in the intense scrutiny on screening mammograms a coordinated effort to discredit screening for breast cancer . However, screening generates controversy because there is so much uncertainty about the actual survival benefits of screening. There is so much uncertainty precisely because the benefits are so small at a population level .

Mammograms are one of medicine's marginal calls but mammography is no longer solely in the purview of science as it extends into domains such as anthropology, political philosophy, and psephology . Science can no longer referee the mammography debate .

The results of the 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) have added to the impasse . The study, which enrolled 89,835 women, has been cited 233 times in just over a year and has received considerable media attention . We will analyze the CNBSS for its signal, against the noise.

## Canadian National Breast Screening Study

To rationally inform policy for screening of breast cancer, the Canadian government instituted the CNBSS. This randomized control trial (RCT) divided women in two groups: age 40 to 49 years (CNBSS 1) and 50 to 59 years (CNBSS 2).
