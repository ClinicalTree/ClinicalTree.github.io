## Rationale and Objectives

Women are under-represented in radiology, but the implications of this under-representation are poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine if articles published by women in major radiology journals were more collaborative.

## Materials and Methods

Following an institutional review board exemption, we reviewed all original research articles in _Radiology_ , in the _American Journal of Roentgenology_ , and in _Academic Radiology_ from 2011 to 2015. For each article, the gender of the first and the last authors and proxy measures of collaboration were recorded, including the total number of authors, female authors, departments, and institutions. Nominal logistic regression analysis was used to test for associations while controlling for confounders.

## Results

There were 1934 articles analyzed. Female first and last authors represented 30.2% (585 of 1934) and 24.4% (473 of 1934) of the articles, respectively. A female first author was associated with more female last authors (36% vs 20%, _P_ < .001), total female authors (2.9 vs 1.2, _P_ < .001), and departments (3.3 vs 3.0, _P_ < .001). Similarly, a female last author was associated with more female first authors (44% vs 26%, _P_ = .001), total female authors (3.1 vs 1.2, _P_ < .001), departments (3.5 vs 3.0 _P_ < .001), and institutions (2.3 vs 1.9, _P_ = .006). Each additional female author increased the mean number of institutions by 0.33 and departments by 0.46 on linear regression. First- or last-author gender was not associated with total authors ( _P_ = .17).

## Conclusions

Original research articles published with a female first or last author were associated with more departments and institutions, but not with the total number of authors, suggesting that women engage in some metrics of more collaborative research.

## Introduction

Women are under-represented in radiology despite near-equal medical school graduation rates . Improving diversity is an avowed goal of the American College of Radiology, but there is little objective research on the implications of gender inequality specifically for radiology . Extrapolations can be made from the social sciences literature, which has demonstrated multiple benefits of more diverse teams and organizations. Female team members have been shown to increase a team's collective intelligence beyond the average of the individual team members or even the smartest team member . Women have been shown to improve group communications, group processes, and overall collaborations . Multiple studies have, in turn, demonstrated that compared to individual research efforts, collaborative teams produce a greater number of research publications that yield more frequent citations and higher impact . Radiology is very different from the corporate world and distinct from the other scientific fields in which the benefits of diversity have been tested, and so it is important to test whether these benefits also apply to radiology.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to determine if female radiology researchers were more collaborative than their male counterparts in research articles published in major radiology journals.
