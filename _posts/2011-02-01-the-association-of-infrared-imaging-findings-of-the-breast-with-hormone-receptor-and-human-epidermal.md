## Rationale and Objectives

Evidence on breast infrared (IR) imaging and its association with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) statuses of breast cancers is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of IR imaging findings and ER, PR, and HER2 status in breast cancers.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 163 women with 171 pathologically proven breast cancers underwent IR imaging of the breast before surgery. Five IR signs were used to score the lesions: IR1, the temperature difference (Δ _T_ ) of the lesion site from that of the contralateral mirror image site; IR2, Δ _T_ of the lesion site from that of the adjacent normal breast tissue in the same breast; IR3, abnormal vascular morphologic patterns; IR4, focal bulge or edge sign with back heat at the lesion site; and IR5, asymmetric thermographic pattern between the lesion site and the contralateral breast. The association of different IR signs with ER, PR, and HER2 status was evaluated using Fisher’s exact test.

## Results

IR1 was inversely associated with ER ( _P_ = .010) and PR status ( _P_ = .039). IR2 was inversely related to PR status ( _P_ = .020). IR5 was inversely associated with ER ( _P_ = .037) and PR ( _P_ = .022) status. No IR sign was associated with HER2 status. Triple-negative (ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative) cancers tended to show higher IR1 scores compared to other types of cancers ( _P_ = .029).

## Conclusion

Breast IR findings were associated with ER and PR status of breast cancers. Triple-negative cancers more frequently featured higher IR1 scores than other types of cancers.

Determination of the hormone receptor (HR) (estrogen receptor \[ER\] and progesterone receptor \[PR\]) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of primary breast cancers has been shown to be important in treatment planning and the prediction of clinical prognosis for breast cancer patients . Studies have been undertaken to evaluate the associations of ER, PR, and HER2 status and those of imaging modalities, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, to investigate the possible roles of diagnostic imaging findings as predictors of clinical outcomes of breast cancers . However, the association of infrared (IR) imaging of the breast with ER, PR, and HER2 status of breast cancers has rarely been studied. IR imaging of the breast, or breast thermography, is an examination that measures the surface temperature of the breast via IR radiation emitted by breast tissue . IR imaging can be used for breast cancer detection, because the surface temperature at the breast cancer site is higher than that of other breast tissue because of the increased blood flow of the malignancy . The diagnostic accuracy of IR imaging to detect breast malignancies varies among different series, with reported sensitivity ranging from 75% to 97% and specificity from 12% to 81%, according to the study design and target population . The prognostic implications of IR imaging for breast cancer remain controversial, although it has been reported that an abnormal IR finding indicates a worse prognosis, possibly because of increased metabolic rate, faster tumor growth, and tumor hypervascularity . Head et al reported that no definite association of IR findings with ER and PR status was found. However, the authors did not include HER2 status in their analysis. Our study was conducted to explore the association of IR manifestations of the breast with the ER, PR, and HER2 status of breast cancers.

## Materials and methods

## Patients

From March 2005 to June 2007, a total of 171 pathologically proven breast cancers in 163 patients (age range, 27–81 years; mean age, 54.2 ± 10.9 years) with immunohistochemical results available were included in this study. The patients were enrolled for suspicious findings on mammography or breast ultrasound and underwent IR imaging of the breast 1 day before surgery. Patients who received fine needle aspiration of the breast within 2 days or core biopsy within 2 weeks or who had undergone partial or total mastectomy were excluded from this study. The study participants were from a subgroup of patients in our previous study, which investigated the diagnostic performance of IR imaging of the breast (298 lesions from 276 women) . This study was approved by the institutional review board of the research ethics committee of our hospital, and all participants provided written informed consent before the IR examination of the breast.
