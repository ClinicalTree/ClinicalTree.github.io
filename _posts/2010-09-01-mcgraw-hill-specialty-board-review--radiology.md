_McGraw-Hill Specialty Board Review: Radiology_ by Dr Cheri L. Canon is a comprehensive, all-in-one review book geared toward preparation for the current diagnostic radiology written and oral board examinations. It is an overall great in-depth review for both residents in training and practicing radiologists. The text contains questions, answers, detailed explanations, and targeted coverage that emphasizes key material in a simple and straightforward manner while reinforcing important concepts.

The review includes more than 1000 questions with detailed explanations for correct and incorrect answers covering central nervous system, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, ultrasound, musculoskeletal, breast, interventional, nuclear, and pediatric radiology. Also included is an overview of imaging-based physics for ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine.

Content in this resource centers on the fundamentals of anatomy and pathophysiology, with concise relevant imaging correlation. It is important to note that this is not a text emphasizing image interpretation. There are essentially no radiographic images in this text, as this was not the author's goal in creating a knowledge-based text, and countless other references emphasize image interpretation quite well. This text can be used more as a reference to an image atlas or images of various diseases seen on rotation or online. To test the reader's true knowledge of the subject material, at the end of each chapter is a set of questions written in multiple-choice format with a single best answer. This way of testing mimics the current written radiology board exam extremely well and will definitely help prepare motivated residents for the exam and for practice in general. Having taken the written board exam this past year, I can attest that the questions contained in this text are very representative of the exam and the American College of Radiology's in-training examinations. The knowledge base one develops after reading this text is solid and will also likely help in preparation for the new board examination and changes being implemented in the near future.

Because this is a comprehensive specialty radiology board review, it can definitely not be read in a short period of time. It is best used as a reference text to supplement learning on rotations through each subspecialty of radiology. One can read the pertinent sections of the text during a 1-month to 2-month rotation to drive home fundamental concepts and develop a strong knowledge base during residency. There is no doubt that reading this text in full and reviewing in detail the questions and answers at the end of each subsection will help residents do well on the written boards and in day-to-day questioning from academic attending radiologists. More important, silo or piecemeal learning and forgetting will be avoided, as spending the time to read this text helps internalize knowledge, with a strong focus on anatomic and pathophysiologic understanding of disease. Using this model for education, readers truly learn the subject material and become confident with their overall knowledge bases over time.

Overall, this text provides a firm foundation for learning and reference during residency training and through lifelong learning. It definitely helps link together common concepts while presenting complex material in a simple and straightforward manner. One will acquire a balanced depth of learning with reinforcement of fundamental radiology educational concepts after reading this text.
