## Rationale and Objectives

Quantitatively analyze the computed tomography (CT) attenuation effects caused by bismuth shields, which are used to reduce superficial organ dose.

## Materials and Methods

The solid water uniformity section of the American College of Radiology CT phantom was scanned with a modified chest CT protocol. Scans were performed with a bismuth breast shield in multiple configurations, emphasizing three clinically relevant orientations. Attenuation effects were measured as changes in mean Hounsfield unit (HU) values of equal midsagittal regions of interest (ROI). Multiple statistical techniques were used in regression analysis.

## Results

Bismuth shielding resulted in significant positive shifts of the expected Hounsfield unit values. The mean nonshielded CT attenuation was −0.16 ± 0.75 HU. Based on the clinically relevant ROI distance from the shield (∼3–16 cm), the shielded values ranged from 43.8–4 HU, 45.8–10.1 HU, and 50.6–4.5 HU for shields 1, 2, and 3, respectively. All shield configurations displayed a statistically significant shift ( _P_ < .0001) at all distance ranges. The best fitting regression model was a quadratic function of distance versus logarithmic function of HU. A prediction table of the approximate shift in water HU values as a function of ROI distance from the shield was generated per shield type from their respective close-fitting regressions.

## Conclusions

The data support the claim that bismuth shields increase the attenuation of water, which can cause inaccurate characterization of simple fluid, giving the appearance of complex fluid or even solid density. However, there is potential for anticipation of the attenuation effects to validate continued use of these shields for dose reduction.

Computed tomography (CT) is responsible for a disproportionally high dose of radiation in relation to the number of studies performed annually . Patient radiation dose from exposure to diagnostic CT examinations has significantly increased in recent years because of more CT studies being performed, raising concerns as a potential cause of malignancy . CT accounts for up to two thirds of medical radiation exposure with more than a quarter billion examinations performed annually worldwide, as reported in 2004 . Because of this significant exposure, institutions have implemented a multifaceted approach to CT dose reduction . One such technique that has been shown to be effective is bismuth shielding of sensitive organs .

Studies show significant dose reduction to superficial radiosensitive organs, such as breasts and thyroid gland, when using bismuth shielding. In vivo studies demonstrate the dose reduction for the breast to range from 34% to 41% and the thyroid up to 30% . Although bismuth shielding has consistently demonstrated significant reduction in radiation dose, controversy surrounds the use of this device.

A 56 year-old female with history of left breast cancer after lumpectomy. This patient presented for multiple follow-up studies after remote left breast lumpectomy for malignant neoplasm of the breast. Two computed tomography scans of the chest performed with **(a)** and without **(b)** a bismuth shield, less than 1 year apart, demonstrate increased attenuation in the fluid-containing left breast lesion with the use of the shield (increase of about 30–43 Hounsfield units \[HU\] at 3.2–5.8 cm from the shield). In fact, when the study with the shield was initially read and only compared to the most recent one, this finding was labeled as an unchanging mass. Grossly the lesion does not change in size or shape; however, given the history of prior malignancy, having a finding that measures relatively high in density and is labeled as a “mass” adds further concern to the medical team caring for this patient as well as to the patient.
