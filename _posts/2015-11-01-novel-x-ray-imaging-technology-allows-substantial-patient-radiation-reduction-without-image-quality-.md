## Rationale and Objectives

To assess patient radiation dose reduction and the image quality of a new X-ray imaging technology during repetitive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Methods

Fifty HCC patients (36 men; 57 ± 11 years) undergoing repetitive TACE were first randomly assigned to receive a TACE treatment on a reference X-ray system or a low-dose system with advanced real-time image processing. The alternate system was used for a repeated TACE (treatment interval, 0.5–6 months). Fluoroscopy time, number of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), air kerma (AK), and dose area product (DAP) were compared between the two systems and between the two repetitive TACE. Three interventional radiologists independently rated the image quality in blinded offline readings.

## Results

Fluoroscopy time (8.7 ± 5.9 minutes vs. 8.7 ± 7.9 minutes, _P_ = .981), numbers of DSA runs (6 ± 4 vs. 6 ± 4, _P_ = .735), and exposure images (173 ± 86 vs. 168 ± 91, _P_ = .916) were equivalent between the two systems. No statistical difference in X-ray usage was found between repeated treatments. Compared to the reference system, the technology significantly reduced AK and DAP by 48.6% (0.17 ± 0.13 Gy vs. 0.41 ± 0.36 Gy, _P_ < .0001) and 50.3% (77.3 ± 55.2 Gy cm  2 vs. 195.0 ± 155.5 Gy cm  2 , _P_ < .0001), respectively. Image quality was rated comparable between the new system and the reference, with average scores of 3.9 ± 0.3 versus 4.4 ± 0.3 in fluoroscopy and 4.5 ± 0.2 versus 4.3 ± 0.3 in DSA.

## Conclusions

Patient radiation exposure can be substantially reduced by a factor of approximately two with the novel X-ray imaging technology while maintaining image quality.

## Introduction

Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can receive transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) as a palliative treatment . However, guided by fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA), the interventional radiologic procedure could result in a considerable amount of radiation which may put the patient at risk to radiation-induced skin injuries. Furthermore, because of tumor recurrence, repetitive embolization is often required , increasing the burden of cumulative radiation exposure to the patient and the clinical stuff.

In accordance with the “as low as reasonably achievable” (ALARA) principle, radiation dose should be kept at the lowest possible level when conducting radiologic procedures. However, during TACE therapies, clinically sufficient image quality might be obtained at the expense of radiation dose due to the X-ray attenuation while penetrating the abdomen during image acquisitions. Furthermore, noise and artifacts in the images, caused by breathing for instance, may necessitate additional image acquisition and increase patient irradiation.
