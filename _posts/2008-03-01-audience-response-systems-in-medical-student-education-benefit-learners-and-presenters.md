## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to assess how the use of an audience response system (ARS) in medical student radiology instruction affects the self-confidence, ability to gauge mastery, and insights for future preparation in students when they participate as audience members and when they give peer teaching presentations.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-seven medical students discussed radiology case files in groups and used an ARS to present their assigned cases to peers. Students’ views of interactive audience response versus traditional pedagogy were surveyed using a 5-point Likert scale (1, strongly agree; 2, agree; 3, neither agree nor disagree; 4, disagree; 5, strongly disagree).

## Results

Students reported that instruction with interactive ARS lectures gave them more confidence to verbally answer questions in subsequent lectures when compared to instruction with standard didactic lectures, where a presenter asks questions and a single student responds (2.35 versus 3.14, _p_ < .024). Students found it easier to gauge their level of mastery of material by answering ARS questions than by hearing classmates’ verbal responses to questions posed in lecture (1.77 versus 2.68, _p_ < .002). When giving peer teaching presentations, students reported that the ARS lecture format helped them to gauge their audience’s level of understanding (1.55, 95% CI \[1.27−1.82\], _p_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Radiology instruction utilizing an ARS can help build students’ confidence, knowledge of self-mastery, and insights for future studying. Similarly, student presenters using an ARS improve their confidence, better gauge their audience, and develop helpful insights for future teaching presentations.

Didactic lectures are a core component of medical student education. They are also commonly used for postgraduate medical education including residency training and continuing medical education ( ). However, didactic lectures demonstrate variable effectiveness as measured by short- and long-term factual recollection ( ) and modification of physician behavior ( ). Medical educators are employing various means to increase the effectiveness of the traditional lecture format. One key feature in effective medical lecturing is audience engagement ( ).

The use of an audience response system (ARS) is one method by which a lecturer can engage an audience ( ). An ARS is an electronic tool that allows the lecturer to pose questions to the audience and then provide the audience and instructor with real-time feedback. During the lecture, the audience is shown a question and an array of multiple-choice answer options. Each participant in the audience registers a response on an ARS keypad ( ). Responses are instantly tallied and displayed on a screen in real-time.
