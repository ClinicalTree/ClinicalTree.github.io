## Rationale and Objectives

The goal of this study was to determine the accuracy and precision of using scores from a receiver operating characteristic rating scale to estimate sensitivity and specificity.

## Materials and Methods

We used data collected in a previous study that measured the improvements in radiologists' ability to classify mammographic microcalcification clusters as benign or malignant with and without the use of a computer-aided diagnosis scheme. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated from the rating data from a question that directly asked the radiologists their biopsy recommendations, which was used as the “truth,” because it is the actual recall decision, thus it is their subjective truth. By thresholding the rating data, sensitivity and specificity were estimated for different threshold values.

## Results

Because of interreader and intrareader variability, estimated sensitivity and specificity values for individual readers could be as much as 100% in error when using rating data compared to using the biopsy recommendation data. When pooled together, the estimates using thresholding the rating data were in good agreement with sensitivity and specificity estimated from the recommendation data. However, the statistical power of the rating data estimates was lower.

## Conclusions

By simply asking the observer his or her explicit recommendation (eg, biopsy or no biopsy), sensitivity and specificity can be measured directly, giving a more accurate description of empirical variability and the power of the study can be maximized.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is a useful tool to evaluate imaging technology . When used in an observer study or a clinical study , ROC analysis can be used to compare two different technologies or different reading conditions. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) is often used as a summary figure of merit as it is independent of how aggressively the radiologist reads. That is, two radiologists can have the same diagnostic accuracy, as measured by AUC, but different sensitivity and specificity values for the actual binary (diseased or not diseased) medical decision. Compared to a conservative radiologist, an aggressive radiologist will have higher sensitivity, but lower specificity even if both have the same AUC. Thus, AUC is a better metric for estimating the general diagnostic accuracy of a radiologist.

While it is useful to measure an ROC curve and compute AUC, clinically, radiologists operate at a single point on the ROC curve. This operating point is important because it will define the radiologist's sensitivity and specificity. These two metrics are needed to calculate efficacy of using a technology–clinical utility and cost-effectiveness depend directly on sensitivity and specificity and not AUC . In fact, AUC cannot be used to estimate cost-effectiveness because it is averaged across both positive and negative cases while it contains no information about prevalence. Thus, it is important to determine sensitivity and specificity as accurately and precisely as possible. Further, Gur et al have argued that sensitivity and specificity maybe a more relevant clinical end points and in fact can have statistical advantages over AUC in certain situations.

The cases in italics were not recommended for biopsy, whereas the cases in bold were recommended. For each reader (R), the cases were sorted by biopsy recommendation, and then within each group, the cases were sorted in numerical order. The visual analog scale marking was converted to a value between 0 and 100.

The values are relative to actual values computed on the radiologists' biopsy recommendation as opposed to values estimated by thresholding the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) rating data. A relative value of 1.0 means that there was agreement between thresholding the rating data and the actual biopsy recommendation.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EstimatingSensitivityandSpecificityforTechnologyAssessmentBasedonObserverStudies/1_1s20S1076633213001669.jpg)
