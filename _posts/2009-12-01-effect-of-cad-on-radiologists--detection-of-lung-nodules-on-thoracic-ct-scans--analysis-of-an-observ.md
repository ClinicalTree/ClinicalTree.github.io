## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively investigate the effect of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system on radiologists' performance for detecting small pulmonary nodules in computed tomography (CT) examinations, with a panel of expert radiologists serving as the reference standard.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. Our dataset contained 52 CT examinations collected by the Lung Image Database Consortium, and 33 from our institution. All CTs were read by multiple expert thoracic radiologists to identify the reference standard for detection. Six other thoracic radiologists read the CT examinations first without and then with CAD. Performance was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristics (FROC) and the jackknife FROC analysis methods (JAFROC) for nodules above different diameter thresholds.

## Results

A total of 241 nodules, ranging in size from 3.0 to 18.6 mm (mean, 5.3 mm) were identified as the reference standard. At diameter thresholds of 3, 4, 5, and 6 mm, the CAD system had a sensitivity of 54%, 64%, 68%, and 76%, respectively, with an average of 5.6 false positives (FPs) per scan. Without CAD, the average figures of merit (FOMs) for the six radiologists, obtained from JAFROC analysis, were 0.661, 0.729, 0.793, and 0.838 for the same nodule diameter thresholds, respectively. With CAD, the corresponding average FOMs improved to 0.705, 0.763, 0.810, and 0.862, respectively. The improvement achieved statistical significance for nodules at the 3 and 4 mm thresholds ( _P_ = .002 and .020, respectively), and did not achieve significance at 5 and 6 mm ( _P_ = .18 and .13, respectively). At a nodule diameter threshold of 3 mm, the radiologists' average sensitivity and FP rate were 0.56 and 0.67, respectively, without CAD, and 0.67 and 0.78 with CAD.

## Conclusion

CAD improves thoracic radiologists' performance for detecting pulmonary nodules smaller than 5 mm on CT examinations, which are often overlooked by visual inspection alone.

Although there is controversy over whether screening with computed tomography (CT) may reduce lung cancer mortality , there is little doubt that thin-slice multidetector row CT allows the detection of more lung nodules, often of smaller size, than both thicker section CT examinations and chest radiographic images . Multidetector row CT examinations of the thorax are now commonly reconstructed at 1–3 mm slice thickness and often with overlapping intervals , resulting in a large number of images to be interpreted. Fatigue caused by the increased workload of reviewing more images per examination, combined with pressures to be time-efficient, may result in false negatives (ie, missed lung nodules). Computer-aided detection (CAD) may help reduce false negatives at a lower cost than double reading by a second radiologist.

With increased interest in the detection and evaluation of lung nodules on CT examinations, a number of research groups have been investigating the development of CAD systems for pulmonary nodules , and the effect of CAD on radiologists' performance . Several CAD systems have been approved to be used as a “second reader” for applications in mammography and lung imaging . In a second reader paradigm, the radiologist first interprets the image without CAD, and then reinterprets it after the CAD prompts are shown . If the radiologist does not discard his or her previous findings in the reinterpretation, the nodule detection sensitivity and the number of false positives (FPs) when reading with CAD will not be lower than that when reading without CAD. It is important to measure the potential increase in FPs with CAD that may adversely impact the clinical management, as well as the potential increase in sensitivity. Because many cases contain multiple nodules, it is also important to evaluate the effect of CAD on a per-nodule basis, as opposed to a per-scan-only basis. Finally, with the goal of detecting cancer at an earlier stage, it is important to analyze the effect of CAD based on nodule size. To address these issues, we designed a free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) experiment to compare the detection of lung nodules on CT examinations with and without CAD, and to analyze the dependence of the performance results on nodule size.
