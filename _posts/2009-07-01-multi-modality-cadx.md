## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system on radiologists' performance in discriminating malignant and benign masses on mammograms and three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound (US) images.

## Materials and Methods

Our dataset contained mammograms and 3D US volumes from 67 women (median age, 51; range: 27–86) with 67 biopsy-proven breast masses (32 benign and 35 malignant). A CADx system was designed to automatically delineate the mass boundaries on mammograms and the US volumes, extract features, and merge the extracted features into a multi-modality malignancy score. Ten experienced readers (subspecialty academic breast imaging radiologists) first viewed the mammograms alone, and provided likelihood of malignancy (LM) ratings and Breast Imaging and Reporting System assessments. Subsequently, the reader viewed the US images with the mammograms, and provided LM and action category ratings. Finally, the CADx score was shown and the reader had the opportunity to revise the ratings. The LM ratings were analyzed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) methodology, and the action category ratings were used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis.

## Results

Without CADx, readers' average area under the ROC curve, A  z , was 0.93 (range, 0.86–0.96) for combined assessment of the mass on both the US volume and mammograms. With CADx, their average A  z increased to 0.95 (range, 0.91–0.98), which was borderline significant ( _P_ = .05). The average sensitivity of the readers increased from 98% to 99% with CADx, while the average specificity increased from 27% to 29%. The change in sensitivity with CADx did not achieve statistical significance for the individual radiologists, and the change in specificity was statistically significant for one of the radiologists.

## Conclusions

A well-trained CADx system that combines features extracted from mammograms and US images may have the potential to improve radiologists' performance in distinguishing malignant from benign breast masses and making decisions about biopsies.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death and the most prevalent noncutaneous cancer among American women . Because early detection of breast cancer may improve the chance of survival, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 4 and 5 findings are typically referred for biopsy. Although the optimal positive biopsy rate for abnormalities detected by mammography is still being debated, positive breast biopsy rates of 25%–40% have been recommended as appropriate . Studies indicate that academic and community practices perform close to the lower end of this recommendation .

Increasing the positive predictive value of biopsy would reduce the cost of health care, spare patients the anxiety and discomfort of biopsy, and avoid the possible scarring of the breast tissue, which might complicate future exams. However, this increased positive predictive value should not come at the cost of missed cancers, but rather as a result of an overall improvement in the accuracy of breast cancer detection and characterization. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) is one of the techniques that strive to improve radiologists' differentiation between malignant and benign lesions, thus improving the positive biopsy rate without missing malignancies.
