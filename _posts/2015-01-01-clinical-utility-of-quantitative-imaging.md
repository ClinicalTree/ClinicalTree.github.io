Quantitative imaging (QI) is increasingly applied in modern radiology practice, assisting in the clinical assessment of many patients and providing a source of biomarkers for a spectrum of diseases. QI is commonly used to inform patient diagnosis or prognosis, determine the choice of therapy, or monitor therapy response. Because most radiologists will likely implement some QI tools to meet the patient care needs of their referring clinicians, it is important for all radiologists to become familiar with the strengths and limitations of QI. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Quantitative Imaging Task Force has explored the clinical application of QI and summarizes its work in this review. We provide an overview of the clinical use of QI by discussing QI tools that are currently used in clinical practice, clinical applications of these tools, approaches to reporting of QI, and challenges to implementing QI. It is hoped that these insights will help radiologists recognize the tangible benefits of QI to their patients, their referring clinicians, and their own radiology practice.

Quantitative imaging (QI) is becoming an increasingly common tool in modern radiology practice, advancing from research trials to clinical reading rooms. Today, methods that quantify imaging features assist in the clinical assessment of many patients, serving as biomarkers for disease states as diverse as brain ischemia, interstitial lung disease, and colorectal cancer. Because the potential impact of QI on patient care and on clinical outcomes is so great, the Radiological Society of North America has committed considerable resources to standardizing QI, most recently with the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA). The Association of University Radiologists' leadership, QIBA participants, and many others in the radiology community view QI as important to the future of radiology. Because it is anticipated that most practicing radiologists will eventually implement some QI tools to meet the specific patient care needs of their referring clinicians, it is important for radiologists of all subspecialties and practice types to become familiar with the various strengths and limitations of QI.

What is QI? According to QIBA :

> “Quantitative imaging is the extraction of quantifiable features from medical images for the assessment of normal or the severity, degree of change, or status of a disease, injury, or chronic condition relative to normal. Quantitative imaging includes the development, standardization, and optimization of anatomical, functional, and molecular imaging acquisition protocols, data analyses, display methods, and reporting structures. These features permit the validation of accurately and precisely obtained image-derived metrics with anatomically and physiologically relevant parameters, including treatment response and outcome, and the use of such metrics in research and patient care.”

Although this definition is comprehensive, several practical aspects of QI must be highlighted: accuracy, precision, and clinical validity. When performing measurements, we must be certain that what we are measuring has a clinical correlate, a reference standard against which our measurement has been derived. In this regard, the accuracy of a measurement describes how close the measurement is to a correct answer and thus indicates whether our QI measurement fundamentally “works.” Precision is also important, particularly given the role of QI in performing serial evaluation over time. A useful QI metric should provide the same value when measured in the same way multiple times. Precision (repeatability and reproducibility) allows us to discriminate measurement error from biologic change. Finally, QI tools that demonstrate good accuracy and reliability must ultimately have clinical validity; the results must be relevant to our practice, impacting patient care and improving outcomes.

QI has the greatest impact on patient care when the results help to: 1) inform the diagnosis or prognosis of a particular disease; 2) determine the choice of a particular therapy; or 3) monitor the course of therapy. To make a diagnosis using QI, a general consensus of normal versus abnormal QI values must be established. Similarly, monitoring the response to therapy with QI requires consensus on the amount of change that is considered both statistically and clinically significant. This article will present an overview of the clinical use of QI by presenting QI tools that are currently used in clinical practice, clinical applications of these tools, approaches to reporting that add value to clinical care, and challenges to implementing QI in a clinical radiology practice.

(b) A portion of a corresponding radiology report providing findings relating to the right-sided carotid vasculature in tabular format. Based on the provided velocities, it was concluded that the degree of stenosis in the right internal carotid artery is <50%. This lack of hemodynamically significant stenosis, which could not be reliably determined based solely on subjective assessment of the appearance of the vessel, facilitates selection of nonoperative management for the patient.

(b) Follow-up CT and fused PET/CT images obtained after 3 months of treatment with paclitaxel shows similar size of the lesion, although there has been substantial interval decrease in metabolic activity (SUV max 3.7). This interval decrease in SUV is consistent with response to therapy, which is not readily apparent based on evaluation of lesion size alone.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ClinicalUtilityofQuantitativeImaging/4_1s20S1076633214003353.jpg)
