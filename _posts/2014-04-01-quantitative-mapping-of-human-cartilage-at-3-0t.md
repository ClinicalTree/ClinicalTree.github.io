## Rationale and Objectives

The objectives of this study were to measure the parallel changes of transverse relaxation times (T  2 ), spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T  1ρ ), and the delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC)-T  1 mapping of human knee cartilage in detecting cartilage degeneration at 3.0T.

## Materials and Methods

Healthy volunteers ( _n_ = 10, mean age 35.6 years) and patients ( _n_ = 10, mean age 65 years) with early knee osteoarthritis (OA) were scanned at 3.0T MR using an 8-channel phased array knee coil (transmit–receive). Quantitative assessment of T  2 , T  1ρ , and dGEMRIC-T  1 values (global and regional) were correlated between asymptomatic subjects and patients with OA.

## Results

The average T  2 (39 ± 2 milliseconds \[mean ± standard deviation\] vs. 47 ± 6 milliseconds, _P_ < .0007) and T  1ρ (48 ± 3 vs. 62 ± 8 milliseconds, _P_ < .0002) values were all markedly increased in all patients with OA when compared to healthy volunteers. The average dGEMRIC-T  1 (1244 ± 134 vs. 643 ± 227 milliseconds, _P_ < .000002) value was sharply decreased after intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast agent in all patients with OA.

## Conclusions

The research results showed that all the T  2 , T  1ρ , and dGEMRIC-T  1 relaxation times varied with the cartilage degeneration. The dGEMRIC-T  1 and T  1ρ relaxation times seem to be more sensitive than T  2 in detecting early cartilage degeneration. The preliminary study demonstrated that the early biochemical changes in knee osteoarthritic patients could be detected noninvasively in in vivo using T  1ρ and dGEMRIC-T  1 mapping.

The earliest biochemical changes in osteoarthritis (OA) are the modifications at the molecular level of cartilage matrix that occur without obvious morphologic changes . The loss of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen breakdown are the typical characteristics of early OA.

Several attempts have been made to quantify the changes concerning the loss of GAG in knee cartilage using various quantitative magnetic resonance methods . In recent years, three relaxation methods, based on the measurement of the delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of cartilage (dGEMRIC)-T  1 , transverse relaxation times (T  2 ), and spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T  1rho or T  1ρ ), have been reported and shown to be promising . The dGEMRIC technique has been validated in both basic scientific and clinical studies by the intravenous injection of negatively charged gadolinium-based contrast agent as a marker of proteoglycan (PG) depletion .
