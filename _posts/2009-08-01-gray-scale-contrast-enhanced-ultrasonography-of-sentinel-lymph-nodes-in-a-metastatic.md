## Rationale and Objectives

Previous studies showed it was possible to employ sonographic contrast agent for identification of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). This study is to investigate the usefulness of SonoVue (a sonographic contrast agent) and gray-scale contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for detecting the SLNs in a metastatic breast cancer model.

## Materials and Methods

CEUS was performed in 12 female rabbits with breast VX2 tumor after subcutaneous administration of SonoVue. The site, number, and pattern of enhancement of the SLNs were observed and recorded. After CEUS, 0.5 mL of blue dye was injected into the same location as SonoVue and the SLNs were detected by surgical dissection. The findings of CEUS were compared with those of blue dye.

## Results

Of the 12 tumors assessed, a total of 17 enhanced SLNs were detected by CEUS. Among them, a single SLN was detected in eight tumors, two SLNs in three tumors, and three SLNs in one tumor. All the SLNs showed partial enhancement on CEUS. Nineteen SLNs were identified by blue dye with surgical dissection. There were no false-positive CEUS findings in terms of SLN detection. The overall sensitivity of CEUS for detecting SLNs was 89.5% (17/19). Among the 17 SLNs detected by CEUS, tumor metastases were identified histopathologically in 4 SLNs, whereas proliferation of lymphatic tissue was identified in the other 13 SLNs.

## Conclusions

CEUS combined with SonoVue is useful for detecting SLNs, although it may not be helpful for detecting metastases in SLNs.

The sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first node (or nodes) in the regional lymph node drainage basin to receive afferent lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor . During the past decade, sentinel lymph node biopsy has been proved a useful method to determine the lymph node status in patients with a variety of tumors, ranging from head-and-neck melanoma, breast carcinoma, to vulvar carcinoma . In patients with early-stage breast cancer, sentinel lymph node biopsy is standard care and axillary lymph node dissection is considered unnecessary when SLNs are tumor-free . Additional non-SLN metastasis in patients with positive SLNs can be estimated using several risk factors such as primary tumor size, metastatic tumor size in SLNs, lymphatic vessel invasion, and so on. All patients with positive SLNs may be treated with further axillary lymph node dissection based on their own risk for non-SLN metastasis. Thus, it is essential to detect accurately the SLNs when performing the sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Up to now, two methods for detection of SLNs have been routinely used either independently or together. First, the use of vital blue dyes, which provide visual identification of draining lymphatic channels (LCs), as well as SLNs after dissection . Second, the use of radiopharmaceuticals, which can be detected either before surgery with a gamma camera or intraoperatively with radioactive sensor probes or Geiger counters . Although the accuracy of these established approaches is high, they have potential limitations and adverse effects. For instance, the use of blue dye to identify SLNs requires surgical dissection that, in some cases, can be extensive, and there is a danger of anaphylactic reactions . Lymphoscintigraphy requires the use of radiation; thus, there is exposure to the patient as well as the surgeon and support personnel. Additionally, when lymphoscintigraphy is used, SLNs that are outside the imaging field or behind one another may not be adequately detected, leading to an incomplete SLN detection. Because most radioactive materials make use of small particles such as human serum albumin and colloid albumin, as well as filtered sulfur colloids, these small particles may pass through the SLNs, resulting in identification of secondary lymph nodes (ie, nodes that are not SLNs) .
