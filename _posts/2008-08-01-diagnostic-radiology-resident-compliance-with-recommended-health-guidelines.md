## Rationale and Objectives

To determine diagnostic radiology resident compliance with recommended health guidelines for physical activity, body weight, diet, related health indicators, and the effects of the resident work environment on compliance.

## Materials and Methods

A request was electronically mailed to members of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology and the Association of Program Coordinators in Radiology in May 2007 and again in June 2007, asking members to forward to their radiology residents an invitation to complete an online health survey. Frequency counts and Fisher's exact test, respectively, were used to summarize results and to determine statistically significant relationships between survey variables.

## Results

A total of 811 radiology residents completed the survey, representing 18% of 4,412 diagnostic radiology residents. Five hundred forty-five (67.2%) of 811 were male and 264 (32.6%) female. Two hundred ten (25.9%) were first-year, 239 (29.5%) second-year, 201 (24.8%) third-year, and 161 (19.9%) fourth-year residents. Three hundred two (37.2%) engaged in recommended guidelines for physical activity and ≤465 (57.3%) complied with each of multiple federal dietary guidelines (excluding alcohol intake). Up to 329 (40.6%) residents did not know whether they were in compliance with various dietary guidelines. A total of 426 (52.5%) residents reported working ≥60 hours/week, which significantly correlated with less physical activity ( _P_ = .013).

## Conclusion

A substantial number of residents are out of compliance with federal guidelines for physical activity and diet and are not knowledgeable about their personal dietary intake. Long work hours are related to a lack of physical activity. Radiology programs may be able to influence resident health practices by modifying work hours and the working environment, encouraging healthy dietary intake and physical activity, and instituting campaigns to inform residents and faculty about health guidelines and available wellness programs.

Studies show that maintaining a healthy weight, participating in regular physical exercise, following recommended dietary guidelines, recognizing and limiting the effects of stress, and screening for and treating high cholesterol and blood pressure lead to longer and healthier lives. Yet studies show that among American adults, the majority do not follow recommended guidelines for physical activity and diet, worker stress is high, one in four have high blood pressure, and upwards of 20% have high levels of total cholesterol ( ). The increasing prevalence of overweight and obese adults, now higher than 60%, has reached epidemic proportions ( ). Average American adult caloric consumption has increased significantly, especially consumption of non-nutritious and unhealthy foods ( ). Routine exercise is becoming a rarity among Americans, both in children and adults. Studies show that after this lifestyle pattern is established, it is very difficult to reverse ( ). Avoiding excess weight gain during early adult years may be pivotal in preventing future adverse health effects, including cardiovascular disease, and may establish a foundation for maintaining lifelong healthy habits in adulthood and for serving as healthy role models for children.

Radiology faculty serve as role models to residents and medical students, potentially influencing the choices trainees make regarding their health. Resident work hours, program flexibility in work hours, food served at department functions, wellness programs offered by programs or the institutions in which they are housed, and subtle cues that reflect faculty values regarding personal and community health are examples of factors that potentially influence the choices made by trainees. The influence that programs have on trainee health habits has the potential to impact a trainee's satisfaction with life long beyond residency and affect the culture of the practices trainees eventually join. There are many unanswered questions regarding the adequacy of training programs in promoting good health among its trainees and faculty. The purpose of this study was to determine radiology resident compliance with recommended health guidelines for physical activity, body weight, diet and related health indicators, and the effects of the resident work environment on compliance.
