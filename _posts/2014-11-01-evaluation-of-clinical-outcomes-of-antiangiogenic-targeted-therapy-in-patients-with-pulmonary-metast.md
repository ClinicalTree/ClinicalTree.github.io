## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to assess whether changes to radiographic parameters before and after treatment with antiangiogenic drugs would improve performance in predicting tumor response with non–contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NCECT) compared to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

## Material and Methods

The exploration sample group and the validation sample group consisted of 58 and 25 patients, respectively, who had pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma and were receiving antiangiogenic drugs. All patients underwent NCECT scans at baseline and at first evaluation (after two cycles of treatment) with the same scan protocol. Tumor diameter, attenuation value, entropy, and uniformity of the exploration sample group were examined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and stepwise discriminant analysis. The threshold value derived from ROC analysis and discriminant function of the exploration sample group were also used for the validation sample group and were compared to RECIST using Kaplan–Meier survival curves.

## Results

According to the model obtained from the exploration group, Kaplan–Meier curves for patients without disease progression were significantly different for the discriminant analysis of the validation sample group ( _P_ = .04) and better than individually using RECIST ( _P_ = .08), percentage change for attenuation value ( _P_ = .49), entropy ( _P_ = .47, .89, .72, .73, and .58), and uniformity ( _P_ = .53, .72, .51, .39, and .16; without filtration, at scale values of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5, respectively).

## Conclusions

Combined with changes to imaging parameters, including size, attenuation value, and uniformity between pre- and post-treatment, discrimination analysis can help predict biologic response to antiangiogenic drugs and provide a more accurate response assessment than RECIST criteria.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common cancers within the group of urogenital neoplasms . Approximately 30% of all other patients will develop metastases at a later stage of their disease. RCC is a tumor with high vascularization, and antiangiogenic drugs, including sorafenib, sunitinib, and axitinib, have demonstrated significant efficacy against metastatic RCC (mRCC) in clinical trials . Accurate evaluation is important when assessing response to therapy. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST), which is based on evaluation of tumor size, is the most wildly used classified method . However, recent studies have shown the inadequacy of RECIST for assessing therapeutic response in patients with mRCC who have received antiangiogenic-targeted therapy . Therefore, biomarkers other than size are needed for a better assessment of therapeutic response.

The application of imaging parameters including computed tomography (CT) texture for monitoring antiangiogenic efficacy has been reported in a recent study and been shown to be capable of depicting and monitoring tumor angiogenesis in patients, for which intravenous iodinated contrast is appropriate. However, renal impairment may preclude the use of intravenous iodinated contrast material in patients with renal disease . To the best of our knowledge, the use of imaging parameters including attenuation value, entropy, and uniformity of tumor for monitoring antiangiogenic efficacy in mRCC patients using non–contrast-enhanced CT (NCECT) has not been thoroughly explored. The objective of this study was to assess whether these imaging parameters will improve assessment of tumor response with NCECT instead of RECIST.

where _i_ is the pixel value in the ROI ( _i_ = 1 to n, where _n_ is the highest pixel value) and _p__i_ is the probability of the occurrence of that pixel value. Higher entropy and lower uniformity represent increased heterogeneity . The scale was selected by tuning the filter parameters between 1.0 and 2.5, where 1.0 indicates fine texture (features 4 pixels in width), 1.5 and 2.0 indicate medium textures (features 6 and 10 pixels in width, respectively), and 2.5 indicates coarse texture (features 12 pixels in width).
