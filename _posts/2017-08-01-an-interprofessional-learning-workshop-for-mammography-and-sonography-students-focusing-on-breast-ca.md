## Rationale and Objectives

The literature surrounding interprofessional education claims that students who learn with, from, and about one another in well-designed interprofessional programs will practice together collaboratively upon graduation, given the skills to do so. The objective of this study was to examine attitudes to interprofessional practice before and after an interprofessional learning (IPL) activity.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 35 postgraduate medical imaging students attended a week-long mammography workshop. The sessions provided a range of didactic sessions related to diagnosis and management of breast cancer. An IPL session was incorporated on completion of the workshop to consolidate learning. Props and authentic resources were used to increase the fidelity of the simulation. Participants completed pre- and post-workshop questionnaires comprising an interprofessional education and collaboration scale and a quiz to gauge knowledge of specific content related to professional roles. Responses to each statement in the scale and quiz score, pre or post workshop, were compared, whereas responses to open-ended questions in post-workshop survey were thematically analyzed.

## Results

Seventeen paired surveys were received. There was a significant total improvement of 10.66% ( _P_ = .036). After simulation, there was a statistically significant improvement in participants' understanding ( _P_ < .05) that IPL offers holistic care to the patient and that teamwork is useful for reducing errors in patient care. Simulation helped participants develop more awareness of their role within the profession, improve their understanding of other professionals, and gain more realistic expectations of team members.

## Conclusion

This pilot study confirmed learning within an IPL simulation improved attitudes toward shared learning, teamwork, and communication. Simulation provides opportunities for learning in a safe environment, and technology can be used in diverse ways to provide authentic learning.

## Introduction

In 2012, breast cancer was the most common cancer in women globally, accounting for 25.0% of all cancers (1.67 million new cases) . The journey of the breast cancer patient to diagnosis and management involves consultation and interaction with a range of health professionals. This group includes, but is not limited to, radiographers, sonographers, general practitioners, breast surgeons, breast care nurses, physiotherapists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and radiation therapists who all perform significant tasks in relation to the patient.

A Cochrane review of interprofessional education reported a range of positive outcomes, which included improved working culture, increased patient satisfaction, and decreased error; improved management of the care delivered; and improved knowledge and skills of professionals providing care. The literature surrounding interprofessional education claims that students who learn with, from, and about one another in well-designed interprofessional programs will practice together collaboratively upon graduation, given the skills to do so . Traditionally, health professional training exists in educational silos, resulting in a separate professional culture and inadequate preparation for working in a multidisciplinary team (MDT) . One strategy to address this difficulty is to adopt interprofessional education employing simulation, where the aims are to imitate real patients, clinical tasks, or the real-life situations in which teams care holistically for the patient . Such simulation across disciplines allows health professional students to connect, learn, and respect communication approaches and practice hands-on tasks in real time . Before the interventional study presented in this paper, students participating in a mammography workshop at the University of South Australia attended didactic sessions delivered by health professionals and specialists involved in breast cancer diagnosis. Identifying the roles of members of the MDT involved in breast cancer diagnosis and understanding the patient pathway are included in the workshop objectives. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the impact of a simulation scenario on the attitudes and knowledge of radiographers and sonographers toward interprofessional learning (IPL) in the breast cancer care pathway.

Student Responses to Professional Attitudes Before and After an Interprofessional Simulation Scenario in Breast Cancer Care Pathway ( _N_ = 17)


Survey Statement Weighted Averages Pre Survey Post Survey Patients or clients receiving interprofessional care are more likely than others to be treated as whole persons. 4.1 4.9 Developing an interprofessional patient-client pathway is excessively time-consuming. 2.79 2.7 The interprofessional approach makes the delivery of care more efficient. 4.97 5.27 Developing a patient-client pathway with other team members avoids errors in delivering care. 4.59 5.23 Developing a patient-client care plan with other team members leads to more errors in delivering care. 1.97 1.27 Having to report observations to a team helps team members better understand the work of other health professionals. 4.66 5.27 Team meetings foster communication among team members from different professions or disciplines. 5.16 5.33 I would prefer to learn only with peers from my own profession. 1.52 1.6 Learning with students from other health and social care professions is likely to facilitate subsequent working professional relationships. 4.64 4.9 Learning with students from other health and social care professions may be more beneficial to improving my teamwork skills than learning only with my peers. 4.64 4.79 Learning with students from other health and social care professions is likely to help to overcome stereotypes that are held about the different professions. 4.67 4.97 Learning with students from other health and social care professions is not likely to improve the service for patients or clients. 1.81 1.17 I have an understanding of my own approach to care within an interprofessional team. 4.63 5.13 I have an awareness of roles of other professionals on a breast imaging team. 4.63 5.3 I feel comfortable in being accountable for the responsibilities I have taken on. 4.85 5.27 I have realistic expectations of other professionals on a breast imaging team. 4.63 5.1 I have an appreciation for the benefits in interprofessional team work. 5.37 5.43

Responses based on a Likert scale on which 0 = not applicable, 1 = not at all, 2 = to a very small extent, 3 = to a small extent, 4 = to a moderate extent, 5 = to a great extent, and 6 = to a very great extent.
