## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and validity of soft copy images based on flat-panel detector of digital radiography (DR-FPD soft copy images) compared to analog radiographs (ARs) in pneumoconiosis classification and diagnosis.

## Materials and Methods

DR-FPD soft copy images and ARs from 349 subjects were independently read by four-experienced readers according to the International Labor Organization 2000 guidelines. DR-FPD soft copy images were used to obtain consensus reading (CR) by all readers as the gold standard. Reliability and validity were evaluated by a κ and receiver operating characteristic analysis, respectively.

## Results

In small opacity, overall interreader agreement of DR-FPD soft copy images was significantly higher than that of ARs, but it was not significantly different in large opacity and costophrenic angle obliteration. In small opacity, agreement of DR-FPD soft copy images with CR was significantly higher than that of ARs with CR. It was also higher than that of ARs with CR in pleural plaque and thickening. Receiver operating characteristic areas were not different significantly between DR-FPD soft copy images and ARs.

## Conclusions

DR-FPD soft copy images showed accurate and reliable results in pneumoconiosis classification and diagnosis compared to ARs.

Pneumoconiosis develops as a result of exposure to dusts, and chest radiography remains the first diagnostic step for the evaluation of lung parenchymal and pleural diseases . Chest analog radiographs based on film with screen (ARs) have been used as the standard method for recognizing pneumoconiosis according to the International Labor Organization (ILO) 2000 guidelines by referring to the 22 standard analog radiographs (SARs) . This is because they have relatively lower costs, good image quality, and high spatial resolution.

Since digital technology was first introduced in the early 1980s , chest digital radiography (DR) has resulted in a significant reduction of radiation dose without loss of image quality compared with ARs , as well as improvement of diagnostic performance and work flow. Consequently, it offers an instant image display, a wide dynamic range, an exposure latitude, postprocessing, and greater imaging efficiency .
