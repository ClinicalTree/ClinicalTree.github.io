## Rationale and Objectives

Educating medical students on appropriate imaging utilization has been increasingly recognized as important for patient care. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC) is designed to support evidence-based imaging examination selection. We sought to assess whether medical students order imaging studies independently, what resources they use for guidance, and whether they use the ACR-AC in clinical practice. A secondary aim was to determine whether increasing familiarity with the ACR-AC could impact student usage.

## Materials and Methods

We surveyed third year medical students at a single institution on their imaging practices, familiarity with the ACR-AC, and preferences among available resources to guide proper examination selection. The survey was performed in person before a lecture. We also designed a brief intervention to improve familiarity with the ACR-AC and then reassessed students to determine any effect on utilization.

## Results

The response rate for the initial survey was 103 of 109 (94%) and the response rate for the second survey was 99 of 109 (91%). Our initial survey found students initiated imaging orders independently (74 of 100, 74.8%) and consulted resources to assist in examination selection (50 of 74, 67.6%). Students expressed a preference for non-ACR-AC resources, notably UptoDate via its online mobile application. Few students (8 of 71, 11.3%) were familiar with the ACR-AC. After an intervention to increase familiarity with the ACR-AC, student awareness of the ACR-AC increased to 61 of 74 (82.4%). However, usage among those familiar with the resource remained low, 13 of 61 (21.3%) versus 3 of 8 (37.5%).

## Conclusions

Use of the ACR-AC was low among third year medical students. After increasing students' familiarity with the ACR-AC, their usage in a clinical setting did not increase. The largest barrier to use may be the lack of a quick, easy to use online mobile application–based interface.

Medical imaging is a critical and growing component of modern medical diagnosis and practice. Over the past 4 decades, advances in diagnostic imaging have contributed greatly to patient care, improving our ability to detect disease, guide procedures, and deliver treatments . Most medical specialties now regularly use medical imaging, which has led to a substantial increase in the number of diagnostic imaging examinations performed in recent years . It is estimated that imaging services have grown at about twice the rate of other health care technologies over the past decade .

The increased use of medical imaging comprised examinations that are beneficial to patients' welfare and examinations that could be considered inappropriate to use . Several publications have documented that as many as 25%–50% of advanced imaging studies fail to improve patient welfare and may be unnecessary . This not only contributes to escalating health care costs in the United States but also exposes patients to unnecessary risks including radiation, contrast-related complications , and unnecessary interventions for incidentalomas .
