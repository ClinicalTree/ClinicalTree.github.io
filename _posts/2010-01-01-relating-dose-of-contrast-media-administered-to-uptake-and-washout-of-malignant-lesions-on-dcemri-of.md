## Rationale and Objectives

To quantify the relationship between dose of contrast administered and contrast kinetics of malignant breast lesions.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 108 patients with 120 malignant lesions were selected for an institutional review board–approved review. Dynamic magnetic resonance protocol: one pre- and three or five post-contrast (at a fixed volume of 20 mL of 0.5 M gadodiamide) images. Patients were stratified into groups based on dose of contrast administered, after calculation of body weight (kg): Dose Group 1, <0.122 mmol/kg; Dose Group 2, 0.123–0.155 mmol/kg; Dose Group, 3 > 0.155 mmol/kg. Analysis of kinetic curve shape was made according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon. Several quantitative parameters were calculated including initial and peak enhancement percentage (E  1 and E  peak ). Linear regression was used to model the variation of kinetic parameters with dose.

## Results

There was no difference found in the qualitative Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System descriptors of curve shape between the three dose groups. There was a trend for E  1 and E  peak to increase from Dose Group 1 to Dose Group 3 in malignant lesions overall, as well as in invasive ductal carcinoma lesions separately. Each decrement/increment of 0.05 mmol/kg in dose yielded a decrease/increase of 78% and 97% in E  1 for in situ and invasive cancers, respectively.

## Conclusion

Contrast should be administered at fixed dose to achieve comparable levels of lesion uptake in women of different weights. Our results suggest that reducing the contrast administered to 0.05 mmol/kg, as has been suggested for patients at risk of developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, could substantially decrease the observed initial enhancement in some cancers.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCEMRI) of the breast allows for excellent visualization of lesion morphology and cancerous disease extent . Because of its high sensitivity for malignant disease, DCEMRI is being used increasingly for staging of the newly diagnosed breast cancer patient, for high-risk screening, and for follow-up of patients undergoing therapeutic interventions . Lesions are visualized after intravenous injection of contrast media, usually a gadolinium chelate, which accumulates in and around malignant tumors because of their dense and leaky neovasculature. Analysis of the time course of contrast media uptake and washout (ie, the kinetic curve) is important for lesion evaluation, because malignant tumors tend to exhibit a “washout” curve shape, whereas benign lesions often show “persistent” contrast uptake over time .

The injection of contrast media is a crucial component of breast DCEMRI acquisitions, because it is required for both lesion visualization and characterization. Yet, despite years of breast magnetic resonance imaging and clinical investigations, contrast media is typically used “off-label” for breast DCEMRI. Ideally, it should be expected that sufficient quantity of contrast is injected for reliable detection of all malignancies; an excessive quantity should be avoided to prevent toxicity, such as development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with compromised kidney function ; and it is administered in such a way to minimize interpatient variability, ensuring that similar interpretation criteria can be consistently applied in the evaluation and characterization of lesions. The American College of Radiology (ACR) practice guidelines recommend that contrast be administered at a fixed dose of 0.1 mmol/kg via a bolus injection, followed by at least a 10-mL saline flush . By injecting a fixed dose, heavier women receive a larger volume (in milliliters) of contrast media compared to normal weight women. This is to be distinguished from injecting a fixed volume of contrast, so that regardless of weight, all women will receive the same volume of contrast media. This method was used more commonly in the past, and continues to be employed in some institutions.

Higher SER has been correlated with increased vascularity and malignancy in other reports . Finally, the time to peak enhancement (T  peak ) was calculated in seconds .
