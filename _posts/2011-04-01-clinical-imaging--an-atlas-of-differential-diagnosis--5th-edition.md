_Clinical Imaging: An Atlas of Differential Diagnosis_ , by Ronald L. Eisenberg of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, is a superbly illustrated, comprehensive atlas of differential diagnosis in radiology. This timeless and highly detailed atlas provides an approach to pattern recognition to aid clinicians and radiologists alike in diagnosis.

The atlas sections include chest, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, skeletal, spine, skull, breast, and fetal ultrasound. This single-volume bestselling atlas is now in its fifth edition, with updated material, including positron emission tomography/computed tomography and more coverage of magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. Differential diagnoses are offered across a broad spectrum of radiographic patterns. Dr Eisenberg has appropriately updated differential diagnosis lists, and several new illustrations have been added. The wealth of images guide readers in the interpretation of abnormalities in imaging across various specialties by pointing out the subtle differences in appearance among conditions with similar imaging manifestations. Pattern recognition is again the main focus of this atlas. This is important, as it caters to general radiologists’ day-to-day needs. In addition, the comprehensive nature of this atlas makes it a key tool for radiology resident board preparation.

I find _Clinical Imaging_ useful for interested medical students, practicing radiologists, radiology residents and fellows, clinicians in all specialties, and others generally interested in high-quality pattern recognition imaging with attention to differential diagnosis. Extensive cross-referencing is provided, limiting duplication and allowing the reader to appreciate various imaging manifestations of the same condition. The images are neatly organized and not at all cluttered. This makes for easy navigation through the comprehensive text, with the added benefit of online access to the fully searchable text after purchase and online activation.

_Clinical Imaging: An Atlas of Differential Diagnosis_ is an excellent atlas, with informative detail and high-quality illustrations and imaging. In the increasingly complex daily challenge of interpreting imaging, this atlas is a powerful and handy reference tool. It is a key reference for resident board preparation and extremely useful in practice. This atlas should definitely be on the bookshelves of all radiologists.
