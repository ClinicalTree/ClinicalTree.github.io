Bringing diagnostic or therapeutic devices to a target tissue via vascular inserted catheters has been the mainstay of interventional radiology, vascular surgery, and interventional cardiology since the 1930s . Catheter technology has dramatically improved over time, a result of using novel mechanical engineering and materials science, leading to a variety of application-specific kits. There are, however, three issues that limit catheter applications and affect procedure duration, outcomes, and the number and severity of complications . The first issue is visualization of catheter position and orientation. The second is visualization of tissues that surround the catheter during various stages of the procedure. The third issue is improved catheter steering, because catheters are manipulated by hand motion occurring at large (1.2–1.6 m) distances from the catheter distal tip.

For catheter position and orientation visualization, the classic imaging modality of X-ray fluoroscopy, has many advantages, such as a high-temporal update and a strong contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between catheters and the vascular background . There are also a number of disadvantages: shadowing effects when multiple catheters are in proximity; interference from obstructing highly absorptive tissues, such as bones; the availability of projection views only, lacking depth localization; and a radiation dose to both patient and clinician. In addition, during navigation in small vessels, if the surrounding vascular bed is not well seen, repeated ionic-contrast injection is required. Finally, the interventional staff wears heavy lead aprons, which contributes to a high incidence of back pain.

The early 1990s saw the introduction of non–X-ray based techniques to track catheter position. The most widely used navigational tools are based on electromagnetic (EM) methods. These can either be magnetic or electrical . Using these systems significantly reduced the radiation dose during navigation and treatment and dramatically improved the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of catheter shape and its spatial localization.

Visualizing the tissues around the catheter remains a large problem. This dilemma was somewhat improved by using 3D rotational X-ray fluoroscopy , which created a 3D anatomic image. Yet, this did little to resolve X-ray’s weak CNR for soft tissues, and it increased the X-ray dose and required contrast injection.

Since the early 2000s, this issue is being addressed by registering images with improved soft-tissue and vascular CNR to the X-ray system , or later on to the EM tracking systems. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, acquired before the intervention, are co-registered with the intraprocedural fluoroscopy frame of reference, or, using commercially available software packages , they are co-registered with the EM tracking systems. These strategies improve the visualization of the vascular anatomy and its surrounding tissues, and further reduce x-ray dose. Using EM tracked systems with co-registered imaging, the catheters’ 3D position relative to its surrounding structures can be nicely observed. However, distortions and inaccuracies remain , mainly because of changes in the anatomy shape, occurring between the preprocedural imaging session and the intervention, which may be large (>5 mm) in spinal, abdominal, and cardiac anatomy, and also from changes in anatomy that occur in the midst of the procedure.

Improvements in catheter steering started in the mid-2000s with the introduction of robotic technology that could deflect and advance intra vascular catheters. The most common commercial systems use strong magnetic field gradients to move a ferromagnetic catheter tip , or a pull-wire manipulated sheath, which is placed around the catheter . These systems have simplified navigation and may improve the consistency of therapy delivery. In addition, with the robot-controlling consoles placed outside the X-ray suite, radiation exposure to the physician is reduced.
