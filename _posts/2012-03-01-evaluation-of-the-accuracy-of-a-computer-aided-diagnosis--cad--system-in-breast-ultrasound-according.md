## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for breast ultrasound to improve the characterization of breast lesions detected on ultrasound by junior and senior radiologists.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred sixty ultrasound breast lesions were randomly reviewed blindly by four radiologists with different levels of expertise (from 20 years \[radiologist A\] to 4 months \[radiologist D\]), with and without the help of an ultrasound CAD system (B-CAD version 2). All lesions had been biopsied. Sensitivity and specificity with and without CAD were calculated for each radiologist for the following evaluation criteria: Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category and the final diagnosis (benign or malignant). Intrinsic sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of CAD alone were also calculated.

## Results

CAD detected all cancers, and its use increased radiologists’ sensitivity scores when this was possible (with vs without CAD: radiologist A, 99% vs 99%; radiologist B, 96% vs 87%; radiologist C, 95% vs 88%; radiologist D, 91% vs 88%). Seven additional cancers were diagnosed. However, the low specificity of CAD (48%) decreased the specificity of radiologists, especially of the more experienced among them (with vs without CAD: radiologist A, 46% vs 70%; radiologist B, 58% vs 80%; radiologist C, 57% vs 69%; radiologist D, 71% vs 71%).

## Conclusions

CAD for breast ultrasound appears to be a useful tool for improving the diagnosis of malignant lesions for junior radiologists. Nevertheless, its low specificity must be taken into account to limit biopsies of benign lesions.

In clinical practice, breast ultrasound is the main complementary examination to mammography, both for detecting breast lesions and for lesion characterization. This is the method of choice for differentiating cysts from solid lesions . Stavros et al were the first to describe specific ultrasound criteria for differentiating benign and malignant features of solid lesions.

Ultrasound is a readily available, nonradiating, inexpensive, well-tolerated technique that allows interventional procedures , but the main limitation is operator dependence . Thus, less experienced radiologists are at greater risk for misdiagnosing a cancer and for increasing the number of false-positives.
