## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose, contrast-enhanced (CE), time-resolved, three-dimensional magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the assessment of the abdominal aorta and its major branches at 3 T and to compare the results with those of high–spatial resolution CE MRA.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-two consecutive patients (eight men, 14 women; mean age, 43.9 ± 17.9 years) underwent CE time-resolved three-dimensional MRA and high–spatial resolution three-dimensional MRA. Studies were performed using a 3-T magnetic resonance system; gadolinium-based contrast medium was administered at a dose of 3 to 5 mL for time-resolved MRA, followed by 0.1 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine for single-phase CE MRA. For analysis purposes, the abdominal arterial system was divided into 11 arterial segments, and image quality as well as the presence and degree of vascular pathology were evaluated by two independent magnetic resonance radiologists.

## Results

A total of 242 arterial segments were visualized with good image quality. Time-resolved MRA was able to visualize the majority of arterial segments with good definition in the diagnostic range. Vascular pathologies (stenosis, occlusion) or abnormal vascular anatomy was detected in 19 arterial segments, with good interobserver agreement (κ = 0.78). All image findings were detected with time-resolved CE MRA by both observers and were confirmed by correlative imaging.

## Conclusion

Low-dose, time-resolved MRA at 3 T yields rapid and important anatomic and functional information in the evaluation of the abdominal vasculature. Because of its limited spatial resolution, time-resolved MRA is inferior to CE MRA in demonstrating fine vascular details.

Three-dimensional (3D) contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance (MR) angiography (MRA) has made substantial technical advances in the past decade and is now widely used in many applications . Furthermore, CE MRA has been accepted in clinical routine as a substitute for the standard of reference, digital subtraction angiography (DSA), for evaluating the abdominal vasculature and its major branches .

Today most conventional CE MR angiographic methods aim to capture a single imaging volume at peak arterial contrast enhancement with minimal venous overlay. Therefore, these methods require that the acquisition and breath-hold coincide with the presence of the contrast bolus in the vessels of interest for optimal visualization of the arterial tree. But the timing of contrast material arrival may be crucial, because sufficient T1 shortening of blood is achieved only for few seconds during peak vascular concentration. As a result, delayed acquisition will lead to a substantial decrease in diagnostic accuracy. To guarantee accurate bolus timing, different strategies have been developed, including the test-bolus technique , automated detection of the contrast material , and real-time depiction of bolus arrival .
