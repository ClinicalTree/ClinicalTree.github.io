## Objectives

The objective of this study was to find clinical parameters and qualitative and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features for differentiating uterine sarcoma from atypical leiomyoma (ALM) preoperatively and to calculate predictive values for uterine sarcoma.

## Materials and Methods

Data from 60 patients with uterine sarcoma and 88 patients with ALM confirmed by surgery and pathology were collected. Clinical parameters, qualitative MRI features, diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient values, and quantitative parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of these two tumor types were compared. Predictive values for uterine sarcoma were calculated using multivariable logistic regression.

## Results

Patient clinical manifestations, tumor locations, margins, T2-weighted imaging signals, mean apparent diffusion coefficient values, minimum apparent diffusion coefficient values, and time-signal intensity curves of solid tumor components were obvious significant parameters for distinguishing between uterine sarcoma and ALM (all _P_ < .001). Abnormal vaginal bleeding, tumors located mainly in the uterine cavity, ill-defined tumor margins, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient values of <1.272 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s were significant preoperative predictors of uterine sarcoma. When the overall scores of these four predictors were greater than or equal to 7 points, the sensitivity, the specificity, the accuracy, and the positive and negative predictive values were 88.9%, 99.9%, 95.7%, 97.0%, and 95.1%, respectively.

## Conclusions

The use of clinical parameters and multiparametric MRI as predictive factors was beneficial for diagnosing uterine sarcoma preoperatively. These findings could be helpful for guiding treatment decisions.

## Introduction

Uterine sarcoma is a rare tumor characterized by high malignancy and very poor prognosis . The most common entities are leiomyosarcoma (LMS), endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS), and carcinosarcoma . However, according to the Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system revised in 2009, carcinosarcoma is regarded as a subset of endometrial carcinoma because of the similarity in biological behavior . The standard surgical excision of uterine sarcoma consists of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy . Uterine leiomyoma (LM) is the most common benign smooth muscle tumor of the uterus and can be treated with nonsurgical options, such as drugs , high-intensity focused ultrasound , and artery embolization . Uterine sarcoma is often misdiagnosed as LM because of their similar clinical presentations ; thus, it is very important to distinguish them to avoid delaying hysterectomy in women with presumed symptomatic fibroids who, in fact, have a uterine sarcoma.

Previous studies have reported that uterine sarcoma differed from benign uterine tumors in patient age, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and endometrial cytology findings , whereas there are many overlaps between uterine sarcoma and LM in age and LDH levels, and endometrial cytology is negative when the tumor is located in the myometrium only. Therefore, it is difficult to differentiate uterine sarcoma from LM by relying only on clinical parameters. Imaging examinations are necessary to identify them precisely.
