## Rationale and Objectives

We evaluated the accuracy and reproducibility of three-dimensional (3D) measurements of lung phantoms and patient tumors from x-ray computed tomography (CT) and compared these to one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) measurements.

## Materials and Methods

CT images of three spherical and three irregularly shaped tumor phantoms were evaluated by three observers who performed five repeated measurements. Additionally, three observers manually segmented 29 patient lung tumors five times each. Follow-up imaging was performed for 23 tumors and response criteria were compared. For a single subject, imaging was performed on nine occasions over 2 years to evaluate multidimensional tumor response. To evaluate measurement accuracy, we compared imaging measurements to ground truth using analysis of variance. For estimates of precision, intraobserver and interobserver coefficients of variation and intraclass correlations (ICC) were used. Linear regression and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate agreement and tumor response was descriptively compared.

## Results

For spherical shaped phantoms, all measurements were highly accurate, but for irregularly shaped phantoms, only 3D measurements were in high agreement with ground truth measurements. All phantom and patient measurements showed high intra- and interobserver reproducibility (ICC >0.900). Over a 2-year period for a single patient, there was disagreement between tumor response classifications based on 3D measurements and those generated using 1D and 2D measurements.

## Conclusion

Tumor volume measurements were highly reproducible and accurate for irregular, spherical phantoms and patient tumors with nonuniform dimensions. Response classifications obtained from multidimensional measurements suggest that 3D measurements provide higher sensitivity to tumor response.

Quantitative radiological evaluation of tumor response to therapy using one-dimensional (1D) measurements is still the mainstay of clinical practice, but it is well-understood that in some cases, the responses derived from 1D measurements may not adequately reflect the clinical situation . The two-dimensional (2D) measurement pioneered by the World Health Organization (WHO) is generated as the cross-product of the longest axis of the tumor and its longest perpendicular bisector , whereas the 1D measurement or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors method (RECIST) is the length of the longest tumor axis . Both 1D and 2D measurements require the radiologist to first evaluate all image slices and typically, manual measurements are performed. These and other limitations have led to the development of three-dimensional (3D) or volumetric measurements , which in some cases may be considered more representative estimates of the clinical situation .

The effect of tumor shape on measurement accuracy is important, because lesions are seldom perfectly spherical and often have irregular or difficult-to-define margins in which a change in diameter may not accurately reflect overall changes in tumor size . Tumor measurements that incorporate multiple dimensions provide a way to evaluate irregular masses and there is consensus that with the increased dimensions, the precision of the measurements is not compromised . Moreover, it has been suggested that the sensitivity of 3D measurements to therapy response is significantly greater than 1D and 2D measurements . Unfortunately, there is not yet sufficient evidence to qualify lung tumor volume as a biomarker of solid tumor response and to incorporate this into mainstream radiology workflow. In this regard, it is important to consider tumor response over more than two or three individual time points and currently the majority of previous studies have been limited to at most three independent imaging sessions.
