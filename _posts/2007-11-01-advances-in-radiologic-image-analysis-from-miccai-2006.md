The 9th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention, MICCAI 2006, was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, at the Tivoli Concert Hall with satellite workshops and tutorials at the IT University of Copenhagen, October 1–6, 2006. The conference has become the premier international conference with in-depth full-length articles in the multidisciplinary fields of medical image computing, computer-assisted intervention, and medical robotics. The conference brings together clinicians, computer scientists, engineers, physicists, and other researchers and offers a forum for exchange of ideas in a multidisciplinary setting.

Selected papers from MICCAI 2005 ( ) were published in a previous issue of _Academic Radiology_ and were well received by the readers. MICCAI 2007 (  www.miccai2007.org ) will be held in Brisbane, Australia, October 29–November 2, 2007.

For the MICCAI 2006 conference, a careful review and selection process was executed to secure the best possible program. We received 578 scientific papers, from which 39 articles were selected for the presentation in the single track oral program and 193 articles for the poster program. The authors of 16 of these articles addressing technical as well as clinical issues were invited to submit extended versions of their articles for this special issue. These articles went through a new review process and finally eight articles ( ) were accepted for publication. Additional articles from MICCAI 2006 were selected for special issues of _Medical Image Analysis_ and _Computer-Aided Surgery._

The selected articles cover a series of topics of interest for _Academic Radiology_ readers, such as medical image computing, computer-assisted interventional systems and robotics, new applications for specific imaging systems, bioscience applications and computer-aided diagnosis, and visualization and feedback.

In the article by Wong et al ( ), a cardiac physiome model comprising an electrical wave propagation model, an electromechanical coupling model, and a biomechanical model is applied as a prior constraint for extracting cardiac deformation data from magnetic resonance image sequences of the heart. This is an extension from previous work on constraining models based on biomechanics only. The present work leads to more physiologic meaningful results.

Deformation modeling is also an important factor in the article by Murgasova et al ( ). Their work addresses the use of brain atlases for segmentation of brain structures in magnetic resonance imaging of young children. A probabilistic atlas for different brain structures is constructed by nonlinear deformation of a set of training examples and a single manually segmented example in to a common frame of reference. The probabilistic atlas is then used as a prior for subsequent voxel classification. The results show an improvement over previous work using the expectation-maximization algorithm for brain segmentation.
