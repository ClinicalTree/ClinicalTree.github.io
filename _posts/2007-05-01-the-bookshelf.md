In the preface, the authors of the _Teaching Atlas of Chest Imaging_ state, “Radiology residents need to be exposed to a large volume of thoracic imaging cases in order to master image interpretation.” This excellently illustrated compilation of 192 cases achieves that objective in an efficient and enjoyable text.

As the title suggests, the text is a collection of illustrative cases. The text begins with a comprehensive depiction of normal thoracic anatomy, which progresses through a detailed description of the appearances of normal anatomic structures on plain film, CT, and MRI. The explanation of the three-dimensional complexity of the anatomy of the major fissures is particularly good, as is the illustration of the accessory fissures. As befits a teaching atlas, the authors have used illustrations and diagnostic images to teach the relevant thoracic anatomy. The text is confined to the minimum necessary to communicate important facts.

“Section II: Developmental Anomalies” covers the major diagnoses that a resident might expect to see on American Board of Radiology examinations. Many of these conditions are uncommon in clinical adult radiology practice—but their recognition remains relevant both in the reading room and for examination study. The reviewer found the line diagrams very useful for complex lesions such as pulmonary sequestration. “Section III: Airways Disease” covers the major airway diseases in a logical progression from large to small. The reviewer was particularly favorably impressed with the quality of the plain film radiograph images used to depict bronchiectasis. In the reviewer’s experience, airway disease images are often suboptimal in texts, yet the images of cystic fibrosis in the _Teaching Atlas of Chest Imaging_ are excellent. “Section IV: Atelectasis” was the highlight of the text for this reviewer. This topic is crucially important, both for examination study and clinical work, and is comprehensively covered in 50 pages. The collapse of every lobe is clearly depicted. “Section VI: Neoplastic Disease” contains useful cases that illustrate lung carcinoma at different stages. “Section VIII” illustrates multiple cases of line malposition or dysfunction. Residents would likely find this section useful when interpreting intensive care films. The remaining sections cover pulmonary infections and aspiration, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, occupational lung disease, trauma, and mediastinal and chest wall disease. Case selection is consistently excellent, as is the description of findings throughout the text. The differential diagnoses are practical and concisely presented. Similar lesions are presented in sequence, maximizing the reader’s appreciation of subtle differences in radiological appearance.

The reviewer is an Australian gastrointestinal radiologist, who used the text to prepare for the American Board of Radiology oral examinations. The reviewer now routinely uses the text when reading thoracic imaging studies. The _Teaching Atlas of Chest Imaging_ is highly useful both for board preparation and in the radiology reading room and is recommended to radiology residents and fellows, generalists in radiology practice, and physicians in related specialties.
