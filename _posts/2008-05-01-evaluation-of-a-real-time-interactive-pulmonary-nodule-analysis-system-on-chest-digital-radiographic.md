## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to assess the performance of a real-time interactive pulmonary nodule analysis system for evaluation of chest digital radiographic (DR) images in a routine clinical environment.

## Materials and Methods

A real-time interactive pulmonary nodule analysis system for chest DR image softcopy reading (IQQA-Chest; EDDA Technology, Princeton Junction, NJ) was used in daily practice with a Picture Archiving and Communication System in a National Cancer Institute−designated cancer teaching hospital. Patients referred for follow-up of known cancer underwent digital chest radiography. Posteroanterior and lateral DR images were first read by resident radiologists along with experienced chest radiologists using a Picture Archiving and Communication System work station. The computer-assisted detection (CAD) program was subsequently applied to the posteroanterior DR images, and changes (if any) in diagnosis were recorded. For reference standard, a follow-up chest radiograph at least 6 months following the initial examination or a follow-up computed tomographic scan of the chest within 3 months was used to establish diagnostic accuracy.

## Results

Of 324 DR examinations, follow-up imaging according to our parameters was available for 214 patients (67%). Lung nodules were found and subsequently confirmed in 35 patients (10%) without CAD. Using CAD, nodules were found and subsequently confirmed in 51 patients (15%), improving sensitivity from 63.8% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.49%−0.76%) to 92.7% (95% CI, 0.82%−0.98%) ( _P_ < .0001, McNemar). Nodules were subsequently proved to be malignant in five of the 16 additional cases (31%). False-positive readings increased from three to six cases; specificity decreased from 98.1% (95% CI, 0.95%−0.99%) to 96.2% (95% CI, 0.92%−0.98%) (not significant). There were 153 true-negative cases (71.4%).

## Conclusions

This study suggests that the interpretation of chest radiographs for lung nodules can be improved using an automated CAD nodule detection system. This improvement in reader performance comes with a minimal number of false-positive interpretations.

Chest radiography remains a popular modality for the surveillance of pulmonary metastatic disease in patients with known malignancies. It is vitally important to detect pulmonary nodules as early as possible in this patient population in an effort to initiate timely treatment. It is well known, however, that chest radiography is not very sensitive for demonstrating small nodules, especially those less than 1 cm in diameter ( ). Furthermore, perception studies repeatedly have shown that the detection rate of pulmonary nodules on chest films is poor, with radiologist performances ranging from 50% to 70% ( ). It has been argued that computed tomography (CT) is not suitable for the screening of lung cancer ( ), and likewise, the greater expense and substantially greater radiation exposures preclude CT from serving as a surveillance examination for metastatic disease in the vast majority of patients.(

Computer-assisted detection (CAD) software has been developed for a range of applications, including mammography, and chest CT ( ). In an effort to obviate low nodule detection rates inherent with chest radiography, the application of CAD to film interpretation may result in a significant improvement in overall reader performance ( ). Several studies have already shown that incorporating CAD into routine chest film interpretation has improved reader performance significantly ( ). Two previous studies reported that lung nodule detection rates improved when applied to both lung cancer screening ( ) and cancer follow-up radiographs ( ). The aim of this project was to investigate the benefit of CAD for nodule detection on chest films obtained in daily practice on patients under surveillance for metastatic disease.(
