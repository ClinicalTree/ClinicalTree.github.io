Please note the following corrections to the above-referenced paper:

- 1)
In Equation 1, page 1519: replace Rij
R

i

j
    by Rjt
R

t


- 2)
In the paragraph that precedes the “Creating the Unequal-Variance RM Model” section on page 1519: replace Rij
R

i

j
    by Rjt
R

j

t
    in the sentence beginning “For the effects …”

- 3)
Incorrect subscripts are used with τ in the paragraph on page 1519 beginning with “For test _i_ and fixed reader _j_ …” in the “Creating the Unequal-Variance RM Model” section. The correct expression is given by


μ−+τi−+Rj−+(τR)ij−andμ++τi++Rj++(τR)ij+
μ
