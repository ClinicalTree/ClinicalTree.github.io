## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze the dominant factors affecting fatigue caused by soft-copy reading to identify a method for decreasing fatigue in clinical practice.

## Materials and Methods

Two types of fatigue—fatigue in the central nervous system and subjective visual fatigue—were evaluated using a critical fusion frequency test and a questionnaire administered to 17 male radiologists before and after soft-copy reading. Reading-induced fatigue was assumed to be affected by 20 hypothetical factors associated with personal characteristics, time required for reading, content or amount of reading, and the reading environment. We used multiple linear regression analysis with a variable selection method to detect the best combination of factors capable of expressing variations in each of the measured fatigue values. The effects of the detected (dominant) factors on fatigue were also examined based on coefficients of the dominant factors in multiple regression models.

## Results

Fatigue in the central nervous system decreased with a higher corrected visual acuity and a higher ambient illuminance in the reading room and was also affected by the type of monitor used. Visual fatigue was relieved when there was a larger difference in the brightness of the monitor and the surfaces surrounding the monitor and tended to be more severe when glasses rather than contact lenses were worn.

## Conclusions

Increasing the ambient illuminance, using an appropriate type of monitor, improving the corrected visual acuity, and using contact lenses rather than eyeglasses could help decrease reading-induced fatigue in male radiologists.

The number of images produced in radiology departments has increased rapidly because of recent progress in the development of various imaging modalities, including a variety of magnetic resonance imaging sequences and multi–detector-row computed tomography (CT). Radiologists now have to read more images in less time ; as a result, most radiologists have reported severe reading-induced visual fatigue . Values representing visual fatigue and other types of fatigue in the central nervous system (CNS) have been reported to be significantly changed by the reading of digital images displayed on an electronic display device (soft-copy reading) . Visual fatigue arises from a near-viewing task or from tasks associated with large differences in brightness between the observed object and the surfaces surrounding the object ; CNS fatigue arises from mental work . Furthermore, according to Krupinski et al , a decline in diagnostic accuracy could be caused by a day of soft-copy reading. These reports imply that a reading environment with less fatigue will not only yield improved efficiency in clinical reading but also higher-quality medical care for patients. To create a reading environment with less fatigue, it is important to investigate the factors that affect fatigue. Previous studies have reported several factors that could affect reading-induced fatigue, such as experience image reading , the amount of sleep the previous night , age, sex, reading time, and frequency of breaks . However, no report has provided a quantitative comparison of the effects of various factors on reading-induced fatigue.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the dominant factors affecting fatigue caused by routine soft-copy reading by radiologists in order to identify effective countermeasures.

The _CFF_ RR value will show a positive correlation with reading-induced fatigue in the CNS. In other words, when more fatigue in the CNS is caused by soft-copy reading, the _CFF_ RR will be higher than 0%. In contrast, a value less than 0% indicates relief from fatigue.

The _SSQ_ D value will show a positive correlation with visual fatigue caused by reading. In other words, when soft-copy reading causes more visual fatigue, the _SSQ_ D will be higher than 0. A value less than 0 indicates relief from fatigue.
