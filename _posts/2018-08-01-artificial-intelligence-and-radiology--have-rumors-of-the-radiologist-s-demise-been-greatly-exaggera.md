Artificial intelligence is a rapidly evolving computerized technology affecting multiple aspects of our lives. It is predicted that artificial intelligence will lead to a fundamental change in practice of many professional fields, including medicine. One of the most significant advances in artificial intelligence involves digital imaging and image recognition. Consequently, radiologists, who work in the most digitalized field of medicine, need to be familiar with this rapidly progressing technology. “Artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” and “deep learning” are terms that tend to be used interchangeably in terms of advanced computer algorithms, but each has a different meaning. Objectives for this article are to demystify these terms for radiologists and to establish a basic understanding of this topic for the reader. We also discuss the impact that artificial intelligence might have on the field of radiology in the foreseeable future. Although artificial intelligence is unlikely to replace radiologists any time soon (if ever), we explore how this technology could be beneficial to radiologists.

## Introduction

Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing technical field positioned at the intersection of statistics and computer science. Artificial intelligence is currently used in many industries and has multiple applications in health care. Recently, there has been increased interest in applying artificial intelligence to medical imaging for a more accurate diagnosis of diseases. Consequently, radiology could become the first medical specialty significantly affected by this rapidly developing field.

Artificial intelligence technology has existed for more than 50 years and has become increasingly sophisticated. The British mathematician Alan Turing, who was one of the founders of modern computer science and artificial intelligence, largely reserved the phrase “artificial intelligence” for a technology that could broadly mimic the intelligence of humans, which later became popularized as the “Turing test” . The present revolution in data science started in early 2013 with the advent of IBM's Watson supercomputer, which has immense computing power and the ability to analyze images with astonishing speed and accuracy. The advances in this field have been partially attributed to the wide availability of computer graphics processing units, which have made parallel processing faster, cheaper, and more powerful, allowing for major improvements in image recognition. In 2015, IBM purchased Merge Healthcare, providing supercomputers access to a vast amount of existing medical records data for the purpose of training to improve their ability to read imaging studies, initiating the entrance of large corporations into the realm of automated image interpretation .

The terms “artificial intelligence,” “machine learning,” and “deep learning” have different meanings but are often used interchangeably. The purpose of this article was to define and clarify these fundamental terms for radiologists and to discuss the effects that artificial intelligence could have on the radiology profession in the near future. We also discuss how this technology may soon be beneficial to radiologists.

## Artificial Intelligence: Basic Terms and Principles

Before the advent of artificial intelligence, traditional computer programs relied on written lines of code to achieve a specific task. The computer did not “think” but simply performed the task as it was programmed to do. In recent years, advanced algorithms have allowed computers to make decisions autonomously. These computers are not explicitly instructed on the paths to use when performing specific tasks but rather rely on mathematical and statistical models to direct their decision-making to arrive at optimal solutions to problems. Artificial intelligence is the broadest way to consider this advanced computer intelligence. In 1956, at the Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference, this technology was described as follows: “Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can, in principle, be so precisely described, that a machine can be made to simulate it” .

Machine learning is one subfield of artificial intelligence. In 1959, Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in artificial intelligence research, defined machine learning as the “field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed” . By using statistical learning manipulations, computers can automatically discover patterns in input data. Unlike software programs that require specific instructions to complete a task, with machine learning, the computer system develops the ability to recognize patterns independently and make predictions. Machine learning is now being applied in multiple everyday applications, including data security, financial trading, marketing personalization, fraud detection, product recommendations, online searches, speech recognition, translation between languages, and smart cars.
