## Rationale and Objectives

Residency recruitment is a critical and expensive process. A program's Web site may improve recruitment, but little is known about how applicants use program sites or what constitutes optimal content. The importance of an interview day and interactions with a program's residents has been described, but candidate preferences for various activities and schedules have not been widely reported. We investigated contemporary use and perceived utility of information provided on radiology program Web sites, as well as preferences for the interview day experience.

## Materials and Methods

Using an anonymous cross-sectional survey, we studied 111 candidates who were interviewed between November 1, 2012 and January 19, 2013 for a diagnostic radiology residency position at our institution. Participation in this institutional review board–approved study was entirely voluntary, and no identifying information was collected. Responses were sealed and not analyzed until after the match.

## Results

A total of 70 candidates returned a completed survey (63% response rate). Optimal content considered necessary for a “complete” Web site was identified. The most important factor in deciding where to apply was geographical connection to a program. “AuntMinnie” was the most popular source of program information on social media. Candidates overwhelmingly preferred one-on-one faculty interviews but had no preference between a Saturday and weekday schedule. The ideal interview experience should include a “meet and greet” with residents off campus and a personal interview with the program director. The overall “feel” or “personality” of the program was critical to a candidate's rank order decision.

## Conclusions

Our findings offer insight into what factors make programs appealing to radiology applicants. This information will be useful to medical educators engaged in career counseling and recruitment.

Residency recruitment is a critical and expensive process during which applicants compete for residency positions and programs compete for the strongest candidates in the National Residency Matching Program (NRMP). An online presence is known to be an important source of program information for applicants , and a program's Web site may be the first impression a potential applicant has of a residency when deciding where to apply. Information essential for an accurate description of a structure and goals of the radiology program has not been described since brochures were the primary recruitment tool . More recent studies suggest that an easily navigated complete Web site may improve recruitment, but little is known about how applicants use program sites or what constitutes optimal content .

In competitive fields like radiology, program directors receive hundreds of applications from which they are expected to identify candidates most likely to match with their program . A large amount of subjective and objective information related to academic performance is transmitted to the program from the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS), but few correlations between performance in medical school and during residency have been established . As the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) step 1 score is the only objective comparative benchmark across the entire applicant pool, most program directors consider it very important for screening applicants . The one factor that is well known to be important to both programs and applicants is geographical connection .
