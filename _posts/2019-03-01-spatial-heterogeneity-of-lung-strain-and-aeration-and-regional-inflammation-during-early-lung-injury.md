## Introduction

Spatial heterogeneity of lung aeration and strain (change volume/resting volume) occurs at microscopic levels and contributes to lung injury. Yet, it is mostly assessed with histograms or large regions-of-interest. Spatial heterogeneity could also influence regional gene expression. We used positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to assess the contribution of different length-scales to mechanical heterogeneity and to direct lung injury biological pathway identification.

## Materials and Methods

Sheep exposed to mild ( _n_ = 5, supine and _n_ = 3, prone) and moderate ( _n_ = 6, supine) systemic endotoxemia were protectively ventilated. At baseline, 6 hours and 20 hours length-scale analysis was applied to aeration in CT (mild groups) and PET transmission (moderate group) scans; and voxel-level strain derived from image registration of end-inspiratory and end-expiratory CTs (mild). 2-deoxy-2-\[(18)F\]fluoro-d-glucose (  18 F-FDG)-PET kinetics parameters in ventral and dorsal regions were correlated with tissue microarray gene expression (moderate).

## Results

While aeration and strain heterogeneity were highest at 5–10 mm length-scales, larger length-scales contained a higher fraction of strain than aeration heterogeneity. Contributions of length-scales >5–10 mm to aeration and strain heterogeneity increased as lung injury progressed ( _p_ < 0.001) and were higher in supine than prone animals. Genes expressed with regional correlation to  18 F-FDG-PET kinetics (\|r\| = 0.81 \[0.78–0.85\]) yielded pathways associated with immune system activation and fluid clearance.

## Conclusion

Normal spatial heterogeneity of aeration and strain suggest larger anatomical and functional determinants of lung strain than aeration heterogeneity. Lung injury and supine position increase the contribution of larger length-scales.  18 F  − FDG-PET-based categorization of gene expression results in known and novel biological pathways relevant to lung injury.

## Introduction

Excessive mechanical forces can produce lung injury during mechanical ventilation. Indeed, regional strain (change in lung volume/resting lung volume) has been shown to relate to local lung inflammation particularly in the presence of systemic inflammation ( ). Excessive mechanical forces can occur not only at large lung areas of hyperinflation ( ) but also at the microscopic level. Experiments utilizing total lung capacity maneuvers in excised dog lobes revealed heterogeneity of regional gas volume changes in relation to gas volume at total lung capacity at length-scales as small as ∼2 mm ( ). In fact, pressure–volume relationships determining lung expansion are related to properties that scale down to the microscopic level of collagen and elastin fibers ( ). A theoretical study indicated that mechanical stress is significantly amplified around collapsed alveoli ( ). Despite the relevance of such small length-scale phenomena, most studies on pulmonary static and dynamic strain are based on whole lung ( ) or large regions-of-interest (ROI) ( ). Given that heterogeneity of lung expansion is relevant to lung injury, it is important to understand its topographic basis. Yet, information is scant on the length-scales contributing to strain and aeration heterogeneity during mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging and elastic registration allow for estimation of a range of such length-scale contribution by assessment of _in vivo_ regional tissue strain and aeration.

Lung injury results from complex interactions among mechanical and biological factors ( ). The inflammatory response to local and global stimuli includes recruitment of cells such as neutrophils and affects pulmonary regional metabolic activity, allowing for its _in vivo_ assessment with the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-deoxy-2-\[(18)F\]fluoro-d-glucose (  18 F-FDG) ( ). Recently, we showed that  18 F-FDG-PET could provide an early imaging biomarker for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) before this condition is clinically established, as well as guide tissue sampling for gene expression analysis ( ). Of note,  18 F-FDG-PET kinetics allows for estimation of parameters characterizing tissue phosphorylation rate, associated with tumor aggressiveness and response to therapy in oncological studies ( ) and with cytokine gene expression in experimental acute lung injury (ALI) ( ). Accordingly,  18 F-FDG-PET kinetics parameters could be a promising tool to guide the analysis of gene expression datasets and identify pathways relevant to the mechanism and treatment of ALI.

Landmark distance was used as a measure of overall image registration accuracy. Data correspond to two randomly selected supine sheep (S1 and S2) at the beginning (0 hour) and end of the experiment (24 hours). These time points were chosen because they represent the extremes in aeration and atelectasis. A measurement at 6 hours of a third sheep (S3) was added because it represented the study with the largest gas volume difference between inspiratory and expiratory images. An average of 95.8 points [range 74–122] were used for each animal-time point combination. Landmarks were semi-automatically matched in each pair of images by one observer.

The phosphorylation rate and tissue-specific 18 F-FDG uptake rate at 6 hours were significantly different from 20 hours (# p < 0.05 and ## p < 0.01) indicating that dorsal and ventral regions started and ended with similar levels, but followed different temporal trajectories.
