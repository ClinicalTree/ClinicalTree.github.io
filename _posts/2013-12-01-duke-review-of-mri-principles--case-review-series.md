The _Duke Review of MRI Principles_ is an excellent summary of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physics that is applicable for review purposes, preparation for board exams, and for anyone who is seeking a better understanding of MRI physics for clinical use. The book contains 17 chapters. Each examines a separate MRI principle from the basics, such as T1 and T2 weighting, through discussion of various MR artifacts to more advanced techniques such as MR spectroscopy and functional MRI.

Each chapter begins with one to two cases illustrating the topic to be discussed, along with several questions that allow readers to test their knowledge. The next page contains answers to the questions and a brief discussion of the cases. This is followed by a review of the physics pertaining to the MRI topic in question and several more cases illustrating different ways this particular MR principle applies to clinical practice. The chapter concludes with references and a nice bullet point summary of key points.

The authors do an excellent job with the physics discussions and are able to explain these complex topics in a concise manner that is relatively easy to understand and remember. In particular, I found the discussion of the purpose of magnetic gradients and the resultant artifacts to be very helpful. The chapters addressing MR angiography techniques and diffusion imaging were useful as well. The various cases in each chapter keep the physics discussion clinically relevant and provide concrete clinical examples of the physics principles addressed. Each case contains several images and for the most part the image quality is very good.

Overall, the book contains a nice mix of physics and clinical applications in a well-organized, relatively easy-to-read format. It is an ideal resource for radiology residents both as exam preparation and to gain a better understanding of MRI physics and the sequences seen in the reading room. Very little previous knowledge of MRI physics is required to gain value from this text, particularly the first few chapters. However, I would imagine that even fellows and practicing radiologists who are interested in furthering their knowledge of more advanced MRI techniques would also benefit from several of the later chapters.
