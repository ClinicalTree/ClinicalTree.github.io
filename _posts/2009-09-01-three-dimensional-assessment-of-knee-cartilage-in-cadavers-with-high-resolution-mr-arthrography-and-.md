## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography and multislice computed tomographic (MSCT) arthrography in the evaluation of the entire knee cartilage obtained from cadavers.

## Materials and Methods

MR arthrography and MSCT arthrography were performed on 16 cadaver knees, and their findings were compared to those found during macroscopic assessment. The sensitivity and specificity of MR arthrography and MSCT arthrography for detecting cartilage lesions of grade ≥ 2 and Spearman's correlation coefficients between arthrographic and macroscopic grades were determined. In addition, cartilage surface conspicuity of the two techniques was measured using a subjective ranking system.

## Results

The sensitivity and specificity, respectively, for the detection of cartilage disorder (grade ≥ 2) were 87% and 97% on MR arthrography and 84% and 99% on MSCT arthrography. There was no statistically significant difference between the two techniques in sensitivity ( _P_ = 1.000) or specificity ( _P_ = .625). Spearman's correlation coefficients between MR arthrography or MSCT arthrography and macroscopic grading were 0.783 and 0.800, respectively, with no statistically difference ( _P_ = .492). Both MR arthrography and MSCT arthrography enabled the accurate depiction of cartilage surface.

## Conclusions

High-resolution MR arthrography and MSCT arthrography were comparably accurate for the assessment of cartilage lesions of the entire knee.

Articular cartilage lesions are commonly seen in athletes and the elderly, but imaging the cartilage remains one of the most difficult and controversial areas in musculoskeletal imaging. Although conventional magnetic resonance (MR) has been regarded as the imaging modality of choice for the noninvasive assessment of articular cartilage, its efficiency had a strong dependence on the selected sequences, and limited performance in depicting cartilage lesions caused by relatively low resolution has been reported . Traditional computed tomographic (CT) arthrography and MR arthrography enable the relatively accurate depiction of cartilage lesions , but most of the reported trials studied the patellar cartilage , not the hyaline cartilage of the entire joint.

With the advent of multislice CT (MSCT) imaging, there have been remarkable advances in musculoskeletal imaging . MSCT imaging can be used to acquire isotropic or near isotropic data sets from which high–spatial resolution multiplanar reformatted images can be generated, so it is possible to evaluate the entire cartilage in a single MSCT arthrographic examination with three-dimensional high resolution. MSCT arthrography had been used in the evaluation of the entire hyaline cartilage in cadaver knees as well as the measurement of cartilage thickness in cadaver ankles . The findings of these previous studies showed that MSCT arthrography depicted cartilage more accurately than MR imaging.
