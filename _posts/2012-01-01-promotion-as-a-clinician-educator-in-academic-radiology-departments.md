Faculty promotion within an academic department of radiology may place emphasis on scientific research, administrative contributions, educational contributions, or a combination of all endeavors that enrich the department and further its academic mission. For those departments considering the establishment of a promotion pathway that emphasizes teaching talents and education-oriented research, the authors provide examples of three different clinician-educator faculty appointment and promotion schemes. Faculty development and defining scholarly work as a clinician-educator, as well as documentation of academic productivity within this pathway, are discussed.

Traditionally, American schools of medicine have placed importance on their faculty members’ contributions to scientific research when considering decisions regarding appointment or promotion. This trend has been shown to generate a sense of marginalization for clinicians who favor teaching over research . Over time, academic centers across a number of medical fields have recognized that skilled clinicians and teachers are vital components of a successful medical institution, leading to the definition of a clinician-educator . Very recently, clinician-educator curricular models for residents interested in teaching have been proposed in the internal medicine, psychiatry, and radiology literature .

Increasingly, medical school promotion committees are instituting separate criteria to evaluate clinician-educators’ performance . In a discussion of promoting good work, Gunderman made the point that “highly educated professionals such as radiologists need to feel that their work makes a difference, inspired by a clear sense of professional missions.” Clarifying an educator’s role in diagnostic radiology naturally creates standards by which a radiology clinician-educator may be promoted within a school of medicine. It is important that there be agreement on the definition of “scholarship within teaching.” With value clearly placed on educational activities, medical schools may attract and retain outstanding teachers by defining tracks and criteria for rewarding teaching efforts .

In this paper, we discuss clinician-educator promotion schemes for academic radiologists at three separate large schools of medicine in an effort to offer ideas for individuals serving on medical school committees charged with revising promotion criteria. The materials considered and the criteria for the promotion of physician faculty members for the schools of medicine at the three universities are described. Although this comparison paper may serve to provide some insight to those pursuing promotion, it is essential to note that each university has its own requirements for promotion and tenure, which each faculty member should review as early in his or her career as possible.

## Promotion tracks and criteria

## University of Washington School of Medicine

The University of Washington has well-defined academic appointments, most broadly categorized as regular faculty and research faculty (  Table 1 ). The duties of a research faculty member are primarily in research and, unless specified in an individual department, do not require participation in instructional programs. The appointment and promotion of regular faculty members, who perform duties combining clinical care, teaching, scholarship and service, are emphasized here.

University of Washington School of Medicine Faculty Appointments and Promotions are Divided into Regular (Physician) Faculty and Research (Basic Science) Faculty, According to the Descriptions Provided Here


Tracks Appointment Titles Duties Duration Regular (physician) faculty

Clinician-educator pathway

Traditional (physician scientist) pathway Assistant professor

Associate professor

Professor Clinician-educators devote majority of time in clinical care and teaching and the remaining time in scholarship

Traditional pathway clinicians balance teaching, scholarship, and service Assistant professors: 6 academic years with mandatory review for promotion in the sixth year

Associate and full professor: indefinite duration Research (basic science) faculty Research assistant professor

Research associate professor

Research professor Duties are primarily research

Research faculty members may participate in instructional programs, but are not required to do so Research assistant professors: 6 academic years with mandatory review for promotion in the sixth year

Research associate professor and research professor: appointment terms of up to 5 academic years with no limit to number of terms of renewal
