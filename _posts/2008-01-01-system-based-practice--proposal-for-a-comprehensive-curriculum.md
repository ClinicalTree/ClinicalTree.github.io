Systems-based practice (SBP) is the sixth competency of the required ACGME core competencies in US-based residency programs. SBP aims to ensure that residents ( ) are aware of a larger context and system of health care and ( ) have the ability to effectively call upon system resources to provide care of optimal value ( ). Therefore diagnostic radiology residency training programs must provide SBP education.

The core competencies were introduced in 1999 and implemented between 2001 and 2002 as part of the outcome project by ACGME ( ). The outcome project is still ongoing, currently in its second phase that aims at “sharpening the focus and definition of the competencies and assessment tools” ( ). The SBP competency has received far less attention than the other five competencies, mostly because of its less defined nature when compared to the others ( ). Little has been published about this requirement in radiology, and its implications remain relatively unexplored ( ). In a relatively recent report only 3% of senior medical students identified system-based practice as the most relevant competency during residency and later in their careers ( ).

Upon completion of residency training, radiologists are expected ( ) to demonstrate a knowledge of, and apply appropriate criteria and other cost-effective health care principles to professional practice, ( ) to understand the role of regulatory agencies and licensing regulations, and ( ) to have knowledge of financing and reimbursement methods. Even though the range of topic content in SBP is broad, in other specialties and academic institutions SBP has become a synonym of patient safety and community involvement; while these two are crucial aspects of SBP, in radiology finance, turf wars, and other issues must be addressed in order to avoid forfeiting important benefits for the profession. Each of the SBP domains has potential benefits for the radiologist-in-training. Given the increased complexity in the interaction between radiology and other sub-specialties, what was previously described as “noninterpretative skills” related to SBP have been recognized as extremely important to achieve financial and overall professional success ( ). Among these noninterpretative skills are practical business issues, appropriateness criteria, medical organizational politics, practice management, and contracting. The importance of these skills has gained attention in forums from the RSNA Research and Education Foundation, American College of Radiology (ACR), and the Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) ( ).

The purpose of this article is to review the significance of system-base practice in diagnostic radiology (SBR) training programs and to propose a comprehensive 2-year curriculum.

## Rationale

An underpinning of SBP is that systems are designed to achieve the results they achieve, that outcomes depend more on the system than on the individuals, and thus, a system must be changed to achieve improvement ( ). In addition, wider knowledge of the system and its components makes it easier to improve because the next generation will be better aware of pitfalls in today’s system. Put in other terms, today’s residents must be prepared for tomorrow’s practice. In this regard, system-based represents a pillar knowledge for highly functional practicing radiologists ( ).

Change is better accepted when it comes from among those individuals directly affected by the outcomes (i.e., health care providers and patients). Therefore, radiology trainees share in the responsibility of generating and participating in the process of improving radiology services quality and safety.
