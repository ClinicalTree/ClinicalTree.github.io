The newest addition from the popular _Case Review Series_ tackles the burgeoning specialty of emergency radiology. For those readers familiar with the series, the design and layout of this volume hold few surprises. The attractively bound paperback text is divided into three sections, each containing cases with images, diagnoses, and extended commentary. “Opening Round” covers the fundamental cases, while “Fair Game” and “Challenge” present cases in increasing gradations of difficulty. Cases include both traumatic and nontraumatic emergent imaging pathology.

The sequentially numbered cases begin with several high-quality images, in single or multiple modalities, with four accompanying questions. Answers conveniently located on the reverse of each page allow for self-assessment. A cross-reference to _Emergency Radiology: The Requisites_ allows the reader to easily pursue additional information on any given subject. The “Cited References” sections that follow provides another avenue for supplemental reading and include important literature or thoughtfully chosen, resident-friendly review articles. The final “Comment” sections provide cursory but pertinent and well-written overviews of case pathology.

With 200 cases, the book tackles its subject well, if not exhaustively. It particularly excels in its overview of common trauma, as it focuses on and furthers the coverage of trauma found in the other volumes in the _Case Review Series_ . The occasional overlap of diagnoses with other volumes represents an inevitable and forgivable shortcoming. Computed tomography and radiography constitute the majority of the images, followed by sonography; magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and nuclear medicine are used more infrequently, in accordance with common emergency practice and accessibility. The attractive color images provided sequentially before the “Opening Round” cases must be referenced, likely a concession to cost.

The text is educational and affords a solid case-based review of emergency radiology; however, for a resident who owns all other specialty-specific case review volumes, this text, while providing reinforcement, is not a necessity. Even so, it may substantially benefit residents training outside level 1 trauma centers. And for those who prefer self-assessing case-based formats, this is a fine addition to the growing library of the _Case Review Series_ .
