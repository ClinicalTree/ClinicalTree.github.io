## Rationale and Objectives

To describe the rationale, design, and technical background of coronary artery calcium (CAC) imaging in the large-scale population-based cardiovascular disease screening trial (Risk Or Benefit IN Screening for CArdiovascular Diseases \[ROBINSCA\]).

## Materials and Methods

First, literature search was performed to review the logistics, setup, and settings of previously performed CAC imaging studies, and current clinical CAC imaging protocols of participating centers in the ROBINSCA trial were evaluated. A second literature search was performed to evaluate the impact of computed tomography parameter settings on CAC score.

## Results

Based on literature reviews and experts opinion an imaging protocol accompanied by data management protocol was created for ROBINSCA. The imaging protocol should consist of a fixed tube voltage, individually tailored tube current setting, mid-diastolic electrocardiography-triggering, fixed field-of-view, fixed reconstruction kernel, fixed slice thickness, overlapping reconstruction and without iterative reconstruction. The analysis of scans is performed with one type and version of CAC scoring software, by two dedicated and experienced researchers. The data management protocol describes the organization of data handling between the coordinating center, participating centers, and core analysis center.

## Conclusion

In this paper we describe the rationale and technical considerations to be taken in developing CAC imaging protocol, and we present a detailed protocol that can be implemented for CAC screening purposes.

## Introduction

Early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) followed by evidence-based treatment could potentially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality . Extent of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong risk marker for coronary events, with evidence mainly derived from observational studies and from prospective nonrandomized studies . So far, there is no evidence that CAC imaging followed by treatment leads to a decrease in CVD morbidity and mortality as prospective randomized studies on CVD risk stratification based on CAC imaging combined with treatment are lacking. Consequently, European and North-American guidelines on CVD prevention still classify the evidence for CAC imaging at level IIb (“may be considered”) in asymptomatic adults at intermediate risk and mention that CAC imaging should not be uncritically used as a screening method . However, there is an ongoing debate on whether and how a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the risk or benefit of screening for CVD by CAC imaging should be performed . Issues related to RCT in CVD screening by CAC imaging, regarding radiation safety, imaging protocols, and privacy, and ethical and economic considerations, have been addressed by many experts in the field of CAC imaging . A well-described study design is essential when performing an RCT in CVD screening by CAC imaging. Moreover, in the case of such a trial, CAC imaging will most likely be performed in multiple centers involving many operators, technicians, and analysts. To use the CAC score as a quantitative imaging biomarker in a trial, the CAC score needs to be accurate, consistent, reliable, and valid across computed tomography (CT) platforms, clinical sites, and over time , demanding development of a robust and well-fitted imaging protocol.

In this paper we describe the rationale, design, and technical background of CAC imaging within the framework of the Dutch large-scale population-based cardiovascular screening trial, ROBINSCA (Risk Or Benefit IN Screening for CArdiovascular Diseases).
