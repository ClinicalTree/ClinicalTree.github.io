## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of the work described here was to determine the feasibility of monitoring Na  + concentration and distribution in muscle/skin during aerobic/anaerobic exercise with  23 Na magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

The Na  + concentration and water content of muscle/skin of the left lower leg of six healthy subjects (mean age, 26 years; range, 22–30 years; three men and three women) were assessed before and after aerobic/anaerobic cycle ergometry and during recovery with 3-T  23 Na/  1 H MRI.  23 Na MRI was performed with a custom-made knee coil. A gradient echo sequence with an acquisition time of 3.25 minutes, echo time of 2.07 ms, repetition time of 100 ms, and spatial resolution of 3 × 3 × 30 mm  3 was applied. Phantoms with increasing sodium concentration served for quantification via linear extrapolation. Blood values were determined by blood gas analysis.

## Results

The concentration of Na  + significantly increased during anaerobic exercise in all muscle compartments except the medial gastrocnemius muscle, whereas no significant change was observed in most muscle compartments during aerobic exercise (only the soleus muscle exhibited a significant increase in Na  + concentration during aerobic exercise: 1.6 ± 1.5 mmol/kg, 4.5%, _P_ = .046). During anaerobic exercise, the mean Na  + concentration of the triceps surae and the whole leg increased by 9.0% (3.1 ± 2.1 mmol/kg, _P_ = .016) and 6.5% (2.2 ± 1.3 mmol/kg, _P_ < .01). MRI revealed a water-independent increase in Na  + concentration in most muscle compartments during anaerobic exercise. Na  + concentration significantly decreased during recovery after anaerobic and aerobic exercise in all muscle compartments except the soleus. The Na  + concentration of the skin did not significantly change during anaerobic/aerobic exercise.

## Conclusions

Sodium  23 MRI allows reliable and noninvasive visualization and quantification of Na  + concentration and distribution in muscle and skin during exercise.  23 Na MRI can be used to gain new insights into Na  + homeostasis, presumably leading to better comprehension of pathophysiology.

The physiology of skeletal muscles can be examined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). After exercise, the skeletal muscle T2 relaxation value increases, resulting in a gain in signal intensity on T2-weighted  1 H MRI . The predominant cause is the intracellular accumulation of metabolites (eg, lactate) and the resulting osmotic shift of water from the extracellular to the intracellular space . Recently published studies indicate that  23 Na MRI has the potential to provide insight into muscle physiology . We have described the relevance of this regulatory system to salt-sensitive hypertension . Furthermore, in long-term balance studies by our group, we documented infradian rhythms in Na  + balance and excretion that are highly consistent with an additional Na  + storage compartment . We used carcass ashing and atomic absorption spectrometry, methods that clearly that have no human application . To study patients and normal subjects, we developed  23 Na MRI. We constructed a coil for  23 Na MRI with the upper calf as a target that allows skin, skeletal muscle, and bone to be investigated. In earlier studies, we validated the utility of this method in experimental animals and human subjects, including patients on hemodialysis .

It is well known that there are large concentration differences in sodium (Na  + ) and potassium (K  + ) between the intracellular and extracellular spaces, resulting in potential differences over membranes. In skeletal muscle, a low concentration of Na  + (10–30 mmol/L) and a high concentration of K  + (140 mmol/L) predominate intracellularly. In contrast, the extracellular concentrations are 145 mmol/L for Na  + and 4 mmol/L for K  + . Responsible for this gradient over the membrane is Na  + /K  + -ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase), which pumps 3 Na  + ions from the intracellular to the extracellular space and 2 K  + ions in the reverse direction. Muscle contraction–initiating action potentials cause a sudden influx of Na  + ions and efflux of K  + ions. During exercise, these ion shifts degrade the transmembrane gradients, leading to increasing loss of membrane excitability and muscle contractility, which are believed to be the main causes of muscle fatigue .
