## Rationale and Objectives

Development of imaging biomarkers often relies on their correlation with histopathology. Our aim was to compare two approaches for correlating pathology to multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (mpMRI) for localization and quantitative assessment of prostate cancer (PCa) index tumor using whole mount (WM) pathology (WMP) as the reference.

## Materials and Methods

Patients ( _N_ = 30) underwent mpMRI that included diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI at 3 T before radical prostatectomy (RP). RP specimens were processed using WM technique (WMP) and findings summarized in a standard surgical pathology report (SPR). Histology index tumor volumes (HTVs) were compared to MR tumor volumes (MRTVs) using two approaches for index lesion identification on mpMRI using annotated WMP slides as the reference (WMP) and using routine SPR as the reference. Consistency of index tumor localization, tumor volume, and mean values of the derived quantitative parameters (mean apparent diffusion coefficient \[ADC\], K  trans , and v  e ) were compared.

## Results

Index lesions from 16 of 30 patients met the selection criteria. There was WMP/SRP agreement in index tumor in 13 of 16 patients. ADC-based MRTVs were larger ( _P_ < .05) than DCE-based MRTVs. ADC MRTVs were smaller than HTV ( _P_ < .005). There was a strong correlation between HTV and MRTV (Pearson ρ > 0.8; _P_ < .05). No significant differences were observed in the mean values of K  trans and ADC between the WMP and SPR.

## Conclusions

WMP correlation is superior to SPR for accurate localization of all index lesions. The use of WMP is however not required to distinguish significant differences of mean values of quantitative MRI parameters within tumor volume.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) of the prostate has become an essential modality for staging and characterizing prostate cancer (PCa) . Current imaging protocols use multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI in addition to conventional T2- and T1-weighted imaging for a comprehensive assessment of PCa. The current recommendations for the clinical use of MRI rely on the qualitative assessment of the MR parameters , but much work is currently being done to refine mpMRI acquisitions, analyses, and validations to establish the clinical utility of quantitative prostate imaging. Each individual imaging sequence can provide unique and complementary quantitative measurements of the underlying physiology and pathophysiology of the prostate tissue, leading to improved detection of PCa . However, exactly what pathophysiology these quantitative measurements represent is not well established.

Development and validation of quantitative imaging tools requires correlation with established markers of the disease. A pathology-derived Gleason score remains the cornerstone for decision making with regard to therapy selection and disease prognosis . As such, numerous studies have been conducted to correlate quantitative mpMRI parameters with histology for the purposes of localizing the lesion and assessing its aggressiveness . Likewise, correlation with histology is also a necessary component in the validation of mpMRI as a means of response to therapy. However, the methods used for pathologic correlation vary widely, ranging from in-depth whole mount (WM) processing of the specimen followed by delineation of tumor foci by a pathologist directly on the glass sides and comparison to MRI data, to simply correlating MR images to the standard clinical pathology report. These two correlative pathology approaches are very different in terms of resources, expertise, and time involvement. WM pathology (WMP) correlation requires a technologist with expertise in WM fixation, embedding and sectioning, extensive pathologist involvement and is considered the “gold standard” for an imaging correlative approach. In contrast to standard pathologic processing used routinely, where individual cross-sections of the prostate are further cut into four quadrants or more, WMP allows for increased accuracy of the spatial mapping between pathology specimen and images, as axial sections of the prostate specimen are processed using large WM slides, which are marked to facilitate volumetric reconstruction of the specimen. The tumor areas are next contoured on each slide, thus simplifying spatial localization of the matching lesions in the imaging data. This in-depth correlative approach has been used by many . In contrast, a more common routine processing protocol provides pathology information necessary for clinical decision making, and including overall Gleason score and whether or not there is an extracapsular extension of tumor, it may include one- or two-dimensional measurement of the tumor area(s). As such, routine processing does not allow for volumetric reconstruction of the specimen, and so, three-dimensional volumes cannot be easily estimated. The surgical pathology report (SPR) is therefore not focused on providing detailed information for validating imaging studies. However, given the ubiquitous availability of SPR data, and the relatively low cost of implementing imaging correlative studies that rely on SPR, the practical question is whether SPR alone is sufficient for accurate localization of PCa. If the index lesion is correctly localized, it is unknown whether the assumed improvement in the accuracy of tumor delineation using WMP leads to significant differences in the tumor volume outlined, or differences in the quantitative MR parameters obtained.
