## Rationale and Objectives

Ductal changes are described as a finding of surrounding tissues in breast masses according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System – Ultrasound. However, ductal changes are often found as an isolated finding without a mass on ultrasound. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of abnormal ductal dilatations without masses on breast ultrasound.

## Materials and Methods

From August 2006 to August 2008, 75 pathologically verified pure ductal dilatations without associated masses on breast ultrasound were collected. Ultrasound findings including the diameter and length of the duct, the presence of ductal wall thickening and intraluminal content, the echo pattern of intraluminal content, and distribution were evaluated. The ultrasound findings were correlated with clinical and pathologic features, and radiologic differences between benign and malignant lesions were assessed using Fisher’s exact tests.

## Results

Of the 75 cases with abnormal ductal dilatations, seven (9%) were malignant, and four (5%) were atypical ductal hyperplasia. Ductal dilatations were longer in malignancies than in benign lesions ( _P_ < .05). Ductal wall thickening was more frequent in malignancies (100%) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (50%) than in other benign lesions (3%) ( _P_ < .05). Hypoechoic intraluminal content was more common in malignancies (86%) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (50%) than in other benign lesions (8%) ( _P_ < .05). Furthermore, a segmental distribution was more frequent in malignancies (43%) than in benign lesions (1%). Clinical symptoms were also frequent in malignancies (86%) than in benign lesions (4%) ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Abnormal ductal dilatations without masses have a 9% malignancy rate, and these would be recommended to undergo biopsy as suspicious abnormalities according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System – Ultrasound. Ultrasound has an essential role in the assessment of abnormal ducts for distinguishing benign and malignant ductal changes.

In the first edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) – Ultrasound, ductal changes are defined as abnormal caliber and/or arborization and belong to findings of surrounding tissues for breast masses . The significance and clinical management of ultrasound-detected ductal dilatations and the positive predictive value for malignancies or high-risk lesions have been less commonly reported in the past . Also, BI-RADS – Ultrasound does not provide detailed explanations about how to assess abnormal ducts, and it does not provide recommended clinical guidelines. The clinical significance of abnormal ductal dilatations on mammography or magnetic resonance imaging is known, and ductal dilatations have a wide spectrum of pathologic diagnoses, from benign lesions including fibrocystic changes, intraductal papilloma, or ductal hyperplasia to carcinomas . Recently, Hsu et al performed a retrospective study of dilated ducts on breast ultrasound and demonstrated that the positive predictive value for malignancy ranged from 9% to 43% according to the presence of associated masses, multiplicity, or intraductal content.

Pure ductal dilatations without associated masses of the breast are frequently found on breast ultrasound examinations, because ultrasound has been widely used as a screening modality or an adjuvant tool following mammography . Physicians often hesitate to decide on the possibility of malignancy when they encounter pure ductal dilatations on breast ultrasound because of the lack of previous studies and experience.
