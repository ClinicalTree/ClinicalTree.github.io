## Rationale and Objectives

Despite rapid adoption of the Hirsch index ( _h_ -index) as a measure of academic success, the correlations between the _h_ -index and other metrics of productivity remain poorly understood. The aims of this study were to determine whether _h_ -indices were associated with greater National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding success among academic radiologists.

## Materials and Methods

Using the Scopus database, _h_ -indices were calculated for a random sample of academic radiologists with the rank of professor. Using the NIH tool Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Reports, we determined the number, classification, and total years of NIH grant funding as principal investigator for each radiologist. Differences in _h_ -index, sorted by funding status, were determined using Wilcoxon's tests. Associations between _h_ -index and funding status were determined using logistic regression. Significant correlations between _h_ -index and grant metrics were determined using Spearman's ρ.

## Results

Among 210 professors of radiology, 48 (23%) secured at least one NIH grant. The mean _h_ -index was significantly higher among individuals who secured at least one NIH grant (19.1) compared to those who did not (10.4) ( _P_ < .0001). Professors with _h_ -indices < 10 compared to those with _h_ -indices > 10 were significantly less likely to receive NIH funding (odds ratio, 0.07; _P_ = .0321). However, _h_ -indices > 10 were not significantly predictive of greater funding. No significant relationships were observed between _h_ -index and the number of grant awards, years of prior funding, the amounts of grant awards, or grant classification.

## Conclusion

Having obtained at least one NIH grant was associated with a higher _h_ -index, yet multiple or large grants, such as those for program projects, were not predictive of higher _h_ -indices.

The publication of peer-reviewed journal articles remains one of the primary currencies by which one can assess productivity and success among academic physicians. A successful publication track record is essential for obtaining promotion at academic medical centers. Success can be defined by several measures, including the impact factor of the journal that publishes the work and the frequency with which peers cite the article in their own work. The Hirsch index ( _h_ -index) is a relatively novel metric of academic productivity that incorporates both number of publications as well as number of citations into a single value . Briefly, the _h_ -index equals the number of publications with at least _n_ citations. The _h_ -index is rapidly gaining favor as a means to assess the academic and scientific success of physicians and scientists, because it monitors the perceived importance of the authors' work through citation frequency rather than the importance of the journal as a whole .

Despite extensive interest in the _h_ -index, efforts to establish this publication measure as a metric of academic performance are incomplete. Previous work has shown that among academic radiologists, the _h_ -index was positively correlated with academic rank , yet the relationship between the _h_ -index and the propensity to secure research funding at academic radiology centers remains unclear. We focused this study on academic radiologists who had attained the rank of professor, because they represent the most experienced form of academic radiologist and thus are most likely to have contributed to the medical and scientific literature and to have sought research funding support. In the present study, we sought to determine if National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant funding status, including the type of awarded grant and the number of awarded grants, was correlated with the _h_ -index among professors of radiology.
