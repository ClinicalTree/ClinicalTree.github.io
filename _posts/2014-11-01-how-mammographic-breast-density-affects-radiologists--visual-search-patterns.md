## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the impact of mammographic breast density on the visual search process of radiologists when reading digital mammograms.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. A set of 149 craniocaudal digital mammograms were read by seven radiologists, and observer search patterns were recorded. Total time examining each case, time to first hit the lesion, dwell time, and number of hits per area were calculated. The nonparametric Mann–Whitney _U_ test was used for statistical evaluation.

## Results

In both low- and high-mammographic density cases, significant increases were observed in the time to first hit lesions when they were located outside, compared to overlying fibroglandular dense tissue ( _P_ = .001). Significantly longer dwell time ( _P_ = .003) and greater number of fixations ( _P_ = .0003) were observed when the lesions were situated within—rather than outside—the dense fibroglandular tissue.

## Conclusions

Increased mammographic breast density changes radiologists' visual search patterns. Dense areas of the parenchyma attracted greater visual attention in both high- and low-mammographic density cases, resulting in faster detection of lesions overlying the fibroglandular dense tissue, along with longer dwell times and greater number of fixations, as compared to lesions located outside the dense fibroglandular regions.

Mammography is the only proven screening tool for early detection of breast cancer, and it has been shown to significantly decrease breast cancer mortality . Mammograms display the main components of the breast, namely adipose and fibroglandular connective tissues, with the latter appearing whiter than the former because of increased attenuation properties . Mammographic density refers to the proportion of fibroglandular tissue that is displayed relative to the remaining parts of the breast.

It is well reported that, with film technology, high mammographic density reduces the radiologists' ability to detect cancer, as sensitivity decreased from 80%–98% in fatty breasts to 29.2%–75% in dense breasts . This led to greater numbers of missed cancers , interval cancers , recall rates , and screen-detected tumors of >15 mm in size . Moreover, mammographic specificity was lower in dense breasts , decreasing from 96.9% in women with almost entirely fatty breasts to 89.1% in extremely dense breasts .
