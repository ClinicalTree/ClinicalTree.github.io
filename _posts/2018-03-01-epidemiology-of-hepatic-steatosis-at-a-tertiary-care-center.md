## Rationale and Objectives

Little is known about the frequency and risk factors of hepatic steatosis in the tertiary care setting. Such knowledge is essential to clinicians making decisions about testing for this condition. Thus, our aim was to describe the epidemiology of hepatic steatosis, as captured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), at a tertiary care center.

## Materials and Methods

A near-consecutive cohort of 1006 adult patients underwent standard-of-care liver MRIs. Images were retrospectively processed to derive proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps. Data from three spatially distinct regions of interest (ROIs) were aggregated to derive overall hepatic PDFF values. Demographic, anthropometric, clinical, and laboratory variables were included in a multivariate analysis to determine predictors of hepatic steatosis grades (based on established PDFF cutoffs). Hepatic steatosis grades derived from single vs aggregated ROIs were compared.

## Results

Hepatic steatosis was observed in 25% of patients (19% grade 1; 3% grade 2; 3% grade 3). Controlling for all other variables, the odds of hepatic steatosis increased by 7%–9% ( _P_ <  .001) for each whole point increase in body mass index (BMI), whereas elevated serum bilirubin was associated with lower odds of hepatic steatosis ( _P_ = .002). Race, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome were not independently predictive of hepatic steatosis when controlling for other variables (eg, BMI). Employing single ROIs (rather than three aggregated ROIs) resulted in incorrect steatosis grading in up to 8.0% of patients.

## Conclusion

Many adult patients undergoing liver MRI at a tertiary care center have hepatic steatosis, with larger BMIs as the only independent predictor of higher grades. This information can be used by clinicians at such centers to make evidence-based decisions about when to test for hepatic steatosis in their patients.

## Introduction

Hepatic steatosis, the abnormal accumulation of lipids within hepatocytes, is a common condition affecting roughly 20%–30% of the population in Western countries . Etiologies of hepatic steatosis have typically been partitioned into nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic fatty liver disease. Importantly, the prevalence of NAFLD, which has been linked to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, has risen sharply in recent decades, in tandem with the obesity epidemic . Even in the absence of cirrhosis, hepatic steatosis is a risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma and is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease .

The detection of hepatic steatosis is important in guiding clinical management. The current gold standard for diagnosing and grading hepatic steatosis is nontargeted percutaneous biopsy with direct histologic visualization . Although generally safe, percutaneous liver biopsy is an invasive procedure with non-negligible risks of hospitalization (3%) and death (0.01%), with even higher risks of complications in patients with advanced liver disease . Moreover, fat deposition within the hepatic parenchyma can exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity, potentially resulting in undergrading or overgrading due to sampling error . Consequently, there is a need for safe and accurate methods of globally interrogating hepatic fat levels. With the advent of multiecho chemical shift-encoded sequences, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as a reliable, noninvasive means of liver fat quantification .

![Figure 2, Bar graph ( a ) shows the distribution of hepatic siderosis grades among the various grades of hepatic steatosis, with a significant association ( P < .001) between higher siderosis grades and higher steatosis grades. Linear regression ( b ) demonstrates a very weak ( R 2 = 0.01) but significant ( P < .001) positive correlation between mean proton density fat fraction (PDFF) values (a marker of steatosis) and mean field strength-adjusted R2* values (a marker of siderosis). Note that the 20–25 patients with the highest mean field strength-adjusted R2* values (ie, >200) fell at the low end of the range of mean PDFF values ( bracket ), in part related to the much greater frequency of low PDFF values in our study population.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EpidemiologyofHepaticSteatosisataTertiaryCareCenter/1_1s20S1076633217304051.jpg)
