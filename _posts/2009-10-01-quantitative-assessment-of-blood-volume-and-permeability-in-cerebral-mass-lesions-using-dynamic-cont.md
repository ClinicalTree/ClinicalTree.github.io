## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate cerebral blood volume (CBV) and permeability (PS) in spontaneously occurring cerebral neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in dogs using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT).

## Materials and Methods

Dogs presenting with spontaneous intracranial lesions ( _n_ = 16) underwent DCE-CT at the level of the lesion followed by a histologically confirmed diagnosis from a CT-guided stereotactic biopsy. Data post-processing was performed with commercially available CT software (GEMS Advantage Workstation 4.2). Symmetric regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn within the lesion and unaffected areas on the contralateral side. Values were compared between lesion types and ratios of lesion-to-normal brain were calculated.

## Results

Dogs with extra-axial lesions ( _n_ = 3 meningiomas) had marked elevation of CBV and PS compared to normal brain. All Grade III gliomas ( _n_ = 5) had mildly elevated CBV and markedly elevated PS values. All lower Grade II gliomas ( _n_ = 2) had minimal elevation in CBV and PS. Dogs with non-neoplastic intra-axial lesions (one each necrotizing, fungal, and lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis) had elevation of PS with normal to mildly elevated CBV. Lesion-to-normal brain ratios for PS separated extra- and intra-axial neoplasms and intra-axial inflammatory/degenerative lesions from each other.

## Conclusions

Low-grade gliomas do not consistently demonstrate elevated vascular parameters, whereas Grade III gliomas and non-neoplastic intra-axial lesions have elevated PS. Ratios between such lesions and normal brain may prove useful for differentiating types of lesions. These findings resemble those previously reported in similar lesions in people indicating that the dog may act as a good model for intracranial masses for the study of lesion angiogenesis and response to therapy.

The role of angiogenesis in tumor growth has become increasingly clear . Angiogenesis is a complex process whereby increasing vascular density results in delivery of oxygen and nutrients to rapidly dividing tumor cells . Endothelial cells of tumor vessels are abnormal with large gaps allowing for extravasation of large particles. Elevated vascular density and increased permeability have been correlated with more aggressive tumor behavior in a variety of tumor types including gliomas . In recent years, anti-angiogenic drugs have been developed and are in various stages of clinical implementation in hopes of halting tumor growth through the inhibition of angiogenesis . The use of these agents has necessitated the development of noninvasive imaging techniques that can be serially repeated to assess angiogenic indicators such as vascular volume and permeability.

Recent developments in image processing have focused on deriving functional and molecular information from medical imaging. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging techniques require serial acquisition of images in the same anatomic location during intravenous contrast administration, thereby allowing observation and quantification of the first pass of iodinated contrast media through the vasculature . This can be done using either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By measuring the rate of contrast enhancement in an input artery and an output vein and using deconvolution methods, the values of cerebral blood volume (CBV) and vascular permeability (PS) can be extrapolated . DCE-MRI has been used in experimental rodent models and in people to monitor brain tumor angiogenesis and response to anti-angiogenic agents, and changes in tumor permeability and vascular volume have been shown to correlate with response to therapy . CT provides several advantages over MRI including superior temporal resolution, more accessibility, less expense, and increased efficiency. Data processing is simplified with CT because, unlike MRI, there is a linear correlation between contrast agent concentration and signal intensity . DCE-CT has been used to quantify blood flow characteristics in experimental animal models and people with a variety of intracranial tumors . This method has compared favorably to gold standard techniques such as using microspheres to evaluate brain tumors in rodent models .
