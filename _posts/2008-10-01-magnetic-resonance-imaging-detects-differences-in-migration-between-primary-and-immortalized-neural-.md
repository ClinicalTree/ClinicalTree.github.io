## Rationale and Objectives

The study was performed to evaluate the effect of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent (super paramagnetic iron oxide \[SPIO\]) on differentiation and migration of primary murine neural stem cells (NSCs) in comparison to a neural stem cell line (C17.2). Because detection of labeled cells depends on the concentration of SPIO particles per imaging voxel, the study was performed at various concentrations of SPIO particles to determine the concentration that could be used for in vivo detection of small clusters of grafted cells.

## Materials and Methods

Murine primary NSCs or C17.2 cells were labeled with different concentrations of SPIO particles (0, 25, 100, and 250 μg Fe/mL) and in vitro assays were performed to assess cell differentiation. In vivo MRI was performed 7 weeks after neonatal transplantation of labeled cells to evaluate the difference in migration capability of the two cell populations.

## Results

Both the primary NSCs and the C17.2 cells differentiated to similar number of neurons (Map2ab-positive cells). Similar patterns of engraftment of C17.2 cells were seen in transplanted mice regardless of the SPIO concentration used. In vivo MRI detection of grafted primary and C17.2 cells was only possible when cells were incubated with 100 μg/mL or higher concentration of SPIO. Extensive migration of C17.2 cells throughout the brain was observed, whereas the migration of the primary NSCs was more restricted.

## Conclusions

Engraftment of primary NSCs can be detected noninvasively by in vivo MRI, and the presence of SPIO particles do not affect the viability, differentiation, or engraftment pattern of the donor cells.

Stem cells have the ability to differentiate into specific cell types. They have been used in several preclinical models of disease ( ) and are being used in Phase I–III clinical trials ( ). Neural stem cells (NSCs) can differentiate into neuronal or glial cells and express trophic factors to rescue dysfunctional brain tissue ( ). These properties of NSCs provide an opportunity to use them as delivery vehicles for therapeutic molecules into specific regions or into the entire brain ( ). Stem cell lines are generally used for investigation of basic properties of stem cells. One of the commonly used NSC lines, known as C17.2, was originally derived from neonatal mouse cerebellum and immortalized by the introduction of a _v-myc_ oncogene ( ). When transplanted into the developing brain, this cell line consistently results in robust and stable engraftment throughout the brain. Because this line does not usually lead to formation of tumors, it has been extensively used in transplantation biology studies, including treatment of mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases ( ). However, use of neural stem cell lines for treatment of diseases in humans is potentially problematic because of their immortalized nature. An earlier study suggested that the biology of C17.2 cells differs significantly from primary neural stem cells ( ); therefore, it is important to assess the transplantation and migration properties of primary stem cells in experimental models.

Stem cell engraftment is generally determined postmortem by histologic, immunologic, or fluorescence assays. However, to evaluate the efficacy of stem cell migration and survival over time, it is necessary to use noninvasive techniques. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been applied to monitor implanted stem cells by loading the cells with iron oxide particles as a contrast agent ( ). The particles exhibit strong magnetic moments when placed in a magnetic field and create a hypointense (dark) signal on MRI. Based on their size, these agents can be broadly classified into three categories; ultra-small paramagnetic iron oxide particles (USPIO, 10–30 nm), super paramagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO, 30–150 nm) and micrometer-sized paramagnetic iron oxide particles (0.5–2 μm). The SPIO particles are more commonly used ( ) because they are commercially available and have been used in the clinic for the detection of liver tumors ( ) and have recently been shown to be efficient in the detection of implanted cells in humans ( ).
