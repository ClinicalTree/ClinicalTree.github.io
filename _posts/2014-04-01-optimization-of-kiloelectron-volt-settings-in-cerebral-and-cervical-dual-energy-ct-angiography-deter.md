## Rationale and Objectives

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) offers various fields of application, especially in angiography using virtual monoenergetic imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate objective image quality indices of calculated low–kiloelectron volt monoenergetic DECT angiographic cervical and cerebral data sets compared to virtual 120-kV polyenergetic images.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-one patients (21 men, mean age 58 ± 14) who underwent DECT angiography of the cervical ( _n_ = 7) or cerebral vessels ( _n_ = 34) were retrospectively included in this study. Data acquired with the 80 and 140 kVp tube using dual-source CT technology were subsequently used to calculate low-kiloelectron volt monoenergetic image data sets ranging from 120 to 40 keV (at 10-keV intervals per patient). Vessel and soft tissue attenuation and image noise were measured in various regions of interest, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was subsequently calculated. Differences in image attenuation and CNR were compared between the different monoenergetic data sets and virtual 120-kV polyenergetic images.

## Results

For cervical angiography, 60-keV monoenergetic data sets resulted in the greatest improvements in vessel attenuation and CNR compared to virtual 120-kV polyenergetic data sets (+40%, +16%; all _P_ < .01). Also for cerebral vessel assessment, 60-keV monoenergetic data sets provided the greatest improvement in vessel attenuation and CNR (+40%, +9%; all _P_ < .01) compared to virtual 120-kV polyenergetic data sets.

## Conclusions

60-keV monoenergetic image data significantly improve vessel attenuation and CNR of cervical and cerebral DECT angiographic studies. Future studies have to evaluate whether the technique can lead to an increased diagnostic accuracy or should be used for dose reduction of iodinated contrast material.

The clinical and experimental applications of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) imaging continue to expand. DECT acquires data sets at two different energy levels and uses the differential x-ray absorption characteristics of different materials to identify and map various components within an image. This includes urate crystals, calcium, and iodine. Accordingly, DECT techniques have been used in a range of scenarios, including tissue perfusion analysis in cardiology and oncology, gout imaging, renal cyst characterization, and bone/calcified atherosclerotic plaque subtraction . DECT has been specifically applied in head and neck CT angiography for bone and plaque removal to improve the accuracy of intracranial hemorrhage detection and to identify the underlying etiology of intracranial hematomas .

DECT may also have a role in improving the image quality of head and neck CT angiography. In most cases, a 120-kVp single-energy equivalent series is reconstructed from the two DECT data sets. Like standard single-energy CT, these images are created from a polyenergetic x-ray spectrum with the peak energy represented by the kVp. It is possible, however, to use DECT basis material decomposition and the knowledge of specific linear attenuation coefficients to calculate the expected mass attenuation coefficient for each voxel at any energy level, resulting in “virtual monoenergetic” images (MEIs). Considering the impact of tube energy settings on radiation dose, noise, attenuation, and overall image quality, this added DECT-based functionality might provide several advantages compared to the traditional reconstructions. Contrast-enhanced vessel attenuation increases with decreasing x-ray energies (down to the K-edge of iodine, 33 keV) . It has been shown that lower energy acquisitions can lead to better image quality and reduction of contrast material administration . Similar results were found in CT pulmonary angiographic studies using DECT, in which low-kiloelectron volt MEIs allowed iodine load reduction while improving vascular attenuation and maintaining signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) compared to single-energy CT .
