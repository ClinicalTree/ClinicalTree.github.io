## Rationale and Objectives

To assess whether dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography improves vascular contrast beyond MDCT angiography and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) while preserving the ability to precisely characterize stenoses, using DSA as reference standard.

## Materials and Methods

This prospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant, institutional review board–approved study was performed on 25 patients referred for lower extremity DECT angiography and subsequent DSA. Spectral data were postprocessed to create single-energy 120 kVp (MDCT series) and iodine-only (DECT series) datasets. The arterial tree was subdivided into 11 anatomical levels. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) and corresponding coefficient -of variation (CV) of patent vessel segments were evaluated for DECT, MDCT, and DSA using analysis of variance comparisons. Degree of stenoses was determined for DECT, MDCT, and DSA and correlated with _t_ -test, bivariate Pearson comparisons, and Bland-Altman plots.

## Results

Patent vasculature comprised 230 vessel segments. From infrarenal aorta to distal femoral arteries, DECT showed higher CNR compared to DSA and MDCT ( _P_ < .05); distal to the popliteal arteries, DSA achieved higher CNR ( _P_ < .05). Analyses of contrast homogeneity showed minimal CV above the knee for MDCT (≤9%) and for DSA below the knee (≤7%). Stenotic vasculature comprised 33 segments. Significant correlations of stenosis severity were found comparing DECT and MDCT with DSA as reference standard showing a 0.04-fold mean underestimation of stenoses on MDCT and no detectable mean variation on DECT compared with DSA.

## Conclusion

DECT angiography improved contrast in vascular abdominopelvic and thigh distributions beyond MDCT angiography and DSA while preserving the ability to precisely assess severity of stenoses, using DSA as an accepted reference standard.

Traditionally, peripheral arterial disease has been evaluated with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography, however, represents a noninvasive alternative to conventional DSA for the evaluation of the peripheral arterial vasculature as MDCT angiography requires a less invasive technique for contrast agent administration and, furthermore, allows evaluation of the vascular lumen as well as vessel wall . DSA employs a precontrast mask to mathematically eliminate extraluminal anatomy. MDCT angiography uses threshold-based postprocessing techniques to extract vascular anatomy, which are, however, inherently nonspecific to types of contrast agents and further compromised by beam hardening phenomena originating from mural calcifications and vascular stents .

Selective iodine extraction with beam hardening correction through pixel-by-pixel data postprocessing has become possible with dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) technology. In DECT imaging, 2 x-ray beams of distinct and known energy spectra are tuned to the characteristic absorption profiles of injected contrast materials. This technology may enable selective contrast agent extraction and, furthermore, correct for beam hardening phenomena without substantially increasing the radiation dose to the patient . Prior studies have shown qualitatively DECT angiography to improve sensitivity and specificity for detecting peripheral arterial disease in the lower extremities compared to MDCT angiography and DSA .
