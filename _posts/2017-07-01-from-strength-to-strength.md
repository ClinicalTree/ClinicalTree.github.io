In July 2017, the Association of University Radiologists and its journal, _Academic Radiology_ , will be blessed by the appointment of Reed Dunnick, MD, as the journal's new Editor in Chief. Dr. Dunnick was selected after a national search that included many outstanding candidates and will become the seventh Editor of the AUR's official journal.

Dr. Dunnick will succeed Dr. Stanley Baum in this post. The AUR owes Dr. Baum a huge debt of gratitude for his outstanding leadership of the journal for the past 17 years. During Dr. Baum's tenure as Editor in Chief, the journal has grown and diversified. It continues to attract outstanding research article submissions and several special issues each year are devoted to other academic topics ranging from teaching to health care policy. The journal's impact factor (a measure of how frequently its articles are cited by others) has steadily increased. Dr. Baum pursued his responsibilities as a “labor of love” for our academic radiology community, and the result speaks for itself.

Dr. Dunnick is one of the world's outstanding academic radiologists, with an enormous array of scientific accomplishments and leadership positions in our most important organizations. Dr. Dunnick completed his Radiology residency at Stanford in 1976 and then spent four formative years as a Staff Radiologist at the NIH. In 1980, he joined the radiology faculty at Duke and became Professor of Radiology in just 4 years. In 1992, he became Chair of the Department of Radiology at the University of Michigan Health System and became the Fred Jenner Hodges Professor of Radiology at Michigan, positions he holds today.

The list of honors and awards that Dr. Dunnick has received over his professional lifetime is enormous, and we can list only a few highlights here. He has received Gold Medals from ARRS, the Society of Uroradiology, the AUR, the Michigan Radiological Society, and the ACR, as well as a Visionary Leadership award from SCARD.
