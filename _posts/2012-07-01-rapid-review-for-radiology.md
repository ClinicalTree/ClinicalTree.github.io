The first 2010 edition of rapid review for radiology is an excellent resource for radiology residents in general and final year residents preparing for boards in particular.

The book has six sections that include Chest, Abdomen, Central Nervous System (including head and neck), MSK, Pediatrics, and Breast.

The book is in a case format and every chapter has approximately 35 to 40 cases that are then described under the headings of observations, diagnosis, differential, discussion, further management, and further reading.

The cases chosen for different sections are representative of individual disease manifestations and represent classic radiology boards cases. For example, the chest section has 37 and the Central Nervous System section has 29 classic Boards style “Aunt Minnie” cases with nicely enumerated differentials.

The further management section makes this book stand out from the other case reviews as it is one of the sections that the residents taking ABR are expected to know. Similarly, in the general introduction section at the beginning of the book, there is a good review on how to take oral cases and prepare for them.

Ultrasound, nuclear radiology, and interventional radiology are not covered in this book as separate chapters. There are a few cases of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in the chest section, but cardiac radiology is not covered as a separate chapter.
