## Rationale and Objectives

Cross-sectional imaging is being increasingly proposed as a suitable tool to characterize carotid plaques. The aim of this work was to correlate the Doppler velocity parameters with the cross-sectional percent stenosis (CPoS) of internal carotid artery (ICA) and to identify the cutoff values of these parameters in five progressive classes of stenosis area severity (ie, 40%–49%, 50%–59%, 60%–69%, 70%–79%, 80%–90%).

## Materials and Methods

High-quality scans from 90 patients (mean age, 74 ± 9 years) with 43%–90% ICA stenosis were analyzed. ICA peak-systolic (PSV) and end-diastolic (EDV) velocities were measured at maximum stenosis level. Total ICA area and residual lumen (RL) were measured to derive the CPoS. A simple physical model described by the equation Velocity = Flow rate/Area was considered. Effectively, the CPoS is expected to negatively correlate with the inverse of velocity parameters, assuming flow rate to be constant. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to investigate the relationships between velocity and echographic measures.

## Results

With CPoS as the dependent variable, the first significant regressor was the inverse ICA-EDV ( _r  2_ = 0.64; _P_ < .0001) followed by inverse ICA-PSV ( _r  2_ = 0.43; _P_ < .0001). ICA-EDV mean values throughout five progressive classes of stenosis were: 28 cm/second for 40%–49% stenosis, 35 cm/second for 50%–59%, 43 cm/second for 60%–69%, 69 cm/second for 70%–79%. and 103 cm/second for 80%–90%. ICA-PSV mean values were: 97 cm/second for 40%–49%, 110 cm/second for 50%–59%, 136 cm/second for 60%–69%, 224 cm/second for 70%–79%, and 286 cm/second for 80%–90%.

## Conclusion

ICA-EDV is the parameter that better correlates with CPoS. Nevertheless, ICA-PSV maintained a highly significant correlation with CPoS. Moreover, the categorization of Doppler parameters in five progressive classes of severity of stenosis could provide physicians with an easily accessible tool in clinical practice, complementary to the morphological evaluation of cross-sectional stenosis.

Carotid stenosis is a target for stroke prevention interventions and potentially a target for population screening campaigns. Characterizing carotid stenosis is useful in risk stratification and is helpful in selecting the most appropriate risk-reducing interventions for individual patients. Medical intervention to reduce risk has become very effective ; hence, reproducible methods to characterize stenosis severity may help in monitoring the effectiveness of medical intervention. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate methods to detect and characterize carotid plaques, including degree of stenosis in an accurate, reproducible, safe, and accessible way. Traditionally, the degree of stenosis in internal carotid artery (ICA) has been measured by means of conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Today, the latter has been largely replaced by noninvasive tools, such as duplex ultrasound (DUS), minimally invasive computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) , because conventional angiography is relatively dangerous (eg, embolic risk, allergic reactions, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, groin hematoma), expensive, and relatively difficult to perform because of the limiting use to tertiary referral centers. Moreover, when using conventional angiography, degree of stenosis is defined by means of one to three longitudinal views of the lumen, which limits accuracy and reproducibility of the evaluation, and little information is provided about cross-sectional plaque characteristics. Actually, degree of stenosis was traditionally defined by using conventional angiography methods, mainly by means of NASCET (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) and ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trial)-derived parameters . Several discrepancies have been shown between these two methods , generating confusion in the application of their recommendations to clinical practice . Furthermore, longitudinal measurements may lead to a suboptimal evaluation of the hemodynamic meaning of the stenosis, at least in those (not unusual) cases where sectional morphology of arteries with plaques is irregular . Therefore, cross-sectional area would be a more accurate parameter than longitudinal measurements to infer the real residual blood flow velocities through a stenosed artery , especially in evaluating those stenoses with a noncircular lumen . When properly validated, cross-sectional imaging might indeed replace the conventional gold standard to better characterize carotid plaque.

Indeed, when the plaque surface and/or vessel wall borders were well identifiable, DUS cross-sectional area evaluation could be a reliable tool in order to define the degree of ICA stenosis. This has been supported by gross pathological studies showing that cross-sectional area, even if measured by means of DUS, is more accurate than longitudinal measurements versus the gold standard of fixed histological endarterectomy specimens . Actually, DUS is the most widely used screening and diagnostic technique because of its limited cost and sufficient accuracy, especially for the detection of carotid bifurcation plaques . It is more accessible and less risky than contrast MRA and contrast CTA. Moreover, DUS is reliable in assessing stenosis . It is noninvasive, less expensive, and may be easily performed in an emergency setting .
