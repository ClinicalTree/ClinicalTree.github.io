## Rationale and Objectives

To compare time to interpretation and diagnostic performance levels during repeat readings of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) in a retrospective study.

## Materials and Methods

Three experienced radiologists twice interpreted 125 selected examinations, 35 with verified cancers and 90 negative for cancer during a period of 22 months using FFDM alone followed by a combined FFDM + DBT mode. Changes in time to “review and rate” these examinations as well as in diagnostic performance levels where assessed. A fixed-effect analysis accounting for cross-correlation due to the review of the same examinations by the same readers was performed.

## Results

The total (combined) time to review and rate an examination increased on average by 33% between the first and second readings of the same examinations ( _P_ < .001). Radiologists reduced their time to review FFDM before making the DBT available for viewing. However, they spent more time reviewing the combined FFDM + DBT mode. The recall rates for examinations depicting cancer remained largely unchanged. Among the groups of examinations with concordant and discordant recall recommendations during the two readings only the group examinations that were “newly recalled” during repeat reading, took significantly longer ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusion

DBT-based breast imaging may ultimately result in a substantial increase in performance; however, without efficiency improvements DBT may take longer to interpret. Addition of “false-positive recalls” was most strongly associated with increase in interpretation time while elimination of “false-positive recalls” did not require longer interpretation time.

With the anticipated availability of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) imaging systems for three-dimensional breast examinations , there are a number of questions related to acquisition, operation, training, and display that need to be addressed if DBT is to be optimally incorporated into the clinical practice. DBT is of great interest in screening, as well as in diagnostic procedures since it enables three-dimensional reconstruction, thus allowing cross-sectional visualization of breast tissue. This increase in visualization reduces the difficulty associated with interpretations of projection mammograms because of superposition or “overlapping” tissue. Several studies have addressed technical, ergonomic, and performance issues associated with DBT, but to date there are no data from prospective clinical studies. The results from retrospective or a number of primarily subjective assessments are quite encouraging but inconclusive . In two retrospective studies performed in our laboratory, the time to interpret examinations using either DBT alone or full-field digital mammography (FFDM) + DBT combined was longer than when interpreting FFDM . Because the issue of “insufficient training and familiarity with DBT” was raised as one possible reason for substantially longer review times with DBT-based systems, in particular as related to the possible use of DBT in the screening environment where efficiency is of great importance, we performed a repeat reading study in which three experienced radiologists read the same set of 125 examinations twice under the same reading mode. We present here the results of this very preliminary study, albeit potentially important in terms of highlighting an issue that we feel needs to be better understood and adequately addressed.

## Materials and methods

## General Study Design

The digital mammography images used in this study, consisting of FFDM images and DBT image sets, have been described in detail elsewhere . In brief, images were acquired with standard tomosynthesis acquisition techniques, which generated 11 low-dose projection images, or frames, acquired for reconstruction of DBT image sets. After acquisition, the data from the frames were used to reconstruct 50–90 parallel slices 1 mm thick, depending on the thickness of the compressed breast. The radiation dose associated with the series of low-dose projection images was the same as that of a projection mammogram with average mid-breast dose of approximately 2 mGy per view. The acquisition of all examinations was performed under Institutional Review Board–approved protocols that included a signed informed consent by the participant. The reading study used an FFDM alone mode and a “combined” mode (FFDM + DBT).
