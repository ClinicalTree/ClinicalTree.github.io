## Rationale and Objectives

Three-dimensional (3D) velocity-encoded cine (VEC) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to quantify 3D hemodynamic aspects known from computational fluid dynamics and to be used to identify hemodynamic risk factors for complications of endovascular aortic repair. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of an aortic nickel-titanium (nitinol) stent graft on the accuracy of flow measurements by 3D VEC MRI.

## Materials and Methods

A pump generated pulsatile aortic flow in an elastic tube phantom mimicking the aorta. Stacked two-dimensional three-directional VEC MRI (stacked-2D-3dir-MRI), 3D three-directional VEC MRI (3D-3dir-MRI), and gold-standard 2D through-plane VEC MRI were applied before and after the insertion of an aortic nitinol stent graft. Six equidistant levels were analyzed twice by the same reader. The percentage difference of the measured flow rate from the gold standard was defined as the parameter of accuracy.

## Results

The overall accuracy of in-stent flow measurements related to the gold standard was −5.4% for stacked-2D-3dir-MRI and −4.1% for 3D-3dir-MRI, demonstrating significant overall underestimation compared to the gold standard ( _P_ = .016 and _P_ = .013). However, flow measurements with the stent graft were significantly overestimated by 4.1% using stacked-2D-3dir-MRI ( _P_ < .001) and by 5.4% using 3D-3dir-MRI ( _P_ = .003) compared to identical measurements without the stent graft. In stacked-2D-3dir-MRI, this positive bias was significantly greater at the proximal and distal ends of the stent graft ( _P_ = .025). In 3D-3dir-MRI, measurements along the whole length of the stent graft were affected ( _P_ = .006). Intraobserver agreement was excellent, with intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.94 for stacked-2D-3dir-MRI ( _P_ < .001) and 0.90 for 3D-3dir-MRI ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Flow measurements within an aortic nitinol stent graft by 3D VEC MRI are feasible, but stent grafts may cause a significant positive bias.

Endovascular repair (EVR) of the thoracic and abdominal aorta has evolved into an accepted alternative to open surgical repair for most adult aortic diseases . Complications of EVR include endoleaks, stent graft migration, and thrombus formation . Previous studies using computational fluid dynamics reported that those complications may be caused by three-dimensional (3D) hemodynamic changes after EVR .

It has been shown that increased pressure in a stent graft leads to an increased drag force on the stent graft that in turn may be followed by stent graft migration . Furthermore, a type III endoleak may occur in cases with high wall stress at the junction of two stent grafts . Finally, areas of reduced velocity within the stent graft might be associated with thrombus formation .

![Figure 1, Adjusted pump setting to mimic the aortic target waveform on the basis of a volunteer. The difference between the pump setting and the two-dimensional through-plane velocity-encoded cine magnetic resonance imaging measurement is due mostly to the tubing connecting the pump outlet with the elastic aortic tube. The additional late systolic peak is probably caused by a wave reflection within the phantom. Note that the shape of the flow waveform does not influence the average flow rate over the cycle and thus the values calculated in this study.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImpactofanAorticNitinolStentGraftonFlowMeasurementsbyTimeresolvedThreedimensionalVelocityencodedMRI/0_1s20S1076633211005125.jpg)
