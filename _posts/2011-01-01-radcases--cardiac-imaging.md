This is the first edition of a dedicated cardiac imaging case series published by Thieme. Few competing texts are available in this area and the addition of this book is welcome. This is a collaborative effort between Dr. Restrepo (Texas Health Science Center) and Dr. Bardo (Oregon Health and Science University). The book is part of a series of case review books being developed by Thieme.

The text is separated into sections containing Cases, Further Reading, and Index. The Cases section is 200 pages, containing 100 cardiovascular cases, 70% computed tomography, 25% magnetic resonance, and 5% mixed. Most cases represent adult disease. Cardiac and vascular cases are equally represented. The cases are not organized and do not appear to increase in difficulty.

Each case is two pages. They are first presented as a group of two to five images with “clinical presentation” listed below. On the back of the page, the same images are reprinted but with annotation and figure legends explaining the imaging findings. Below this are four additional sections containing bulleted text: differential diagnosis, essential facts, other imaging findings, and pearls and pitfalls.

_Differential diagnosis_ will generally list three diagnoses, each with a short description. The correct diagnosis is in bold. _Essential facts_ contains high-yield clinical facts about the correct diagnosis. _Other imaging findings_ will list imaging findings not demonstrated on the current case, findings seen in other presentations or other modalities. The _Pearls and pitfalls_ section often overlaps with the former two sections. However, this section will contain information about staging, workup, or clinical information that can exclude/include a diagnosis.

The _Further reading_ section contains references pertinent to each case. Cases are relisted by number with the corresponding diagnosis. Most cases include three references, composed mostly of journal articles. The _Index_ section is well organized.

Image quality of the cases is very good and clearly demonstrates the pathology. The content of the four sections described previously is equally good. The information presented is relevant. Although the text is bulleted throughout, it is clearly written. The overall construction of the book is very good with high-quality paper and binding.
