## Rationale and Objectives

Workflow efficiency and workload of radiological technologists (RTs) were compared in head examinations performed with two 1.5 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanners equipped with or without an automated user interface called “day optimizing throughput” (Dot) workflow engine.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-four patients with known intracranial pathology were examined with a 1.5 T MR scanner with Dot workflow engine (Siemens MAGNETOM Aera) and with a 1.5 T MR scanner with conventional user interface (Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto) using four standardized examination protocols. The elapsed time for all necessary work steps, which were performed by 11 RTs within the total examination time, was compared for each examination at both MR scanners. The RTs evaluated the user-friendliness of both scanners by a questionnaire. Normality of distribution was checked for all continuous variables by use of the Shapiro-Wilk test. Normally distributed variables were analyzed by Student's paired _t_ -test, otherwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare means.

## Results

Total examination time of MR examinations performed with Dot engine was reduced from 24:53 to 20:01 minutes ( _P_ < .001) and the necessary RT intervention decreased by 61% ( _P_ < .001). The Dot engine's automated choice of MR protocols was significantly better assessed by the RTs than the conventional user interface ( _P_ = .001).

## Conclusions

According to this preliminary study, the Dot workflow engine is a time-saving user assistance software, which decreases the RTs’ effort significantly and may help to automate neuroradiological examinations for a higher workflow efficiency.

In the past, complete digitalization of radiology departments using a combination of a radiology information system (RIS) and picture archiving and communication system (PACS) has been shown to be time-saving at nearly all steps of the workflow . To further optimize productivity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) units within departments of diagnostic radiology, increasing attention is being placed on workflow automation. Workflow is the process of analyzing the individual steps that occur during performance of MRI exams . The actual scan time of 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanners cannot significantly be decreased without a reduction of image quality. However, the automation of magnetic resonance (MR) examinations by simplified user interfaces may be the key to increase time efficiency of MRI units, for instance by reducing dead time between individual scanning steps.

“Day optimizing throughput” (Dot) workflow engines are automated user interfaces of the new 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanners by Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany (eg, MAGNETOM Aera). This user assistance software offers a customizable framework for automated MR examinations of different body regions (eg, brain, abdomen, heart, vessels). This study deals with the brain Dot engine that should simplify the workflow of standardized head examinations by the integration of patient information, step-by-step user guidance, and a choice of predefined exam strategies (  Fig 1 ) in comparison to commonly used MR software (  Fig 2 ). All Dot engines offer three overviews named “parameter view,” which displays commonly used MR protocol parameters for adjustment; “patient view,” which provides exam-relevant patient information; and “guidance view,” which offers image examples and reference texts for user guidance (  Fig 3 ). Patient data and positioning information are provided at the scanner for fast patient setup, and if necessary voice commands are integrated into the scan process to ensure synchronization of breathholds and scanning.

The Dot workflow engine of MAGNETOM Aera offers semiautomated bolus timing for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). After acquisition of test bolus images, the radiological technologist has to mark one carotid artery **(a)** and one jugular vein manually. In addition, the preselected field of view has to be confirmed with a mouse click (not shown). The optimal delay for the injection of contrast media is calculated with help of the arterial and venous bolus curves. The delay time is integrated automatically in the simplified parameter card **(b)** . Contrast injection and acquisition of MRA images are completed automatically.

**(a)** The conventional user interface of MAGNETOM Avanto requires more work steps to acquire a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Field of view, alignment, and number of slices have to be selected manually in the vessel scout images or in the parameter card, respectively. The carotid artery has to be marked to calculate the delay time with a separate software tool named “mean curve” **(b)** . Baseline and bolus peak of the bolus curve have to be selected and confirmed by several mouse clicks. The resulting delay time has to be filled in the parameter card manually. With further mouse clicks, contrast injection and acquisition of MRA images are started.

Guidance view is a software tool integrated in Dot engines, which optionally guides users with sample images and texts through the magnetic resonance (MR) examination. In this example, work steps are explained to acquire the test bolus for contrast-enhanced MR angiographies.
