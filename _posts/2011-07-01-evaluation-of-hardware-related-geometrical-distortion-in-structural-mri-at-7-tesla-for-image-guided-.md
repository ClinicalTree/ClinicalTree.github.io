## Rationale and Objectives

Geometrical distortion is a well-known problem in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), leading to pixel shifts with variations up to several millimeters. Because the main factors of geometrical distortion are proportional to B  0 , MRI spatial encoding distortions tend to increase with higher magnetic field strength. With the increasing prospects of utilizing ultra-high-field MRI (B  0 ≥ 7 Tesla) for neuroimaging and subsequently for image-guided neurosurgical therapy, the evaluation and correction of geometrical distortions occurring in ultra-high-field MRI are essential preconditions for the integration of these data. Hence, we conducted a phantom study to determine hardware-related geometrical distortion in clinically relevant sequences for structural imaging at 7 T MRI and compared the findings to 1.5 T MRI.

## Material and Methods

Hardware-related geometrical distortion was evaluated using a MRI phantom (Elekta, Sweden). Both applied scanner systems (Magnetom Avanto 1.5 T and Magnetom 7 T, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) were equipped with similar gradient coils capable of delivering 45 mT/m of maximum amplitude and a slew rate of 220 mT/m/ms. Distortion analysis was performed for various clinically relevant gradient echo and spin echo sequences.

## Results

Overall, we found very low mean geometrical distortions at both 7 T and 1.5 T, although single values of up to 1.6 mm were detected. No major differences in mean distortion between the sequences could be found, except significantly higher distortions in turbo spin-echo sequences at 7 T, mainly caused by B  1 inhomogeneities.

## Conclusion

Hardware-related geometrical distortions at 7 T MRI are relatively small, which may be acceptable for image coregistration or for direct tissue-targeting procedures. Using a subject-specific correction of object-related distortions, an integration of 7 T MRI data into image-guided applications may be feasible.

The incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data into various neurosurgical procedures has become common clinical routine and is continuously expanding. This accounts in particular for their application in functional and stereotactic neurosurgery. Especially in regard to deep brain stimulation, the growing importance of MRI (eg, for structural targeting) has recently been emphasized . Another important field is image-guided radiosurgery .

Although the application of 3 Tesla (T) field-strength MRI in clinical routine is steadily increasing, higher field-strength systems, specifically 7 T scanners, are still primarily used for scientific or preclinical applications. First experiences from technical studies and single series of volunteers and patients show promising results for both structural and functional imaging . In particular, the delineation of deep brain structures using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) or T2∗-weighted imaging (eg, for deep brain stimulation procedures) has already been shown to be improved at 7 T field strength. The high-resolution structural depiction possible at higher field strengths within reasonable scan time may be valuable for neuronavigated surgery as well. Several exemplary images can be found in  Figures 1 and 2 .
