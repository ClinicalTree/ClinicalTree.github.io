## Rationale and Objectives

A histologic grade in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is clinically important because of its association with prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of histographic analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume in differentiating histologic grades in HNSCC at standard (b = 1000 s/mm  2 ) and high (b = 2000 s/mm  2 ) b values.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-four patients with HNSCC, including well-differentiated (WD; _n_ = 35), moderately differentiated (MD; _n_ = 13) and poorly differentiated (PD; _n_ = 6) carcinomas, were retrospectively evaluated. ADC maps were obtained at two different b values (1000 and 2000 s/mm  2 ) in each patient. Tumors were delineated on each slice of ADC maps, and data were collected to obtain a histogram for the entire tumor volume. Histographic parameters were calculated, including mean, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and the ratio of the kurtosis measured at b values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm  2 . These parameters were correlated with histologic grades.

## Results

There was no significant correlation between tumor grades and histographic parameters obtained from ADC maps at b = 1000 s/mm  2 . However, mean ADC at b = 2000 s/mm  2 was significantly higher in WD HNSCC (881 ± 131 × 10  −6 mm  2 /s) than in MD and PD HNSCC (770 ± 163 and 780 ± 158 × 10  −6 mm  2 /s, respectively) ( _P_ < .05). Kurtosis ratio was significantly higher in PD HNSCC (115 ± 10%) compared to WD and MD HNSCC (91 ± 21% and 86 ± 26%, respectively) ( _P_ < .05). Diagnostic accuracy was 100%, 76.9%, and 65.8% for PD, MD, and WD HNSCC, respectively.

## Conclusions

Histographic analysis of ADC maps on the basis of the entire tumor volume can be useful in differentiating histologic grades of HNSCC using mean ADC at b = 2000 s/mm  2 and kurtosis ratio.

Several clinicopathologic parameters are implicated in prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), including tumor size, stage of disease, primary site of the tumor, nodal involvement, tumor thickness, status of surgical margins and status of human papilloma virus infection, and histologic grade . Histologic grade is generally determined by subjective assessment of the degree of keratinization, cellular and nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic activity . Several studies have shown the association of histologic grade with prognosis . A multivariate analysis study by Larsen et al revealed that histologic grade was significantly related to nodal disease at the time of diagnosis. Jerjes et al reported that recurrence after surgery was associated with histologic grades, and about 90% of mortality due to locoregional spread or distant metastasis occurred in moderately differentiated (MD) or poorly differentiated (PD) carcinomas. In addition, Kademani et al reported histologic grade to have a significant effect on survival using a Kaplan-Meier model, showing 44% decrease in survival per grade. Therefore, the assessment of histologic grade prior to treatment may be of clinical importance.

Diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps provides a quantitative index of water diffusivity for each voxel, allowing visualization of molecular diffusion in tissue and providing indirect information on the microstructure of tissue . Many studies have demonstrated the value of ADC maps in pretreatment brain tumor grading, on the basis of the concept that the high cellularity of high-grade tumors results in greater diffusion restriction and lower ADCs . In the head and neck region, ADC maps have recently been introduced and applied to differentiate neck pathologies , characterize neck lymph nodes , monitor posttreatment response , assess tumor recurrence , and predict local failure .
