## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to determine which factors affected the decrease in average glandular dose recorded at the annual U.S. Food and Drug Administration Mammography Quality Standards Act inspections of mammography equipment in North Carolina from 2002 through 2005.

## Materials and Methods

Average glandular dose, half-value layer, kVp, equipment age, processing speed, and system speed for every mammography unit in the state were collected by Food and Drug Administration−trained state inspectors. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate the changes of glandular dose over time and to identify the factors associated with these changes.

## Results

There was a statistically significant decrease in average glandular dose in North Carolina since 2002. Factors that were statistically significantly associated with this effect were changes in kVp, equipment age, processing speed, and system speed.

## Conclusion

Average glandular dose for mammography has decreased in North Carolina after 2002. This change is probably at least partially due to the cumulative effect of direct intervention by mammography consultants and statewide educational seminars on mammography quality control.

Ionizing radiation has been shown to induce breast cancers in populations exposed to very large radiation doses ( ). These data have been extrapolated to estimate the risk of breast cancer in patients exposed to low doses ( ). Federal regulation of mammography has led to reduced radiation exposure in patients undergoing screening mammography ( ). Radiation exposure of the glandular elements of the breasts is reported as average glandular dose (AGD) ( ) and has been gradually increasing in the United States since the 1980s ( ). It was this observed trend in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection data that prompted Pisano et al. ( ) to evaluate and analyze the factors affecting increasing radiation dose for mammography in the state of North Carolina from 1997 to 2001.

In the study by Pisano et al., there was a statistically significant increase in the AGD in North Carolina mammography facilities in 1999, 2000, and 2001 compared with the baseline year of 1997. Factors that were statistically significantly related to this effect were changes in kVp, processing speed (PS), and system speed (SS) ( ). In order to reverse this trend, mammography consultant intervention and statewide educational seminars on mammography quality control were instituted. A trend toward decreasing dose for North Carolina mammography facilities from 2002 through 2005 was detected after the interventions. This article reports this trend and analyzes the decrease in AGD in North Carolina.
