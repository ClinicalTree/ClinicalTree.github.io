As stated in the title of this book, this text is a collection of interesting musculoskeletal cases gathered by the authors, who are participants in a weekly web-based teleconference. This collaborative effort succeeds in its goals to show a variety of interesting topics of musculoskeletal imaging and to better educate the reader.

Because the book is available only via an e-version, many will be greatly pleased by its digital presentation. Far too often it can be a struggle to find the relevant findings in the images of radiologic textbooks. This may be due to the images being too small, having poor contrast, or containing print imperfections. Because radiology is an image-based specialty, perhaps the most important aspect to a radiologic case-based textbook is the images. Luckily, readers will not be disappointed in this textbook. The image quality is superb. The image selection is also quite good in that readers can easily see the findings and attempt to appropriately interpret the images. Additionally, its digital presentation allows for magnification and contrast adjustment.

Another benefit of this e-version is that this format lends itself to easily searching for topics throughout the textbook. The reader can easily transport the book on his or her laptop, tablet, or other e-reader. This book can then serve as a quick reference for the reader throughout the work day.

As the book is based on the weekly web conference conducted by numerous participants, various topics are addressed. This book may not be for the individual who is searching for an in-depth discussion on one general category of musculoskeletal imaging, such as inflammatory arthritis. However, each individual case is well-written and given an appropriate amount of attention such that the reader has a greater grasp of the more basic entities, such as joint arthroplasties, and the rare, such as uncommon soft-tissue tumors.

There are occasional awkward moments with this textbook because the captions for each respective image are on the subsequent page, which can be somewhat confusing when similar images are presented. The reader may easily forget that the text on the same page for an image is discussing findings from the prior page, not the current one. Thankfully, this is one of the few missteps in this book.

Only two groups may be disappointed in this textbook. The first are those who seek having a tangible textbook. The second are those who finish this book and say “more please,” because this book contains only 50 cases.
