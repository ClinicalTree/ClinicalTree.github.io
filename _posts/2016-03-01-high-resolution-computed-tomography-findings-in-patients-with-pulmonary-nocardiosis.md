## Rationale and Objectives

Nocardiosis is difficult to diagnose, and the diagnosis is thus frequently delayed. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis have been documented in few reports. Our study objective was to assess HRCT findings of patients with pulmonary nocardiosis.

## Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective study of 20 consecutive patients with pulmonary _Nocardia_ infections who underwent HRCT of the chest at our institutions from January 2011 to August 2014. After the exclusion of two patients with concurrent infections, the study group comprised 18 patients (11 men, 7 women; age range, 39–83 years; mean, 67.9 years) with pulmonary _Nocardia_ infections. Parenchymal abnormalities, enlarged lymph nodes, and pleural effusion were evaluated on HRCT.

## Results

Underlying conditions included respiratory disease ( _n_ = 6, 33.3%), collagen diseases ( _n_ = 5, 27.8%), and diabetes mellitus ( _n_ = 4, 22.2%). All patients showed abnormal HRCT findings, including the presence of a nodule/mass ( _n_ = 17, 94.4%), ground-glass opacity ( _n_ = 14, 77.8%), interlobular septal thickening ( _n_ = 14, 77.8%), and cavitation ( _n_ = 12, 66.7%). Pleural effusion was seen in two patients. There were no cases of lymph node enlargement.

## Conclusions

Among the HRCT findings in patients with pneumonia, a nodule/mass with interlobular septal thickening and/or cavitation are suggestive of pulmonary nocardiosis.

## Introduction

_Nocardia_ are a group of aerobic, Gram-positive, partially acid-fast species that are ubiquitous in the environment as saprophytic components in dust, soil, water, decaying vegetation, and stagnant matter. They are not part of the normal human flora nor are they a common laboratory contaminant . Human infection mainly occurs through direct inoculation of the skin or by inhalation.

People susceptible to _Nocardia_ infections include recipients of lung, heart, bone marrow, and kidney transplants; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals; chronic steroid users; and patients with malignancies . However, as many as one-third of patients with nocardiosis have normal immunity . Clinically, pulmonary nocardiosis presents as pneumonia with nonspecific symptoms such as productive cough, fever, dyspnea, chills, weight loss, fatigue, and hemoptysis, with symptoms developing over a period of weeks to months . There are no suggestive clinical manifestations, and nocardiosis is difficult to diagnose .
