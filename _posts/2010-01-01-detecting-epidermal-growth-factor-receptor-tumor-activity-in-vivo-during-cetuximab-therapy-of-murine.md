## Rationale and Objectives

Noninvasive molecular imaging of glioma tumor receptor activity was assessed with diagnostic in vivo fluorescence monitoring during targeted therapy. The study goals were to assess the range of use for treatment monitoring and stratification of tumor types using epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) status with administration of fluorescently labeled EGF and determine its utility for tumor detection compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

EGFR+ and EGFR− glioma tumor lines (human glioma \[U251-GFP\] and rat gliosarcoma \[9L-GFP\], respectively) were used to assess these goals, having a 20-fold difference between their EGF uptakes.

## Results

Treatment with cetuximab in the EGFR+ tumor-bearing animals led to decreased EGF tumor uptake, whereas for the EGFR− tumors, no change in fluorescence signal followed treatment. This diagnostic difference in EGFR expression could be used to stratify the tumor-bearing animals into groups of potential responders and nonresponders, and receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 in separating these tumors. The nonlocalized growth pattern of U251-GFP tumors resulted in detection difficulty on standard MRI, but high EGFR expression made them detectable by fluorescence imaging (AUC = 1.0). The EGFR+ U251-GFP tumor–bearing animals could be noninvasively stratified into treated and untreated groups on the basis of fluorescence intensity difference ( _P_ = .035, AUC = 0.90).

## Conclusions

EGFR expression was tracked in vivo with fluorescence and determined to be of use for the stratification of EGFR+ and EGFR− tumors, the detection of EGFR+ tumors, and monitoring of molecular therapy.

Although malignant gliomas account for a small percentage of cancers diagnosed, they have proved to be some of the least responsive to aggressive therapies, including surgical resection, radiation therapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy . As a result, average patient survival from the date of diagnosis is in the range of 9 to 12 months , and morbidity rates approach 100%. Given the poor performance of conventional therapies, new treatment approaches are necessary. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has a defined set of “molecular lesions” as well as identified disruptions in signaling pathways and therefore may respond more readily to newly developed targeted therapies . One such target is epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed in 40% to 50% of all GBMs . Overexpression of EGFR appears to be correlated with glioma grade, and an unfavorable prognostic relationship has been shown between EGFR amplification and overall survival of patients with GBM . Part of the difficulty in the development and testing of targeted therapies is the need to track biomarkers and surrogate measures of response to therapy in individual subjects. In particular, molecular expression is known to increase or decrease significantly in response to therapy, and the ability to track expression during courses of therapy may become critically important. In this study, a novel optical method was considered to monitor targeted therapy diagnostically in vivo.

Overexpression of EGFR in GBM as well as many other types of cancer has been shown to promote the development and progression of malignancy given its association with cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and apoptosis inhibition . Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies target the extracellular domain of the receptor and have been shown to successfully block its activation . The IMC-C225, or cetuximab, antibody has been commercially developed by ImClone Systems Inc., (New York, NY) and is in clinical trials for several cancer types. Clinical trials for GBMs are still in their preliminary stages, although preclinical data suggested that systemic cetuximab treatment decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in xenograft models of GBM grown both subcutaneously and orthotopically, when the cell line overexpressed EGFR . The ability to noninvasively track monoclonal antibody binding, tumor response, and EGFR expression in situ would have considerable value if it could be performed reliably with high sensitivity. Tumor tissue changes at the molecular level occur prior to any detectable tumor size changes, so the ability to dynamically and quantitatively assess and track the molecular profile in vivo could provide substantial patient benefit. Additionally, there is evidence to support the fact that signaling pathways change in response to receptor blocking therapy , so having the ability to track dynamic changes could significantly improve the potential of developing multireceptor targeting approaches.
