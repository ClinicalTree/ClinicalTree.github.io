## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the relationship between heightened levels of reader performance and reader practice in terms of number of cases read and previous experience.

## Materials and Methods

A test set of mammograms was developed comprising 50 cases. These cases consisted of 15 abnormals (biopsy proven) and 35 normals (confirmed at subsequent rescreen). Sixty-nine breast image readers reviewed these cases independently and their performance was measured by recording their individual receiver operating characteristic score (area under the curve), sensitivity, and specificity. These measures of performance were then compared to a range of factors relating to the reader such as years of certification and reporting, number of cases read per year, previous experiences, and satisfaction levels. Correlation analyses using Spearman methods were performed along with the Mann-Whitney test to detect differences in performance between specific reader groups.

## Results

Improved reader performance was found for years certified ( _P_ = .004), years of experience ( _P_ = .0001), and hours reading per week ( _P_ = .003) shown by positive statistical significant relationships with Az values (area under receiver operating characteristic curve). Statistical comparisons of Az values scored for individuals who read varying number of cases per year showed that those individuals whose annual mammographic case load was 5000 or more ( _P_ = .03) or between 2000 and 4999 ( _P_ = .05), had statistically significantly higher scores than those who read less than 1000 cases per year.

## Conclusion

The results of this study have shown variations in reader performance relating to parameters of reader practice and experience. Levels of variance are shown and potential acceptance levels for diagnostic efficacy are proposed which may inform policy makers, judicial systems and public debate.

Breast cancer is a global problem with 1 in 11 women in Australia, and 1 in 9 women in the United States and the United Kingdom being diagnosed with this disease during their lifetime . It is the second most common cancer, with half a million new cases worldwide each year , and is the most common cause of cancer death amongst females in Australia . Mammography is still the most common diagnostic procedure both for symptomatic patients and screening participants, particularly for those older than 50 years old who make up approximately 80% of breast cancer cases . Although image perception research is now considered crucially important to promote diagnostic efficacy and much work has been done to explore the impact of technical features, such as acquisition devices, displays, and environmental conditions on lesion detection, relatively less work has focused on the relationship between diagnostic performance and expert reader practice and experience. Also, the variability that may exist between expert readers and the possibility of establishing “acceptable” levels of diagnostic efficacy from a large group of experts reading a test set of clinically relevant breast images remains underexplored.

A recent questionnaire-based study involving 83 mammography readers employed by BreastScreen Services in Australia demonstrated the heterogeneity of mammographic screen readers ; age varied between 26 and >56 years; years of experience reporting mammograms ranged from <1 year to >10 years; some radiologists only reported breast images, whereas others reported a variety of different image types; individual reporting sessions ranged from <1 hour to up to and including 5 hours; numbers of cases read per year ranged from between 501 and 1000 to >10,000. Although this previous work demonstrated the variability that exists within reader practice and considers the impact this may have on levels of concentration, no attempt was made to explore if correlations exist between reader practice or experience and reader performance in terms of receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity or specificity scores.
