## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to determine (1) whether United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores predict academic productivity in neuroradiology fellows as measured by publications and citations, and (2) what factors predict such productivity.

## Materials and Methods

We reviewed the USMLE scores, gender, medical school location attended, publication record before and during fellowship, fellowship evaluation ratings and subsequent practice site (private vs academic) of neuroradiology fellows from 2004 to 2014 to determine relationships with publications and citations after fellowship. Spearman's correlation and Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess the association between these factors and quantity of publications and citations per year after fellowship.

## Results

USMLE scores and fellowship evaluation scores correlated inversely with radiology publications and citations. There were strong correlations between publication records before or during fellowship and after fellowship. Fellows from international medical schools, with PhD degrees, and those fellows proceeding to academic practice had more publications before or during and after neuroradiology fellowship.

## Conclusions

The best predictors of whether a graduating neuroradiology fellow will publish and have high citation rates is prior publication record, a PhD degree, and staying in academics. USMLE scores and evaluations during the fellowship were inversely correlated with publication measures of academic productivity.

## Introduction

Components of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) are taken at various stages in a medical trainee's career and are one way that residency and fellowship applicants, in most medical specialties, are evaluated and ranked . Step 1 of the test is essentially a general medical knowledge test and is usually taken after the second year of medical school for American students. International graduate students applying to American training programs typically take Step 1 as the first part of the USMLE, but it can also be taken years after their medical school training. American students usually take the two components of Step 2 of the USMLE, Clinical Knowledge and Clinical Skills, in their final year of medical school. Most Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) residency programs require passing Steps 1 and 2 before acceptance. However, Step 3, a test of patient management and decision-making, can be taken during internship or residency, although it is usually completed before the end of postgraduate training. All of the Steps are offered to international medical graduates at any time during their medical career.

A previous publication reported that the USMLE Steps 1 and 2 were correlated with core competency evaluations of neuroradiology fellows . It was concluded that there is justification for using USMLE scores as part of the screening or acceptance criteria for evaluating neuroradiology fellowship candidates. However, the criteria for judging a successful graduate of a neuroradiology fellowship program may extend beyond the fellowship itself. Passing the neuroradiology subspecialty boards after fellowship is not considered a good marker for career success because the pass rate is so high. Subspecialty certification scores are unlikely to tease out the relationship between “success” and USMLE scores because the examination scores are no longer provided to fellowship programs with a numerical value, just pass or fail.
