In this issue, _Academic Radiology_ is presenting a number of articles reviewing different aspects of medical informatics . These articles collect the information provided in the Association of University Radiologists (AUR)-Carestream Innovations in Academic Radiology course given during the 2011 AUR meeting held in Boston, MA.

Since 2009, the AUR has partnered with Carestream Health to sponsor a yearly course centered on innovative aspects of academic radiology. The maiden course was entitled, “Cutting Edge in Optical Imaging” and was moderated by David J. Hill, PhD, and Robert F. Mattrey, MD; in 2010, the topic was “Quality and Safety in Academic Radiology” moderated by Kimberly E. Applegate, MD. The 2011 course focused on “Enterprise-Wide and Multisite Imaging and Archiving” and the course moderator was Keith J. Dreyer, DO. We are thankful for the support and vision of Carestream Health as a key industry partner of the AUR, promoting and training in the key innovations in our specialty and how they affect academic radiology departments.

_Academic Radiology_ provides the ideal vehicle to have in print the valuable teaching that was provided to the attendees of the 2011 AUR-Carestream course. In this issue, _Academic Radiology_ readership has the opportunity to enjoy a primer on imaging informatics that focuses on academic radiology departments. This area of knowledge is certainly becoming a key element of our technology based specialty. Any practicing radiologist is aware of the many benefits of imaging informatics including increase in 1) our efficiency via picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), voice recognition (VC), radiology information systems (RIS), and structured reporting; 2) our flexibility such as distance reading, virtual networks, utility grid-like transfer of studies, and so on; and 3) our quality such as automatic communication of unexpected results and repository of errors. Imaging informatics provides, in addition, extraordinary educational possibilities ranging from simulation exercises , PACS-based tutorials , on-call preparation , electronic case presentation , anatomy teaching , and countless other applications of benefit to our trainees and students. Our trainees have at their fingertips images, articles, and all sorts of information via the Internet that was just a dream barely a generation ago.

In research, imaging informatics provides, among other features, research PACS and tools to perform informatics-based research such as in comparative effectiveness where large databases are required . Large collaborative databases are appearing across the world with important resources in many specialties. As expected, radiology is at the forefront . The use of cloud computing is obviously another new avenue that will, in the immediate future, open possibilities for researchers in medicine in general and in particular in the radiological sciences .

The faculty of the AUR-Carestream course in 2011 offered its teaching in three major areas of knowledge in imaging informatics. Dr. Sunshine from Case Western Reserve University presented the benefits of PACS in a large health care system in which academic and community practices are intertwined allowing subspecialty readings in community hospitals some designated of critical access in rural areas. Conversely, community hospital–based material becomes available to the academic medical center for training and research purposes. Mansoori et al walk the _Academic Radiology_ readership from the basic evolution of PACS, integration between PACS and RIS, lessons learned in the preparation for implementation as well as the implementation itself. They continue with the practical application of PACS to a large integrated health care system, including financial implications and future horizons .

The presentation of Dr. Avrin was on the planning and business justification of enterprise imaging. His article discusses the many financial advantages of having an innovative PACS regarding increased efficiencies and better delivery of care with imaging informatics enhanced communications with clinicians and includes a summary on how to plan business justifications in a capital intensive subspecialty such as radiology .
