## Rationale and Objectives

Acoustic noise both in terms of its magnitude and frequency during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is influenced by imaging parameters and pulse sequences. It varies because of many different factors such as structure, materials, and magnetic field strength. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the characteristics of acoustic noise independent of MRI scan protocol by measuring a gradient-pulse-to-acoustic-noise transfer function (GPAN-TF) at various MRI scanners.

## Materials and Methods

We measured sound pressure levels in the frequency domain in a 0.4-T, seven 1.5-T, and three 3.0-T clinical MRI systems when applying a simple narrower trapezoidal gradient pulse. We calculated a GPAN-TF \[μPa/(mT/m)\] in each gradient coil (ie, X, Y, and Z-axis) by the deconvolution process.

## Results

GPAN-TF at a high-frequency range (1000–10,000 Hz) was larger than that at low frequency for all MRI ( _P_ <0.01) scanners except for a low static field machine. For high frequency (>1000 Hz), the 3.0-T MRI scanner had a larger GPAN-TF than that of 0.4-T and 1.5-T ( _P_ < .01). MR scanner with a vacuum chamber reduced GPAN-TF at a lower frequency ( _P_ < .01), but this effect decreased at higher frequency.

## Conclusion

GPAN-TF analysis makes it possible to obtain more detailed information on acoustic noise properties among MRI scanners.

Acoustic noise during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is primarily caused by Lorenz forces induced in the scanner as electric currents are switched in the gradient coils within the static magnetic field. The noise can not only cause anxiety, stress, and annoyance, but temporary or permanent shift in the threshold of hearing as well . There are also studies that this sound affects the results of functional MRI . In addition, the noise interferes with verbal communication and pediatric imaging.

In recent years, various acoustic noise control systems have been developed and put into practice . For example, the gradient coil is positioned inside a vacuum chamber to reduce the acoustic noise . On the other hand, fast imaging techniques have a higher dB/dt, and MRI scanners with a high static magnetic field have proliferated. Therefore, acoustic noise during MRI has become a greater concern in clinical practice .

where _H_ ( _f_ ) is the frequency response function (ie, GPAN-TF), which is not dependent on the input and represents acoustic noise transfer property of the system. _AN_ ( _f_ ) is the gradient-induced acoustic noise measured by ISLM as previously mentioned. On the other hand, we assumed that the input pulse is approximately a simple narrow trapezoidal waveform as shown in  Figure 2 , then we obtain the Fourier transform of the gradient pulse, that is _GP_ ( _f_ ). Thus, we calculated the GPAN-TF (= _AN_ ( _f_ )/ _GP_ ( _f_ )), then compared among the MRI scanners as follows (  Table 1 ).
