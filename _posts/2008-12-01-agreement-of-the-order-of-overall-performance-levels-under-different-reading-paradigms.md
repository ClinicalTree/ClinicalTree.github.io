## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate consistency of the orders of performance levels when interpreting mammograms under three different reading paradigms.

## Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective observer study in which nine experienced radiologists rated an enriched set of mammography examinations that they personally had read in the clinic (“individualized”) mixed with a set that none of them had read in the clinic (“common set”). Examinations were interpreted under three different reading paradigms: binary using screening Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), and free-response ROC (FROC). The performance in discriminating between cancer and noncancer findings under each of the paradigms was summarized using Youden's index/2+0.5 (Binary), nonparameteric area under the ROC curve (AUC), and an overall FROC index (JAFROC-2). Pearson correlation coefficients were then computed to assess consistency in the ordering of observers' performance levels. Statistical significance of the computed correlation coefficients was assessed using bootstrap confidence intervals obtained by resampling sets of examination-specific observations.

## Results

All but one of the computed pair-wise correlation coefficients were larger than 0.66 and were significantly different from zero. The correlation between the overall performance measures under the Binary and ROC paradigms was the lowest (0.43) and was not significantly different from zero (95% confidence interval −0.078 to 0.733).

## Conclusion

The use of different evaluation paradigms in the laboratory tends to lead to consistent ordering of the overall performance levels of observers. However, one should recognize that conceptually similar performance indexes resulting from different paradigms often measure different performance characteristics and thus disagreements are not only possible but frequently quite natural.

Considerable progress has been made in the last two decades with regard to our understanding of the methodologies needed for the analysis of retrospective observer performance studies ( ). Perhaps the simplest type of performance study is a binary detection task (binary response) that primarily provides performance measures in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Another frequently used approach is a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) paradigm that provides information on how sensitivity and specificity change with varying decision thresholds for multicategory (discrete or semi-continuous) type ratings ( ). Another approach that has been recently gaining acceptance is the free-response ROC (FROC) paradigm, which uses a “locate then rate” approach with an a priori unknown number of suspected locations per image or examination ( ). The primary purpose of a specific study should determine which of the approaches is optimal in terms of validity, appropriateness, and clinical relevance ( ). Unfortunately, specific paradigms are frequently selected based on prior experience and/or expertise of the investigators, available resources, and prior studies performed to address the same or similar hypotheses.

Because the three paradigms can often be implemented in the same situation, an important question of interest is whether or not the results of a study performed under one paradigm (eg, ROC) are likely to remain had the study been performed under another paradigm (eg, FROC). Different observers may behave substantially differently under different paradigms, and there are virtually no data to support the consistency of radiologists' performance levels when interpreting examinations under these different paradigms. It is a well known and studied phenomenon that radiologists' interpretations vary substantially, leading to significant intra- and interobserver variabilities in general ( ) and during screening mammography interpretations in particular ( ). Thus, it is important to investigate whether the widely varying performance levels of readers under different paradigms correlate with each other.
