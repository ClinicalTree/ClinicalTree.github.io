## Rationale and Objectives

Diaphragmatic motion in a standing position during tidal breathing remains unclear. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate diaphragmatic motion during tidal breathing in a standing position in a health screening center cohort using dynamic chest radiography in association with participants' demographic characteristics.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred seventy-two subjects (103 men; aged 56.3 ± 9.8 years) underwent sequential chest radiographs during tidal breathing using dynamic chest radiography with a flat panel detector system. We evaluated the excursions of and peak motion speeds of the diaphragms. Associations between the excursions and participants' demographics (gender, height, weight, body mass index \[BMI\], smoking history, tidal volume, vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume) were investigated.

## Results

The average excursion of the left diaphragm (14.9 ± 4.6 mm, 95% CI 14.2–15.5 mm) was significantly larger than that of the right (11.0 ± 4.0 mm, 95% CI 10.4–11.6 mm) ( _P_ < 0.001). The peak motion speed of the left diaphragm (inspiratory, 16.6 ± 4.2 mm/s; expiratory, 13.7 ± 4.2 mm/s) was significantly faster than that of the right (inspiratory, 12.4 ± 4.4 mm/s; expiratory, 9.4 ± 3.8 mm/s) (both _P_ < 0.001). Both simple and multiple regression models demonstrated that higher BMI and higher tidal volume were associated with increased excursions of the bilateral diaphragm (all _P_ < 0.05).

## Conclusions

The average excursions of the diaphragms are 11.0 mm (right) and 14.9 mm (left) during tidal breathing in a standing position. The diaphragmatic motion of the left is significantly larger and faster than that of the right. Higher BMI and tidal volume are associated with increased excursions of the bilateral diaphragm.

## Introduction

The bilateral diaphragm is the most important respiratory muscle. Diaphragmatic dysfunction is an underappreciated cause of respiratory difficulties and may be due to a wide variety of issues, including surgery, trauma, tumor, and infection . Several previous studies have evaluated diaphragmatic motion using fluoroscopy , ultrasound , magnetic resonance (MR) fluoroscopy (dynamic MR imaging \[MRI\]) , and computed tomography (CT) . However, the data of the previous studies using ultrasound, MR fluoroscopy, or CT were obtained in a supine position , not in a standing position. Also, while the data of the previous studies using fluoroscopy were obtained in a standing position, the data were assessed under forced breathing , not under tidal or resting breathing. Thus, diaphragmatic motion in a standing position during tidal breathing remains unclear, even though it is essential for understanding respiratory physiology in our daily life. Furthermore, the evaluation of diaphragmatic motion using fluoroscopy, ultrasound, dynamic MRI, or CT has not been used as a routine examination because of limitations, including high radiation dose, small field of view, low temporal resolution, and/or high cost.

Recently, dynamic chest radiography using a flat panel detector (FPD) system with a large field of view was introduced for clinical use. This technique can provide sequential chest radiographs with high temporal resolution during respiration , and the radiation dose is much lower than that of CT. Also, whereas CT and MRI are performed in the supine or prone position, dynamic chest radiology can be performed in a standing or sitting position, which is physiologically relevant. To the best of our knowledge, no detailed study has analyzed diaphragmatic motion during tidal breathing by using dynamic chest radiography.

(c) Graph showing the vertical excursions and the peak motion speeds of the bilateral diaphragm. A board-certified radiologist placed a point of interest (red point) on the highest point of each diaphragm on the radiograph at the resting end-expiratory position ( a ). These points were automatically traced by the template-matching technique throughout the respiratory phase (double arrows in b ) ( Supplementary Video S1 ); red double arrow indicates the vertical excursion of the right diaphragm and blue double arrow indicates that of the left diaphragm. Based on locations of the points on sequential radiographs, the vertical excursions and the peak motion speeds of the bilateral diaphragm were calculated (c) . The lowest point (0 mm) of the excursion on the graph indicated that the highest point of each diaphragm was at the resting end-expiratory position (ie, null point was set at the end-expiratory phase) ( c ).
