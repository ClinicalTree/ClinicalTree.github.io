## Rationale and Objectives

To estimate and statistically compare the bias and variance of radiologists measuring the size of spherical and complex synthetic nodules.

## Materials and Methods

This study did not require the institutional review board approval. Six radiologists estimated the size of 10 synthetic nodules embedded within an anthropomorphic thorax phantom from computed tomography scans at 0.8- and 5-mm slice thicknesses. The readers measured the nodule size using unidimensional (1D) longest in-slice dimension, bidimensional (2D) area from longest in-slice and longest perpendicular dimension, and three-dimensional (3D) semiautomated volume. Intercomparisons of bias (difference between average and true size) and variance among methods were performed after converting the 2D and 3D estimates to a compatible 1D scale.

## Results

The relative biases of radiologists with the 3D tool were −1.8%, −0.4%, −0.7%, −0.4%, and −1.6% for 10-mm spherical, 20-mm spherical, 20-mm elliptical, 10-mm lobulated, and 10-mm spiculated nodules compared to 1.4%, −0.1%, −26.5%, −7.8%, and −39.8% for 1D. The three-dimensional measurements were significantly less biased than 1D for elliptical, lobulated, and spiculated nodules. The relative standard deviations for 3D were 7.5%, 3.9%, 3.6%, 9.7%, and 8.3% compared to 5.7%, 2.6%, 20.3%, 5.3%, and 16.4% for 1D. Unidimensional sizing was significantly less variable than 3D for the lobulated nodule and significantly more variable for the ellipsoid and spiculated nodules. Three-dimensional bias and variability were smaller for thin 0.8-mm slice data compared to thick 5.0-mm data.

## Conclusions

The study shows that radiologist-controlled 3D volumetric lesion sizing can not only achieve smaller bias but also achieve similar or smaller variability compared to 1D sizing, especially for complex lesion shapes.

Multi-detector computed tomography (CT) imaging is a critical clinical tool in lung cancer evaluation. The recently reported results from the National Lung Screening Trial of subjects at high risk for lung cancer indicated that low-dose CT screening reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to planar chest radiography screening . These results along with the results from the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program provide strong evidence that CT screening has potential as an effective tool for detecting early, more survivable lung cancers. CT imaging has also had an impact on the staging of lung cancers and is one of the factors that led to the updated guidelines on the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors stage groupings in 2009 . Likewise, CT imaging has become a critically important tool for monitoring lung cancer patients undergoing therapy.

The response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) is currently the quantitative standard used to assess disease progression in patients with lung cancer in clinical trials . Although it was originally developed for use only in clinical trials, clinicians routinely ask radiologists to provide RECIST measurements as an objective evaluation of patient response in daily practice . The measurement standard for tumor sizing used as part of RECIST is the longest, in-plane diameter of a tumor. This measurement standard, although simple to implement, is also problematic for complex cancers because tumors do not generally expand or contract uniformly . In an effort to address the limitations of RECIST and to potentially improve the sensitivity of the measurement to true anatomical changes, volumetric sizing has been proposed as an alternative quantitative approach for measuring anatomical changes in a lesion over time. However, questions have been raised as to whether volumetric analysis will add value or only increase the costs of patient care and the complexity of running clinical trials .
