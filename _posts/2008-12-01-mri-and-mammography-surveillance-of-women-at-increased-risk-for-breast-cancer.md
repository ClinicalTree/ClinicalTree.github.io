## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate breast cancer screening with mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in high-risk populations, including women with the BRCA mutation, using an evidence-based approach.

## Methods

The MEDLINE, PubMed, EBM Reviews, ACP Journal Club, Cochrane Database MEDSEARCH, and SCOPUS databases were accessed and searched for articles up to August 2007. Articles were collected using the following terms and medical subject headings (MeSH) that applied to the focused clinical question: “BRCA1” and “BRCA2” with “mammography,” “MRI,” “prevention,” “screening,” and “surveillance.” References from retrieved articles were also used to identify relevant papers. Abstracts were screened and relevant papers retrieved. Retrieved papers were graded for quality. Summary performance measures were obtained by random effects modeling of study-specific performance estimates and standard errors derived from the multiple 2 × 2 tables. Additionally, studies meeting the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine level 2b quality were reviewed.

## Results

In women with an increased risk without the BRCA gene, cancer detection rates by MRI were 0.011 (95% confidence interval \[CI\] 0.003–0.019), by mammography 0.005 (95% CI 0.002–0.008), and by a combination of both, 0.012 (95% CI 0.004–0.020). False-positive rates by MRI, mammography, or a combination of both were 0.10 (95% CI 0.03–0.18), 0.05 (95% CI 0.03–0.06), and 0.14 (95% CI 0.04–0.24). In BRCA positive women, cancer detection rates by MRI were 0.027 (95% CI 0.015–0.040), by mammography 0.010 (95% CI 0.005–0.016), and by a combination of both 0.031 (95% CI 0.018–0.045). False-positive rates by MRI, mammography, or a combination of both were 0.10 (95% CI 0.01–0.19), 0.05 (95% CI 0.03–0.07), and 0.14 (95% CI 0.04–0.24), respectively.

## Conclusions

The data support an essential role for screening MRI in women with an increased risk for breast cancer.

The most recent American Cancer Society guidelines for breast cancer screening recommend magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance for women with a 20%–25% or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer ( ). These guidelines do not risk stratify their recommendations based on whether women are BRCA1 or BRCA2 (hereafter collectively referred to as BRCA 1/2) mutational carriers. We used an evidence-based approach to examine the evidence for breast cancer screening with mammography and MRI in the high-risk population, including women carrying the BRCA 1/2 mutation. The evidence-based practice question format Patient, Investigation, Comparison, and Outcomes of interest (PICO) ( ) was used to construct the following focused clinical question: In asymptomatic women at increased risk of breast cancer (BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers or strong family histories), how does MRI compare to mammography and the combination of MRI plus mammography in the detection of benign versus malignant lesions?

## Materials and methods
