## Rationale and Objectives

The objectives of this study were to investigate the changes in compartment-specific subchondral bone marrow lipids of femoral–tibial bone in acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)-injured patients compared to that of healthy volunteers and patients with osteoarthritis (OA) (Kellgren–Lawrence \[KL\] grade 2–3).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 55 subjects were recruited in the study and subdivided into three subgroups: 17 healthy controls (4 females, 13 males; mean age = 41 ± 16, age range 24–78 years), 17 patients with acute ACL injury (3 females, 14 males; mean age = 30 ± 11, age range 18–61 years), and 21 patients with KL2–3 OA (12 females, 9 males; mean age = 65 ± 12, age range 44–89 years). Routine clinical proton density–weighted fast spin echo images in sagittal (without fat saturation), axial, and coronal (fat saturation) planes were acquired on a 3 T clinical scanner for cartilage morphology using Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score grading. A voxel of 10 × 10 × 10 mm  3 was positioned in the medial and lateral compartments of the tibia and femur for proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements using the single voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode pulse sequence. All proton magnetic resonance data were processed with Java-based magnetic resonance user interface. Wilcoxon rank sum test and mixed model two-way analysis of variance were performed to determine significant differences between different compartments and examine the effect of ACL injury, OA grade and compartment, and their interactions.

## Results

The index of unsaturation in lateral tibial compartment in ACL-injured patients was significantly higher ( _P_ < .05) than all compartments except lateral femoral in patients with KL2–3 OA. Significantly lower values ( _P_ < .05) were also identified in saturated lipids at 2.03 ppm in all compartments in ACL-injured patients than those of all compartments in patients with KL2–3 OA.

## Conclusions

The preliminary results suggest that the indices of unsaturation in the lateral tibial compartment and the peaks of saturated lipids at 1.3 and 2.03 ppm in medial tibial compartment may be clinically useful to characterize subchondral bone marrow among healthy controls, acute ACL-injured patients, and patients with OA.

Single voxel spectroscopy is a simple commonly used technique for in vivo examination of metabolites within a small volume of tissue. This technique provides a powerful noninvasive and nondestructive chemical assessment tool for studying vertebral body bone marrow , evaluating the metabolites and biochemical profiles in gliomas and other human brain tumors , and investigating the lipid metabolism of human skeletal muscles .

Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is associated with increased risk for the development of posttraumatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) 10–20 years after the injury . Before the onset of structural changes, the cartilage tissue is subject to molecular modifications within the cartilage matrix . OA is the main cause of mobility-related disability in elderly persons . Although cartilage loss is the leading pathologic feature of OA, abnormal bone has been documented as another possible etiology . Felson et al. have revealed that bone marrow edema-like (BMEL) lesions are a potential risk factor for structural deterioration in knee OA, and BMEL lesions strongly correlate with the presence of pain in patients with OA. On the other hand, significantly elevated water and unsaturated lipids, and decreased saturated lipids are seen in BMEL lesions that are subjacent to areas of cartilage degeneration in OA . Other literature has indicated that some weight-bearing joints such as the knee and hip suffering from OA resulted from increased joint mechanical loading, and some possible risk factors such as obesity and knee pain because of previous injury may play an important role in the process of OA .
