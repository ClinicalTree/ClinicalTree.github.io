## Purpose

To evaluate local tumor control and survival rate after repeated transarterial chemoembolization using two different protocols in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 190 patients (mean, 68 years) with HCC were repeatedly treated with transarterial chemoembolization in 4-week intervals. The chemotherapy protocol consisted of mitomycin C alone ( _n_ = 111) and mitomycin C with gemcitabine ( _n_ = 79). Embolization was performed with lipiodol and microspheres. Tumor response was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method.

## Results

In the mitomycin C–only group, we observed partial response in 38.8% (43/111), stable disease in 27% (30/111), and progressive disease in 34.2% (38/111). In the mitomycin C/gemcitabine group ( _n_ = 79), partial response was observed in 43% (34/79), stable disease in 16.5% (13/79) and progressive disease in 40.5% (32/79). The overall 1- and 2-year survival rates were 56% and 28%, respectively. The overall median survival time from the start of transarterial chemoembolization treatment was 15 months. The median survival of patients treated with mitomycin C was 16.5 months and it was 12 months for patients treated with a combination of mitomycin C and gemcitabine. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was observed ( _P_ = .7).

## Conclusion

Chemoembolization is an effective minimally invasive therapy option for palliative treatment of HCC patients. Mitomycin C only proves to be effective, the addition of gemcitabine was not advantageous.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common solid-organ malignancies worldwide. Moreover, recent data suggest that the incidence and mortality of HCC in western nations is on the rise, and HCC is currently the leading cause of death among cirrhotic patients .

However, most HCC patients are unresectable at diagnosis because of multicentricity, large tumor size or a poor hepatic functional reserve due to preexisting cirrhosis, or they are not transplantable because of an advanced tumor stage or severe comorbidity . Therefore transarterial chemoembolization seems to be more important as a treatment strategy .
