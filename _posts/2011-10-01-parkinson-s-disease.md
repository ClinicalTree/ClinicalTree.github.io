## Rationale and Objectives

Early-stage diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is essential in making decisions related to treatment and prognosis. However, there is no specific diagnostic test for the diagnosis of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of texture analysis (TA) of magnetic resonance images in detecting subtle changes between the hemispheres in various brain structures in patients with early symptoms of parkinsonism. In addition, functional TA parameters for detecting textural changes are presented.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-one patients with symptoms of PD and 20 healthy controls were imaged using a 3-T magnetic resonance device. Co-occurrence matrix–based TA was applied to detect changes in textures between the hemispheres in the following clinically interesting areas: dentate nucleus, basilar pons, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, corona radiata, and centrum semiovale. The TA results were statistically evaluated using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test.

## Results

The results showed interhemispheric textural differences among the patients, especially in the area of basilar pons and midbrain. Concentrating on this clinically interesting area, the four most discriminant parameters were defined: co-occurrence matrix correlation, contrast, difference variance, and sum variance. With these parameters, differences were also detected in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus, and corona radiata.

## Conclusions

On the basis of this study, interhemispheric differences in the magnetic resonance images of patients with PD can be identified by the means of co-occurrence matrix–based TA. The detected areas correlate with the current pathophysiologic and neuroanatomic knowledge of PD.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system. Signs of PD include rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and the loss of postural reflexes . There is no specific diagnostic test for PD, and therefore the disease is diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. Early-stage diagnosis of PD or other degenerative causes of parkinsonism is essential for deciding on treatment and prognosis, but early-stage disease may be difficult to recognize because it usually begins subtly. In addition, diagnosis is complicated because symptoms of other neurologic conditions resemble those of PD.

Among other symptoms, PD is characterized pathophysiologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta . The structure participates in controlling voluntary movements, and when information transfer is disturbed by the loss of neurotransmitter dopamine, the consequences can be seen as symptoms of PD . The identification of the midbrain dopaminergic regions is useful for evaluating the structural changes associated with PD .
