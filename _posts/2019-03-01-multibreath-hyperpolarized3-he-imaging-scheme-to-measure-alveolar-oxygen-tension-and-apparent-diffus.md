## Rationale and Objectives

In this study, we compared a newly developed multibreath simultaneous alveolar oxygen tension and apparent diffusion coefficient ( _P_ A O  2 -ADC) imaging sequence to a single-breath acquisition, with the aim of mitigating the compromising effects of intervoxel flow and slow-filling regions on single-breath measurements, especially in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects.

## Materials and Methods

Both single-breath and multibreath simultaneous _P_ A O  2 -ADC imaging schemes were performed on a total of 10 human subjects (five asymptomatic smokers and five COPD subjects). Estimated _P_ A O  2 and ADC values derived from the different sequences were compared both globally and regionally. The distribution of voxels with nonphysiological values was also compared between the two schemes.

## Results

The multibreath protocol decreased the ventilation defect volumes by an average of 12.9 ± 6.6%. The multibreath sequence generated nonphysiological _P_ A O  2 values in 11.0 ± 8.5% fewer voxels than the single-breath sequence. Single-breath _P_ A O  2 maps also showed more regions with gas-flow artifacts and general signal heterogeneity. On average, the standard deviation of the _P_ A O  2 distribution was 16.5 ± 7.0% lower using multibreath _P_ A O  2 -ADC imaging, suggesting a more homogeneous gas distribution. Both mean and standard deviation of the ADC increased significantly from single- to multibreath imaging ( _p_ = 0.048 and _p_ = 0.070, respectively), suggesting more emphysematous regions in the slow-filling lung.

## Conclusion

Multibreath _P_ A O  2 -ADC imaging provides superior accuracy and efficiency compared to previous imaging protocols. _P_ A O  2 and ADC maps generated by multibreath imaging allowed for the qualification of various regions as emphysematous or obstructed, which single-breath _P_ A O  2 maps can only identify as defects. The simultaneous _P_ A O  2 and ADC measurements generated by the presented multibreath method were also more physiologically realistic, and allowed for more detailed analysis of the slow-filling regions characteristic of COPD subjects.

## Introduction

Hyperpolarized (HP) gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as a technique capable of safely detecting a variety of changes in the lungs such as air flow restriction, airspace enlargement, decreased tissue perfusion, alveolar membrane thickening, and air trapping ( ), thereby expanding upon the parameters available from conventional modalities like computed tomography and x-ray imaging, and enabling the accurate, regional evaluation of gas flow and uptake ( ).

Two parameters that HP gas MRI is uniquely capable of assessing are regional alveolar oxygen tension ( _P_ A O  2 ), which reflects oxygen delivery to the parenchyma and uptake into the blood, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), which describes the diffusion of gas within various regions of the lung. Because _P_ A O  2 reflects the balance between gas replacement through ventilation and uptake into the blood, it is sensitive to early manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), an inflammatory lung condition causing chronic obstruction of airflow. ADC, on the other hand, is primarily indicative of structural changes in alveolar size and connectivity that are expected later in disease progression ( ). Often acquired simultaneously and coregistered, _P_ A O  2 and ADC can serve as important indicators of pathophysiological changes in the lungs ( ), and together provide a more comprehensive portrait of lung function and structure than is available with other methods—increasing sensitivity to early subclinical alterations and, thereby, diagnostic power ( ).

Although the numerical value of ADC can vary with gradient duration even as _b_ 0 is held constant, we utilize the commonly chosen standard diffusion pulse timing parameters with no interpulse delay ( ).
