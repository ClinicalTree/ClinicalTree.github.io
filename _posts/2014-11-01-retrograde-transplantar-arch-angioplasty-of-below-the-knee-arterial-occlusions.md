## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the clinical outcomes of retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty and conventional below-the-knee (BTK) anterograde recanalization.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred twelve limbs in 96 patients underwent attempt at antegrade tibial angioplasty. Among 27 technical failures, retrograde trans-dorsal or -planter percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was attempted in 22 limbs. Ankle–brachial index (ABI), thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade, and dorsal/plantar arterial pulse score improvement were compared immediately after the procedures between patients received successful anterograde angioplasty (anterograde angioplasty group \[AAG\], 85 limbs in 71 patients) and retrograde angioplasty (retrograde angioplasty group \[RAG\], 22 limbs in 20 patients). Target vessel restenosis and limb salvage were observed during follow-up.

## Results

Primary technical success rate was 75.9% in the RAG (vs. 74.0% AAG, _P_ > .05). ABI improved from 0.55 ± 0.21 to 0.93 ± 0.19 in the RAG (vs. 0.56 ± 0.14 to 0.89 ± 0.18 AAG, _P_ > .05). TIMI flow grade demonstrated greater reperfusion of distal foot tissue in the RAG (2.3 ± 0.8 vs. 1.0 ± 0.8, _P_ < .05). Primary patency rates at 12 and 24 months were 63.6% (14 of 22) and 45.5% (10 of 22) in the RAG and 52.9% (45 of 85) and 37.6% (32 of 85) in the AAG, respectively ( _P_ > .05). Kaplan–Meier analysis after 24 months found limb salvage rates of 93.8% in the RAG and 96.5% in the AAG ( _P_ > .05).

## Conclusions

Retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty achieved better immediate blood flow and similar ABI improvement, primary patency rate, and limb salvage rate compared to conventional transtibial angioplasty for BTK occlusions. This could become a supplementary technique when anterograde angioplasty fails.

In patients with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease is a major vascular complication associated with high morbidity and mortality . Severe occlusive disease is often observed in the leg, especially in below-the-knee (BTK) arteries . The development of long balloons and new interventional procedures has provided effective treatments , but the success rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for BTK arterial occlusion remains suboptimal because of poor vessel runoff and high surgical risk. Since Fusaro et al. reported a case of plantar to dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) subintimal angioplasty (SA), there have been several reports on retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty in BTK arterial occlusion . However, most published articles are case reports or small sample studies and focused mainly on the technical success rate. There is a lack of research comparing retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty with anterograde angioplasty in terms of clinical outcome, vascular restenosis, and limb salvage rate. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical results of retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty via the DPA or the lateral plantar artery (LPA) for BTK arterial occlusion with those of conventional angioplasty.

## Materials and methods

## Patient Information

One hundred twelve limbs in 96 patients underwent attempt at antegrade tibial angioplasty. Among 27 technical failures, retrograde trans-dorsal or -planter PTA was attempted in 22 limbs. Ninety-one successfully treated patients were divided into a conventional anterograde angioplasty group (AAG; 85 limbs in 71 patients) and a retrograde angioplasty group (RAG; 22 limbs in 20 patients); other angioplasty techniques such as collateral vessel angioplasty and subintimal arterial flossing with antegrade–retrograde intervention technique via direct puncture of the DPA or the anterior or posterior tibial artery were beyond the scope of this study. Ulcer was present in four (18.2%) limbs in the RAG and 12 (14.1%) limbs in the AAG. Rest pain was present in four (18.5%) limbs in the RAG and 11 (12.9%) limbs in the AAG. The general condition and clinical data of the patients are outlined in  Table 1 . All patients underwent a detailed physical examination, clinical assessments, and radiologic evaluation, including DPA or LPA pulse volume score, ankle–brachial index (ABI), and lower limb magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or arterial ultrasonography. Indications of arterial occlusive disease on evaluation were reduction or absence of DPA or LPA pulse; ABI <0.9 (in the absence of arterial calcification); and vascular occlusion of BTK arteries confirmed by lower limb MRA or arterial ultrasonography. When two of these three indications were present, digital subtraction angiography was performed to further assess the vascular condition, with subsequent angioplasty if necessary.

![Figure 1, A 75-year-old man had diabetes for 20 years. His left foot had a long occlusion of the anterior tibial artery ( a , arrow ) and dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) ( b , arrow ). Angiography showed almost completely occluded vessels in parts of the DPA and the deep perforating artery ( c , arrow ). Transtibial subintimal angioplasty was performed to open the occluded segments of the DPA and the anterior tibial artery ( d and e , arrows ). Because the guide wire failed to enter the true lumen of the deep perforating artery, retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty via the lateral plantar artery was performed to establish anterior foot circulation ( f , arrow ). Recanalization of the anterior tibial artery and DPA-directed blood flow to the posterior foot circulation ( g and h , arrows ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/RetrogradeTransplantarArchAngioplastyofBelowtheKneeArterialOcclusions/0_1s20S1076633214002281.jpg)

![Figure 2, A 76-year-old woman had diabetes for 14 years and an ulcer on her second toe; she also had a long occlusion of the anterior tibial artery in her left foot ( a , arrow ) and her dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) ( b , arrow ). The deep perforating artery and pedal arch exhibited a severely stenotic and tortuous segment ( c , arrow ). Transtibial subintimal angioplasty was performed ( d , arrow ), but flow in the dilated DPA remained halted ( e , arrow ). Because of perforation of the first distal metatarsal artery ( f , arrowhead ) when a guide wire was used to pass though the deep perforating artery, retrograde transplantar arch angioplasty via the lateral plantar artery was performed for pre-recanalization of the occluded artery ( f , arrow ). The reconstructed left anterior tibial artery and DPA now have direct blood flow to the posterior foot circulation ( g and h , arrows ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/RetrogradeTransplantarArchAngioplastyofBelowtheKneeArterialOcclusions/1_1s20S1076633214002281.jpg)
