## Rationale and Objectives

Women are under-represented in the field of radiology, occupy a minority of leadership positions, and, at our institution, have not achieved the same level of academic success as their male counterparts. Consequently, the authors designed, implemented, and evaluated the Leadership Intervention to Further the Training of Female Faculty (LIFT-OFF) program to (1) improve access to opportunities for women's faculty development and advancement, and (2) improve clarification of expectations about the role and path of advancement.

## Materials and Methods

LIFT-OFF was developed based on the results of a needs assessment survey. The results generated 14 priority topics, which served as the basis for educational modules conducted by expert speakers. Module effectiveness was assessed with pre- and postsurveys to elicit participant knowledge about the targeted subject matter. A formative program evaluation was performed at the completion of year 1 of 2 to assess outcomes and impacts to date.

## Results

Seventeen of 55 (31%) educational module post-survey questions demonstrated a statistically significant ( _P_ < 0.05) increase in “yes” responses, indicating an improved understanding of targeted information. At year 1, 75% of the participants indicated that the program improved access to faculty development opportunities and 62% reported improved access to career advancement opportunities. Satisfaction with pace of professional advancement increased from 25% to 46% for junior women faculty ( _P_ = 0.046).

## Conclusions

Faculty development programs such as LIFT-OFF can provide career development opportunities and executive skills necessary for women to achieve academic career success and assume leadership positions.

## Introduction

Data from the Association of American Medical College's Faculty Forward Engagement Survey suggest that for women faculty to be successful, they should benefit from (1) clear expectations about the role and path of advancement, (2) an equitable and diverse workplace, and (3) access to opportunities for development and advancement . Likewise, substantive improvements in the development of women's careers and success in retaining women faculty were demonstrated after the implementation of a “Career Development for Women in Academic Medicine” program in the Department of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University. More importantly, this intervention was found to benefit not only the women faculty, but all faculty members .

Women remain under-represented in radiology (22% of radiologists are women) despite steady parity of gender enrollment in medical school over the past 10 years (46% of enrollees are women) . As an additional concern, women occupy a minority of radiology leadership positions, with only 7% of leaders being women. The last 10 years has seen a minimal increase in the number of women program directors and virtually no increase in the number of chairwomen . This lack of women in leadership positions may result in a lack of role models to attract women medical students. For many women in internal medicine and surgery, access to female role models played a large role in the determination of specialty choice . Additionally, analysis of women medical students' interest in radiology careers has demonstrated that effective role models have a direct, positive influence on interest levels in radiology careers . Increasing the number of women in leadership roles in radiology has the potential to generate an overall increase in the number of women faculty members, maintain perspective of women, and attract future generations of women radiologists. It is imperative to improve faculty development for women in radiology to retain and advance the current women in academic radiology and to attract women to the field of radiology.
