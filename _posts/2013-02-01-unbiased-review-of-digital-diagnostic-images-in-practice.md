## Rationale and Objectives

Clinical and contextual information associated with images may influence how radiologists draw diagnostic inferences, highlighting the need to control multiple sources of bias in the methodologic design of investigations involving radiologic interpretation. In the past, manual control methods to mask review films presented in practice have been used to reduce potential interpretive bias associated with differences between viewing images for patient care and reviewing images for the purposes of research, education, and quality improvement. These manual precedents from the film era raise the question whether similar methods to reduce bias can be implemented in the modern digital environment.

## Materials and Methods

A prototype application, CreateAPatient, was built for masking review case presentations within one institution’s production radiology information system and picture archiving and communication system. To test whether CreateAPatient could be used to mask review images presented in practice, six board-certified radiologists participated in a pilot study. During pilot testing, seven digital chest radiographs, known to contain lung nodules and associated with fictitious patient identifiers, were mixed into the routine workloads of the participating radiologists while they covered general evening call shifts. The aim was to test whether it was possible to mask the presentation of these review cases, both by probing the interpreting radiologists to report detection and by conducting a forced-choice experiment on a separate cohort of 20 radiologists and information technology professionals.

## Results

None of the participating radiologists reported awareness of review activity, and forced-choice detection was less than predicted at chance, suggesting that radiologists were effectively blinded. In addition, no evidence was identified of review reports unsafely propagating beyond their intended scope or otherwise interfering with patient care, despite integration of these records within production electronic work flow systems.

## Conclusions

Information technology can facilitate the design of unbiased methods involving professional review of digital diagnostic images.

Clinical and contextual information associated with images may influence how radiologists draw diagnostic inferences. For example, in mammography, when a regularly screened woman receives a diagnosis of breast cancer without suspicion having been raised on her last screening mammogram, a quality-related question naturally arises: Were the results of the last screening mammogram truly negative? Multiple studies of these positive “interval cancer” mammograms suggest that the answer to this question is complex. As an extreme illustrative example, one reviewer in a recent study reported positive findings in three of 20 interval-cancer mammograms when they were deidentified and presented mixed with normal mammograms, but positive findings were reported in 17 of the same 20 mammograms when they were unmixed and associated with additional clinical information. When aggregating these data statistically, the magnitude of design effects remains significant and large, with positive finding rates ranging over an order of magnitude across review conditions in most studies .

The importance of review design is not limited to studies of interval breast cancer. Semelka et al recently reported that of 31 external radiologist reviewers, none documented suspicion of spinal instability when reviewing a computed tomographic scan showing 1-mm symmetric facet widening at T10. The study scan was presented with five control scans in the context of a quality assurance review. Study reviewers were not informed that the computed tomographic examination had also been the subject of a settled lawsuit, in which four of four expert witnesses for the plaintiff had represented the spinal instability findings as expected per standard of care.
