## Purpose

To investigate the prevalence of significant coronary artery stenosis on coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) in symptomatic Caucasian patients with an intermediate risk score at different levels of coronary artery calcification (CAC).

## Method

In total, 383 consecutive symptomatic Caucasian patients (147 females, 60 ± 13 years) with an intermediate risk score underwent nonenhanced CT for CAC scoring immediately before contrast-enhanced cCTA on a dual-source CT scanner. Additionally clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography (ICA) was performed in 90 patients. The prevalence of significant coronary artery stenosis (>50%) on cCTA and ICA was correlated at different CAC score levels.

## Results

Of 121 patients with a zero CAC score, none had significant coronary artery stenosis on cCTA or ICA. Coronary CTA diagnosed in 54 of 70 patients with high CAC score (>400), a significant stenosis. Subsequent ICA confirmed significant stenosis in 30 of 32 patients. Sensitivity and a negative predictive value of CAC score ruling out significant stenosis on cCTA were 100% and 100%, respectively, using cutoff value of zero and specificity and positive predictive value to predict significant stenosis on cCTA were 79% and 51%, respectively, using a cutoff value of >400.

## Conclusion

Significant coronary artery stenosis is extremely unlikely, with an estimated risk of 4 in 1000 patients in symptomatic Caucasian patients with an intermediate risk score and negative CAC score. To reduce radiation exposure, radiation-free tests should be considered for differential diagnosis of chest pain in these patients.

Patients who present at the emergency department complaining of acute chest pain place a substantial economic burden on the health care system. In 2004 alone, more than 6 million of such visits occurred in the United States, with an estimated 30% resulting in hospitalization for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) . However, only a small percentage of those admitted to the hospital for acute chest pain is eventually diagnosed with ACS .

A large body of literature has shown that coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) has a high sensitivity to rule out coronary artery stenosis in patients with acute chest pain . Thus, cCTA may be a valuable discriminatory tool for clinical management of these patients. However, a major issue with cCTA is the associated radiation exposure. Recently, several studies have evaluated the radiation exposure associated with cCTA and have reported large variations, with effective doses of up to 30 mSv . Concerns about cCTA radiation exposure have regenerated interest in coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurements because the nonenhanced CT needed for coronary calcium scoring is typically associated with a much lower radiation dose than contrast-enhanced cCTA. The presence of calcium in the coronary arteries is a well-known and pathognomonic marker for atherosclerotic disease . Screening of the asymptomatic population for detection of early-stage coronary artery disease is one of the most promising applications of CAC scoring. Repeat CAC measurements with CT (CAC-CT) can successfully track the progression of atherosclerosis in different clinical settings .
