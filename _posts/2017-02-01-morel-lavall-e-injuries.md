Morel-Lavallée lesions are relatively rare closed degloving injuries caused by a shearing force resulting in separation of the dermis and the hypodermis from the subjacent deeper fascia. Although most commonly encountered lateral to the greater trochanter, these injuries may occur throughout the body in a variety of locations. Separation of the hypodermal tissue planes results in a complex serosanguinous fluid collection with areas of internal fat necrosis. The imaging appearance is variable and nonspecific, potentially mimicking superficial hemorrhagic bursitis, or cystic or necrotic primary soft tissue neoplasms. If not treated in the acute or early subacute setting, these collections are at risk of superinfection, overlying tissue necrosis, and continued expansion. In this article, we will review the pathophysiology, cross-sectional imaging features, and differential diagnostic considerations of Morel-Lavallée lesions as well as discuss management and treatment options.

## Introduction

First described in 1863 by the French physician Maurice Morel-Lavallée as a posttraumatic fluid collection arising in the proximal thigh of a patient who had fallen from a moving train, Morel-Lavallée (ML) lesions are closed internal degloving injuries secondary to a tangential shearing force separating the subdermal fascial planes . The resultant hemolymphatic fluid collection has also been alternatively termed a posttraumatic soft tissue cyst or pseudocyst, ancient or chronic expanding hematoma, ML effusion, or extravasation . Delayed or slow progressive enlargement may obscure initial clinical detection, with up to one third of patients presenting months or years after the inciting injury . Motor vehicle collisions are the most commonly reported etiology, although ML lesions have been described following lower energy injury sustained during contact sports such as wrestling and football . The surrounding inflammatory reaction leads to the formation of a peripheral encapsulation, hindering resolution and facilitating slow enlargement due to hemolymphatic internal leakage . Most commonly, ML lesions form at the level of the greater trochanter and the proximal thigh, following pelvic trauma . Dependent on the internal age of the hemorrhage and proportions of lymphatic and hemorrhagic fluid, the imaging appearance is variable, potentially mimicking other soft tissue pathology including hemorrhagic bursitis or primary soft tissue neoplasm . In this article, we will review the pathophysiology underlying ML lesions, imaging features and classification schemes, differential diagnostic considerations, and management options.

## Pathophysiology and Clinical Presentation

Following the initial traumatic event, most commonly a tangential shearing force to the pelvis or the lower extremity, there is a closed disruption of the dermal and subdermal tissue plane fat from the underlying superficial fascia . Motor vehicle accidents are the most common inciting event, with high-energy trauma responsible for more than 50% of injuries sustained; however, low-grade blunt force trauma including falls and sport-related injuries account for a significant minority of cases . Postoperative cases have also been reported involving the anterior abdominal wall following liposuction . The lower limb, most often at the level of the greater trochanter, is the most commonly involved region, with injuries at this level accounting for more than 60% of cases . Predisposing factors at this location include the superficial position of the femoral cortex, relative mobility of the subdermal soft tissues, limited arterial perforator arborization from the lateral femoral circumflex vasculature, and strength of the underlying tensor fascia lata . Reported secondary demographic risk factors include female gender and a body mass index of 25 or higher . In addition to the greater trochanter, other reported sites in decreasing incidence include the thigh, pelvis, knee, gluteal region, lumbosacral trunk, abdominal wall, distal lower extremity, and calvarium . Underlying concomitant fractures may be present in a minority of cases . Although rare, bilateral ML lesions have been reported . Pediatric cases are less common but do occur, with the youngest reported patient aged 28 months .

With the disruption of the subdermal capillaries and lymphatics, hemorrhage, lymphatic fluid, and locules of subdermal fat can accumulate in the suprafascial tissue plane. With temporal evolution, there is resorption of the hemorrhagic elements and increase of serosanguineous fluid. Progressive fibrous encapsulation prohibits resorption and allows slow continued expansion .

Clinical presentation of ML lesions is usually in close proximity to the inciting traumatic event, although up to one third of patients may present in a delayed fashion with gradual swelling months or years after the initial injury . Pain and swelling are the most frequent clinical complaints, with a compressible, fluctuant area typically detectable on physical examination . Clinical findings may mimic a regional contusion or even deep venous thrombosis . Cutaneous hypoesthesia or anesthesia may be observed owing to the disruption of the subdermal afferent nerves . Overlying secondary dermal changes include drying and cracking, discoloration, and less commonly frank necrosis .

## Imaging Features

In the setting of trauma, radiography may often be the first imaging modality employed. Besides evaluating for osseous integrity, there is minimal contribution to the final diagnosis other than potential delineation of regional swelling and exclusion of associated soft tissue calcification .

Nonspecific peripheral capsular enhancement is seen. Although a chronic hematoma or inflammatory collection would be a consideration, the presence of internal foci of low attenuation, isodense to the adjacent subcutaneous fat, supports the diagnosis of a chronic Morel-Lavallée shearing injury in this patient status post remote injury. Although these examples were obtained from different patients, the internal lipomatous foci as seen above ( blue arrow ) would correspond to the echogenic intracapsular nodular focus seen previously in Figure 1 .

A faint low T2 signal capsule is suggested ( blue arrow ). Internal signal heterogeneity at the level of the proximal femoral head and neck is incidentally observed compatible with prior intramedullary screw fixation. Although the location and traumatic history support the diagnosis of a Morel-Lavallée lesion, the appearance is nonspecific, potentially mimicking a chronic seroma or myxoma.

A low signal intensity rim is observed compatible with hemosiderin deposition and fibrous encapsulation ( blue arrow ). Internally, there is a focal area of rounded nodularity isointense to that of subdermal fat ( red arrow ). (b) Coronal T2 fat-saturated image at the same level as (a) demonstrates progressive loss of signal intensity at site of previously seen hyperintense internal nodule ( blue arrow ) compatible with a sheared island of subdermal fat, supporting the diagnosis of a Morel-Lavallée lesion.

## Differential Diagnostic Considerations

![Figure 7, Sagittal FSE T2-weighted fat-suppressed image through the central knee demonstrates a longitudinally extensive T2 hyperintense subdermal fluid collection in the prepatellar region ( blue arrow ). Although the appearance superficially mimics that of prepatellar bursitis, extension superiorly over the myotendinous quadriceps junction is observed ( red arrow ), beyond the expected physiologic bursal confines, compatible with a Morel-Lavallée lesion in this patient status post prior blunt trauma. A faint peripheral capsule is observed with minimal areas of internal low T2 signal inferiorly corresponding to fibrinous stranding ( green arrow ). FSE, fast spin echo. (Color version of figure is available online.)](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MorelLavalleInjuries/6_1s20S1076633216303269.jpg)

![Figure 8, (a) Sagittal T1 image at the level of the right knee midline demonstrates a high signal intensity elliptiform fluid collection in the prepatellar soft tissues overlying the patella and the patellar tendon ( blue arrow ). Internal areas of low signal serpiginous stranding are observed ( red arrow ). (b) Fat-suppressed sagittal PD-weighted image at the same level re-demonstrates a complex subdermal fluid collection overlying the patellar tendon with internal serpiginous areas of low signal intensity ( red arrow ). Absence of fat suppression supports serosanguineous or proteinaceous nature. No corresponding increased signal was seen on T1 images in the areas of internal debris to suggest sheared lipoid tissue. Imaging characteristics, as well as the characteristic location corresponding to the infrapatellar superficial bursa and absence of prior traumatic history, support the diagnosis of hemorrhagic bursitis. PD, proton density. (Color version of figure is available online.)](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MorelLavalleInjuries/7_1s20S1076633216303269.jpg)

![Figure 9, (a) Axial fat-saturated T2-weighted FSE image at the level of the right hip demonstrates an ovoid area of increased signal intensity abutting the superficial aspect of the tensor fascia lata and quadriceps musculature ( blue arrow ). Close inspection demonstrates the lesion to be deep to the muscular fascia, atypical for the subdermal location of a Morel-Lavallée shear injury. (b) Axial post-contrasted T1-weighted fat-saturated image of the same lesion at the level of the anterior proximal right thigh demonstrates the lesion to be solid with diffuse, heterogeneous internal enhancement. Myxoid liposarcoma was found at surgical resection. Myxomas, hemangiopericytomas, synovial sarcomas, and myxoid liposarcomas can demonstrate relatively indolent smooth margination, and high T2 signal, potentially mimicking a Morel-Lavallée lesion. Close inspection for a Morel-Lavallee lesion's wholly subdermal location and thin, smooth capsular enhancement can aid in discrimination. FSE, fast spin echo.
