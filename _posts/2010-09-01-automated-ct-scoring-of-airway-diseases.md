## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate an automated global scoring system for evaluating the extent and severity of disease in a known cohort of patients with documented bronchiectasis. On the basis of a combination of validated three-dimensional automated algorithms for bronchial tree extraction and quantitative airway measurements, global scoring combines the evaluation of bronchial lumen–to–artery ratios and bronchial wall–to–artery ratios, as well as the detection of mucoid-impacted airways. The result is an automatically generated global computed tomographic (CT) score designed to simplify and standardize the interpretation of scans in patients with chronic airway infections.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty high-resolution CT data sets were used to evaluate an automated CT scoring method that combines algorithms for airway quantitative analysis that have been individually tested and validated. Patients with clinically documented atypical mycobacterial infections with visually assessed CT evidence of bronchiectasis varying from mild to severe were retrospectively selected. These data sets were evaluated by two independent experienced radiologists and by computer scoring, with the results compared statistically, including Spearman's rank correlation.

## Results

Computer evaluation required 3 to 5 minutes per data set, compared to 12 to 15 minutes for manual scoring. Initial Spearman's rank tests showed positive correlations between automated and readers' global scores ( _r_ = 0.609, _P_ = .01), extent of bronchiectasis ( _r_ = 0.69, _P_ = .0004), and severity of bronchiectasis ( _r_ = 0.61, _P_ = .01), while mucus plug detection showed a lesser extent of positive correlation between the scoring methods ( _r_ = 0.42, _P_ = .07) and wall thickness a negative weak correlation ( _r_ = −0.10, _P_ = .40). Further retrospective review of 24 lobes in which wall thickness scores showed the highest discrepancy between manual and automated methods was then performed, using electronic calipers and perpendicular cross-sections to reassess airway measurements. This resulted in an improved Spearman's rank correlation to _r_ = 0.62 ( _P_ = .009), for a global score of _r_ = 0.67 ( _P_ = .001).

## Conclusion

Automated computerized scoring shows considerable promise for providing a standardized, quantitative method, demonstrating overall good correlation with the results of experienced readers' evaluation of the extent and severity of bronchiectasis. It is speculated that this technique may also be applicable to a wide range of other conditions associated with chronic bronchial inflammation, as well as of potential value for monitoring response to therapy in these same populations.

Visual computed tomographic (CT) scoring systems have been established for the assessment of airway disease in patients with bronchiectasis. Bhalla et al , in the most detailed method to date, used nine separate variables, including mucus plugging extent, peribronchial thickening, bronchial generations involved, number of bullae, and the presence of emphysema, plus a three-point severity scale, to create a 25-point global CT score. A number of modifications to this approach have subsequently been suggested . Generally, these modifications have encompassed differences in the definitions of bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, and disease extent as measured either by segments or lobes. Only some emphasize the presence of mucoid impaction and focal air trapping .

Despite these differences, to date, visual CT scoring systems have consistently shown good correlations with more traditional radiographic, clinical, and functional criteria . Roberts et al showed that the extent and severity of bronchial dilatation and bronchial wall thickening in patients with bronchiectasis were correlated with the severity of airflow obstruction and that decreased lung attenuation on expiratory scans had the best correlation ( _r_ = −0.55, _P_ < .00005). Similarly, Edwards et al showed a strong relationship between the extent of bronchiectasis, bronchial wall thickening, and air trapping on CT imaging with forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity .
