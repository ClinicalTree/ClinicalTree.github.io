## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to describe the mammographic, sonographic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ.

## Materials and Methods

Between May 2004 and April 2008, the pathology database of a single institution was reviewed for patients diagnosed with histologically proven DCIS with a predominant micropapillary component. Clinical data and preoperative imaging studies, including mammography, sonography, and/or MRI, were reviewed.

## Results

Forty-one patients (mean age, 55 years; range, 33–82 years) with 42 tumors were included in this study. Most tumors ( _n_ = 32 \[76%\]) were detected on screening mammography, with a mean tumor size of 4.7 cm (range, 0.5–13 cm). Of 42 tumors, seven (16%) were multicentric, and 23 (54%) were high nuclear grade. Calcifications were identified in 36 tumors (86%) on mammography, most frequently with pleomorphic morphology (15 tumors \[42%\]). Sonography was frequently normal (17 of 36 \[47%\]). When abnormal, irregular mass and angular margins were the most common sonographic features. All four tumors with MRI showed non-mass-like enhancement and showed the best correlation with pathologic size.

## Conclusions

Micropapillary ductal carcinoma in situ is a unique subset of in situ cancer that is frequently clinically occult but has a large mean size at diagnosis and demonstrates highly suspicious features at imaging including pleomorphic calcifications on mammography and an irregular mass at sonography. MRI may be the imaging modality of choice for delineation of disease extent and warrants further validation.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is heterogeneous in histopathologic characteristics and biologic behavior . With the increased use of screening mammography, DCIS now accounts for 22% to 45% of breast cancers detected in patients undergoing biopsy for clinically occult lesions seen on mammography . Micropapillary DCIS is a subtype of DCIS characterized by the presence of papillary fronds that protrude into the ductal lumen in a regular distribution . This subtype of DCIS is frequently multifocal and multicentric, which may lead to underestimation of size by imaging modalities. Therefore, Scott et al proposed to separate pure cases of micropapillary DCIS to accrue prognostic information.

It is well documented that breast-conserving surgery followed by external-beam radiation is associated with a low rate of local recurrence, and survival is equivalent to treatment by mastectomy . Preoperative estimation of tumor size by mammography, sonography, and in some instances magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important in surgical planning to achieve histologic negative margins . Mammography has been shown to underestimate the histologic size of DCIS . The extent of size discrepancy was related to the histologic type of DCIS, the size of the micropapillary (cribriform) subtype of DCIS was more commonly underestimated on mammography compared to the comedo subtype, and frequently required one or more additional surgical procedures . To date, there are scant data in the literature describing the imaging characteristics of micropapillary DCIS. With this retrospective study, we aimed to describe the imaging features of micropapillary DCIS.
