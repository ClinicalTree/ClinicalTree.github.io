## Rationale and Objectives

Providing evidence-based appropriate imaging potentially increases diagnostic yield and prevents unnecessary imaging. The American College of Radiology's (ACR) evidence-based Appropriateness Criteria  ® (ACR-AC) were developed to provide imaging guidelines given various clinical scenarios. The goal of this study was to evaluate the knowledge level of the appropriate thoracic imaging study to be performed, given a clinical scenario.

## Methods

An online survey comprising 20 multiple-choice questions was developed on the basis of excerpts from the ACR-AC for thoracic imaging. The survey was piloted and invitations were sent out to resident trainees in radiology ( _n_ = 32), medicine ( _n_ = 119), and surgery ( _n_ = 40) and to pulmonary and critical medicine fellows ( _n_ = 16).

## Results

Sixty-nine trainees (33%) completed the survey. The trainees among those who completed the survey included 14 (20%) in radiology, 32 (46%) in medicine, eight (12%) in surgery, and 15 (22%) in pulmonary and critical medicine. Of the 69 trainees, most were male ( _n_ = 47 \[68%\]), aged 25 to 35 years ( _n_ = 65 \[94%\]), and in postgraduate years 1 to 3 ( _n_ = 44 \[64%\]). The overall median and percentage number of correct responses were 13 (interquartile range \[IQR\], 11–15) and 65% ( _n_ = 44), respectively. As would be expected, radiology residents performed better, with a median number of correct responses of 15 (IQR, 11–16) compared to 10 (IQR, 9–12) for medicine trainees, nine (IQR, 9–12) for surgery trainees, and 13 (IQR, 12–15) for pulmonary and critical medicine trainees. There was an increase in the median number of correct responses with years of training, ranging from 10 for postgraduate year 1 to 12 for postgraduate year 6.

## Conclusions

This study shows an opportunity to increase the awareness of the ACR-AC. Increasing the awareness of the ACR-AC among trainees will likely increase their use in practice and ultimately improve patient care.

Imaging studies remain an integral and growing component of health care. Providing the appropriate evidence-based imaging studies increases diagnostic yield and prevents unnecessary imaging and the concomitant delays in diagnosis . The American College of Radiology's (ACR) evidence-based Appropriateness Criteria  ® (ACR-AC) were developed to provide imaging guidelines for specific clinical scenarios . The ACR-AC have been available for more than a decade, but previous studies have suggested continued limited awareness among resident trainees and attending physicians . In academic institutions, resident trainees are responsible for most of the imaging ordering, and therefore the goal of this study was to evaluate the knowledge level of the appropriate imaging in the context of thoracic imaging. To that end, this study was based on the ACR-AC for thoracic imaging, available on the ACR's Web site .

## Methods

## Study Design

The study was performed at the Cleveleand Clinic Foundation (CCF) in Cleveland, Ohio during July and August 2010. We developed an online survey comprising 20 multiple-choice questions on the basis of direct excerpts from the ACR-AC for thoracic imaging . Multiple-choice responses were created to include the most appropriate choices as dictated in the ACR-AC document, along with other typical imaging alternatives. The survey was piloted and invitations were sent out to resident trainees in radiology ( _n_ = 32), medicine ( _n_ = 119), and surgery ( _n_ = 40) as well as fellows in pulmonary and critical medicine ( _n_ = 16). Two reminder e-mails were sent to the trainees at 3 and 6 weeks. At the end of the study, all trainees were provided with the most appropriate responses to the survey questions and Internet links to the relevant ACR-AC documents. There was no a priori assessment of knowledge or awareness of the ACR-AC, and such a question was not included in the survey to avoid subsequent Internet searches. Ethics approval exemption was obtained for the study from the institutional review board.
