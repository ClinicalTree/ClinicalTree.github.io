## Rationale and Objectives

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of developing dementia. This study aims to determine whether current standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is providing markers that can distinguish between subjects with amnestic MCI (aMCI), nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), and healthy controls (HCs).

## Materials and Methods

A subset of 126 MCI subjects and 126 age-, gender-, and education-appropriate HCs (mean age, 70.9 years) were recruited from 4157 participants in the longitudinal community-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. The burden of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy was evaluated on transversal MR images from a single 1.5-T MR scanner by two blinded neuroradiologists. Logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic analysis were used for statistical analysis.

## Results

Occipital WMH burden was significantly increased in aMCI, but not in naMCI relative to HCs ( _P_ = .01). The combined MCI group showed brain atrophy relative to HCs ( _P_ = .01) pronounced at caudate nuclei ( _P_ = .01) and temporal horn level ( _P_ = .004) of aMCI patients and increased at the frontal and occipital horns of naMCI patients compared to either aMCI or HCs. Microbleeds were equally distributed in the MCI and control group, but more frequent in aMCI (22 of 84) compared to naMCI subjects (3 of 23).

## Conclusions

In his cohort, increased occipital WMHs and cortical and subcortical brain atrophies at temporal horn and caudate nuclei level distinguished aMCI from naMCI subjects and controls. Volumetric indices appear of interest and should be assessed under reproducible conditions to gain diagnostic accuracy.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) describes a transitional state between cognitive changes of normal aging and dementia, especially Alzheimer disease (AD) . Hence, MCI is a risk factor for dementia with an estimated conversion rate of 10%–15% per year, compared to 1%–2% in the cognitively normal, elderly population . This prodromal AD state is diagnosed in the clinical setting by neurologic and neuropsychological assessment . Nonamnestic forms of MCI (naMCI) have shown findings related to vascular disease, whereas amnestic MCI (aMCI) subjects demonstrated demographic, genetic, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics similar to AD pathology . Despite a controversial definition of MCI as a diagnostic entity, because it does not constitute a homogeneous clinical syndrome, it is an ideal target for prevention and future therapies of dementia . An early diagnosis and differentiation of MCI subtypes may have a major impact on the selection of suitable prospective therapies in future. MRI examinations are not routinely included in clinical work-up of MCI, although brain tissue and brain volumetric changes may help to predict conversion from MCI to dementia . Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are often in focus of MR studies dealing with neurodegenerative diseases and dementia, but their predictive value in MCI or AD-converters remains unclear . Medial temporal lobe atrophy has been shown to be an important predictor for conversion from MCI to AD . The volume of the hippocampus, the entorhinal cortex, and amygdala is known to decline in early stages of AD . We hypothesized that the degrees of brain atrophy and the burden of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and CMBs on transversal 1.5-T MR images correlate with the clinical diagnosis of MCI. Thus, we compared MR signs in subjects with MCI (divided into amnestic and nonamnestic subtypes because of the different underlying etiology) with age-, gender-, and education-matched controls on transversal fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2\*-weighted images in a large German population-based study. This study aims to determine whether current standard MRI is providing markers that can distinguish between subjects with aMCI, naMCI, and HCs in a single study.

## Materials and methods

## Study Population and Sampling Procedure

The Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR; Risk Factors, Evaluation of Coronary Calcium and Lifestyle) study is a population-based prospective cohort study with 4814 subjects (age range, 45–75 years) randomly selected from mandatory lists of residence in the Ruhr area in Germany . The major aim of the HNR study was to evaluate the predictive value of coronary artery calcification using electron-beam computed tomography for myocardial infarction and cardiac death in comparison to cardiovascular risk factors. Study methods have been described elsewhere in detail .
