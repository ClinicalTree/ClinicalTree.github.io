## Rationale and Objectives

Deriving maximum benefit from radiology rotations in medical schools is challenging. Lack of education on appropriate imaging renders students feeling unprepared. This study compares the ability of undergraduate medical students to identify appropriate radiological investigations, both at the beginning and end of their final year of education, to those of residents in their first year of clinical practice.

## Materials and Methods

Twelve scenarios were extracted from the American College of Radiology's Appropriateness Criteria (ACR-AC) and a questionnaire was generated. One topic was selected from each of the 10 sections in the diagnostic section and two from the interventional section. The questionnaire was distributed to three groups. Group A was composed of medical students at the beginning of final year. Group B was composed of medical students at the end of final year. Group C was composed of residents at the end of their first year of clinical practice. Radiology residents were surveyed to assess familiarity with the ACR-AC among trainees in Ireland.

## Results

The total cohort included 160 participants. Group C ( _n_ = 35) performed significantly better than group A ( _n_ = 72) and group B ( _n_ = 53). There was no statistical difference in the mean scores achieved by group A and group B. Sixteen (73%) of 22 radiology trainees were familiar with the ACR-AC.

## Conclusions

A minimal improvement in the knowledge of medical students in requesting radiological investigations over the course of the final medical year, yet a significant impact of a relatively short period of “on-the-job” learning in the clinical setting, was indicated. Emphasis on education on appropriateness may offer an improvement in the utilization of radiology services and improve patient care.

## Introduction

Radiological investigations are important diagnostic tools in the evaluation of patients. Although the interpretation and reporting of radiological investigations are a core clinical activity for radiologists, an awareness of the utility, limitations, and risks associated with different imaging modalities is important for all doctors. Recent technological advances in computed tomography (CT), ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging have greatly increased the number of requests for these investigations by doctors . A combination of expeditious imaging processing and greater diagnostic information from the imaging modalities has rendered diagnostic imaging more attractive . The majority of specialties increasingly request medical imaging, and this has seen an upsurge in diagnostic imaging examinations performed in recent years .

With access to multiple imaging modalities becoming more commonplace, the reliance by healthcare providers on imaging has intensified significantly . Imaging services are estimated to have grown at twice the rate of other healthcare technologies over the last decade . Rise in the use of imaging in patient care means that, although imaging is being used to positively impact patient welfare in most circumstances, it is also being used inappropriately. The selection of the most appropriate radiological investigation is a combination of multiple competencies: the interpretation of the clinical presentation, due regard for available evidence and best practice, cost-effectiveness, limitations, and risk-benefit analysis. Deficiencies in the knowledge of the requesting doctor may contribute to inappropriate imaging, leading to subsequent image overutilization . Furthermore, inappropriate scanning may lead to identification of incidental findings unrelated to the patient's clinical presentation, may expose the patient to unnecessary risk, or may falsely reassure the patient or the clinician. Educational efforts by medical organizations have attempted to address this, and the need for improvement has been reiterated for a number of years .
