## Rationale and Objectives

Women continue to be under represented in diagnostic radiology. According to the Association of American Medical College's 2016 Physician Specialty Data Report, women made up only 25% of the field of diagnostic radiology in 2015. Our investigation centered on determining how factors influencing specialty choices differ for female medical students planning to pursue a residency in radiology versus other specialties. We also examined gender differences for male and female students choosing radiology.

## Materials and Methods

Using deidentified 2011–2016 Graduation Questionnaire data from the Association of American Medical College's national survey of fourth-year medical students, we analyzed cross-sectional data from 71,941 respondents on career intentions, including factors influencing their choice of specialty such as mentor, salary, debt, family considerations, and fit with interests/skills. The 10 most common specialty choices were reported by gender. Women choosing radiology were compared to women choosing other specialties in terms of factors influencing choice of specialty. Women were also compared to men choosing radiology.

## Results

Whereas 48% of all fourth-year medical students were women, only 26% of fourth-year medical students selecting radiology as a specialty were women. Radiology ranked fifth for men as the most common specialty choice, but 11th for women. Work/life balance, future family plans, salary, family expectations, high debt, and competitiveness of specialty were strong influencing factors for a significantly higher proportion of women selecting radiology than women selecting other specialties, but length of residency was a factor for a higher proportion of women in other specialties. Of students selecting radiology, a higher proportion of women than men said mentors were a strong factor (47% vs 37%).

## Conclusion

To reduce the gender disparity in radiology, active engagement of mentors in the profession should be a priority in radiology departments. Other factors such as promoting radiology as an intellectual specialty with strong positive attributes such as work/life balance and salary should be highlighted as well.

## Introduction

As with other specialties in medicine, the majority of physicians within the field of radiology are male. Study results of radiology workforce in 2014 showed that 22% were women, and 78% were men. This was in contrast to 18% women and 82% men who made up the radiology workforce from a survey in 2003 ( ).

Over the past few decades, the number of women entering the field of medicine has been increasing. In 2016, the number of females entering medical school was at a 10-year high, increasing by 6.2% from 2015.

Influencing Factors for Specialty Choice


How influential were the following in helping you choose your specialty? • Competitiveness of specialty • Family expectations • High level of educational debt • My future family plans • Mentor/role model influence • Work/life balance • Options for fellowship training • Fit with personality, interests and skills • Salary expectations • Content of specialty • Length of residency training

_Note_ : Responses were no (0), minor (1), moderate (2), or strong (3) influence.
