## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to optimize treatment decisions for patients with suspected stage T2 rectal cancer on the basis of mesorectal lymph node size at magnetic resonance imaging.

## Materials and Methods

A decision-analytic model was developed to predict outcomes for patients with stage T2 rectal cancer at magnetic resonance imaging. Node-positive patients were assumed to benefit from chemoradiation prior to surgery. Imperfect magnetic resonance imaging performance for primary cancer and mesorectal nodal staging was incorporated. Five triage strategies were considered for administering preoperative chemoradiation: treat all patients; treat for any mesorectal node >3, >5, and >7 mm in size; and treat no patients. If nodal metastases or unsuspected stage T3 disease went untreated preoperatively, postoperative chemoradiation was needed, resulting in poorer outcomes. For each strategy, rates of acute and long-term chemoradiation toxicity and of 5-year local recurrence were computed. Effects of input parameter uncertainty were evaluated in sensitivity analysis.

## Results

The optimal strategy depended on the outcome prioritized. Acute and long-term chemoradiation toxicity rates were minimized by triaging only patients with nodes >7 mm to preoperative chemoradiation (18.9% and 10.8%, respectively). A treat-all strategy minimized the 5-year local recurrence rate (5.6%). A 7-mm nodal triage threshold increased the 5-year local recurrence rate to 8.0%; when no patients were treated preoperatively, the local recurrence rate was 10.1%. With improved primary tumor staging, all outcomes could be further optimized.

## Conclusions

Mesorectal nodal size thresholds for preoperative chemoradiation should depend on the outcome prioritized: higher size thresholds reduce chemoradiation toxicity but increase recurrence rates. Improvements in nodal staging will have greater impact if primary tumor staging can be improved.

Rectal cancer remains a leading cause of malignancy in the United States, with 40,290 new cases predicted in 2012 . For patients with locally advanced disease, designated as stage T3 or node-positive disease, surgery with adjuvant chemoradiation has recently emerged as the standard of care . Primarily because of increased patient compliance, enhanced tumor radiosensitivity, and radiation sparing of the colonic segment that will be used as a future reservoir for stool, patient outcomes are optimized with preoperative (as opposed to postoperative) chemoradiation . As a result, optimal therapeutic choices hinge on the accuracy of initial staging; whereas patients with advanced disease benefit from preoperative adjuvant therapy, those with stage T2 (or less) node-negative disease may incur unnecessary treatment toxicities if overstaged and overtreated .

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been increasingly used for preoperative staging and treatment planning in patients with rectal cancer . To date, most studies of MRI performance in this setting have focused on its ability to discern stage T2 and T3 tumors . Several authors have proposed MRI criteria for determining primary tumor stage . Meaningful criteria for determining lymph node positivity at MRI, particularly for commonly visible mesorectal nodes, have been difficult to establish . With increasing nodal size, the likelihood of nodal malignancy is higher, but there is considerable overlap between the sizes of benign and malignant lymph nodes . Other criteria for detecting mesorectal lymph node metastases at MRI, on the basis of border or signal characteristics, can be subject to interpretation variability . Accurate determination of lymph node status is particularly critical for patients with tumors designated as stage T2 preoperatively, because suspected nodal involvement in these patients necessitates preoperative chemoradiation despite the primary tumor's T2 designation.

Base-case strategies included nodal size-based strategies for triage to preoperative chemoradiation and “treat-all” and “treat-none” strategies. Secondary analysis strategies were based on nodal border and signal intensity characteristics.
