## Rationale and Objectives

A lecture series aimed at providing new radiology residents a rapid course on the fundamental concepts of professionalism, safety, and interpretation of diagnostic imaging was established. Evaluation of the course’s educational value was attempted through surveys.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-six live 45-minute lectures presented by 16 or 17 faculty members were organized exclusively for the first class of radiology residents, held over a 2-month period at the beginning of certain weekdays. Online surveys were conducted after the course to gather feedback from residents. Average resident rotation evaluation scores were measured over the first semester for the two classes before and after this new course implementation.

## Results

The lecture series was successfully organized and implemented. A total of 33 residents sat through the course over three summers. Faculty reported a reasonable number of preparation hours, and 100% of residents indicated they valued the course. Comparison of class average evaluation scores before and after the existence of this 2-month course did not significantly change.

## Conclusions

This collection of introductory lectures on professionalism, safety, and diagnostic imaging, delivered early in the first year of the radiology residency, requires a reasonable number of invested preparation hours by the faculty but results in a universal increase in resident confidence. However, we were unable to demonstrate an objective improvement in resident performance on clinical rotations.

Residents beginning a diagnostic radiology residency arrive with highly varying skills and experiences pertinent to diagnostic imaging. Depending on prior medical school curricula and the content of internship training, individuals may have limited exposure to the imaging modalities and indications for appropriate imaging studies . Although novel educational and training modules have been described to prepare junior residents for independent call shifts , there is little literature specifically concerned with addressing the knowledge gaps in new radiology residents.

Before 2010, the first-year diagnostic radiology residents at our institution were provided with some didactic lectures on a limited number of imaging topics, focused mostly on abdominal imaging, which related to the interests of the faculty leading the tutorials. These were presented exclusively to the first-year residents during the first month of training, as a supplement to the remaining standard teaching conferences built into their schedule. The Education Committee recognized this abbreviated lecture series as an underdeveloped opportunity to provide incoming residents with a more comprehensive introduction to the field of diagnostic radiology and to ensure all new residents shared the same fund of knowledge required in the beginning of their residency training. Further, the subjects of professionalism and safety issues in diagnostic imaging, which are core requirements of any training program sponsored by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, had not been formally taught to first-year residents prior to 2010. Given the new Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–outlined Milestones intended to ascertain an individual’s progress through residency training, a course designed specifically for the needs of new radiology residents has useful potential for addressing all areas of competency.
