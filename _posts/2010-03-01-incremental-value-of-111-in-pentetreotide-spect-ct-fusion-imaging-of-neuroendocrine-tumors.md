## Rationale and Objectives

Hybrid single photon-emission computed tomographic (SPECT) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging for the investigation of neuroendocrine tumors allows the fusion of functional and anatomic information in a rapid and efficient method. The aim of this study was to assess the incremental diagnostic value of  111 In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging compared with traditional planar and SPECT imaging with respect to lesion localization and characterization and reader confidence.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-nine patients (23 male, 26 female; mean age, 56.9 years; range, 14–88 years) who underwent  111 In pentetreotide planar, SPECT, and SPECT/CT imaging were eligible for this retrospective study, including patients with suspected or confirmed carcinoid tumors ( _n_ = 24), endocrine pancreatic tumors ( _n_ = 18), medullary thyroid cancer ( _n_ = 3), paragangliomas ( _n_ = 2), and multiple endocrine neoplasia type I ( _n_ = 2). Planar and SPECT images were reviewed by two blinded readers, followed by interpretation using additional SPECT/CT images in a subsequent session. A third reader provided consensus in cases with disagreements.

## Results

In 55 of 89 lesions (61.8%),  111 In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging improved lesion localization compared to planar and SPECT imaging; in 25 of 89 lesions (28.1%), SPECT/CT imaging changed lesion classification. In 20 of 49 patients (40.8%) for reader 1 and 14 of 49 patients (28.6%) for reader 2,  111 In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging provided incremental diagnostic value, which was considered likely to affect patient management in twelve of 20 and seven of 14 patients, respectively. Increased reader confidence was found in 32 of 49 patients (65.3%) for both readers with uniformly high confidence after SPECT/CT interpretation.

## Conclusions

Hybrid  111 In pentetreotide SPECT/CT imaging provides incremental diagnostic value and greater reader confidence over planar and SPECT imaging. This is achieved though superior lesion localization, the identification of physiologic activity, and additional anatomic information derived from the nondiagnostic CT portion of the study.

Since its introduction almost two decades ago, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has become the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), taking advantage of the overexpression of somatostatin receptors at the cell membrane by this group of neoplasms, to allow imaging with radiolabeled peptide somatostatin analogues . Hybrid single photon-emission computed tomographic (SPECT) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging, also referred to as transmission emission tomography or functional anatomic mapping, is a novel technology that combines functional and structural information in a rapid and efficient method, using integrated gamma cameras with inline CT scanners.

A recent review found evidence for superiority of SPECT/CT imaging over the current standard (planar and SPECT) imaging in bone, somatostatin receptor, parathyroid, and adrenal scintigraphy, although it was commented that there are limited clinical studies at present . The improvement in the diagnostic performance of somatostatin receptor scintigraphic (SRS) SPECT/CT imaging derives from superior anatomic localization of activity (and therefore lesion characterization) and the application of a CT algorithm to correct for photon attenuation in SPECT images . The CT component is usually nondiagnostic in quality (reduced tube current), without contrast enhancement, although the CT images may still provide useful structural information. The additional radiation exposure from the low-dose CT imaging is approximated at 2 to 4 mSv, depending on the field of view . Image acquisition of both components occurs with the patient in the same bed position. Coregistration of both tomographic sets is immediate and more precise (because of reduced patient movement) compared to software methods of image coregistration or side-by-side viewing of functional and structural information.
