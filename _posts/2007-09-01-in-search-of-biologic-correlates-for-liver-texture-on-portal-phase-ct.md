## Rationale and Objectives

The acceptance of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) in clinical practice has been constrained by the scarcity of identifiable biologic correlates for CAD-based image parameters. This study aims to identify biologic correlates for computed tomography (CT) liver texture in a series of patients with colorectal cancer.

## Materials and Methods

In 28 patients with colorectal cancer, total hepatic perfusion (THP), hepatic arterial perfusion, and hepatic portal perfusion (HPP) were measured using perfusion CT. Hepatic glucose use was also determined from positron emission tomography (PET) and expressed as standardized uptake value (SUV). A hepatic phosphorylation fraction index (HPFI) was determined from both SUV and THP. These physiologic parameters were correlated with CAD parameters namely hepatic densitometry, selective-scale, and relative-scale texture features in apparently normal areas of portal-phase hepatic CT.

## Results

For patients without liver metastases, a relative-scale texture parameter correlated inversely with SUV ( _r_ = −0.587, _P_ = .007) and, positively with THP ( _r_ = 0.512, _P_ = .021) and HPP ( _r_ = 0.451, _P_ = .046). However, this relative texture parameter correlated most significantly with HPFI ( _r_ = −0.590, _P_ = .006). For patients with liver metastases, although not significant an opposite trend was observed between these physiologic parameters and relative texture features (THP: _r_ < −0.4, HPFI: _r_ \> 0.35).

## Conclusion

Total hepatic blood flow and glucose metabolism are two distinct but related biologic correlates for liver texture on portal phase CT, providing a rationale for the use of hepatic texture analysis as a indicator for patients with colorectal cancer.

Radiologists’ assessment of diagnostic images is largely based on evaluating morphologic information such as size and shape and the human visual system has difficulties in discriminating textural information such as coarseness and regularity that result from local spatial variations in image brightness ( ). Also, image perception and identifying relationships between perceived patterns and possible diagnosis heavily depend on radiologist’s knowledge, memory, intuition, and diligence. The use of texture analysis in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of radiologic images has therefore attracted a lot of interest. Texture is a rich source of visual information and a key component in image analysis and understanding in humans ( ), with evidence showing texture mechanisms and discrimination to be beneficial in perceptual learning ( ). Algorithmic processing as against visual analysis is becoming increasingly important for deriving quantitative textural information from images.

Although there seems to be a great potential for texture analysis as a CAD technique in medical imaging, very few of these techniques have actually been put into clinical practice. One of the few commercialized applications of image processing that has withstood thorough testing and gained approval from the US Food and Drug Administration is Image Checker M1000 (R2 Technology, Los Altos, CA) for screening mammograms. One potential reason constraining the acceptance of CAD despite demonstrable improvements in diagnostic performance in many cases may be a paucity of identifiable biologic correlates for the image parameters underlying the CAD. Whereas tissue microcalcification is a likely correlate for mammographic computer analysis, the correlates for other organs may be less clear. The identification of biologic correlates is further impaired when there are difficulties in obtaining tissue for histologic analysis from the invasive nature of biopsy in some organs—for instance, the brain or liver. In these circumstances, physiologic correlates such as those provided by functional imaging techniques may be more appropriate than pathologic features.

The FDG-PET based standardized uptake value of glucose in the liver was used as a surrogate for the net influx constant (K  1 ) and computed tomography perfusion measurements of combined arterial and portal perfusion as a surrogate for K  1 ( ). Thus an index of hepatic phosphorylation was obtained by the ratio of standardized uptake value and THP.

where (x, y) are the spatial coordinates of the image matrix and sigma, σ, is the standard deviation. The 2D Gaussian distribution effectively blurs the image, wiping out all structures at scales much smaller than the sigma of the Gaussian. This distribution has the desirable characteristics of being smooth and localized in both the spatial and frequency domains and is therefore less likely to introduce any changes that were not present in the original image. Thus the Gaussian distribution enables the highlighting of only hepatic textural features of a particular scale in contrast-agent enhanced CT images corresponding to a particular σ value. We have employed this filtration technique to filter out textural features of varying scale; fine scale enhances parenchyma whereas medium to coarse scale enhances blood vessels.

From the mathematical expression of this circularly symmetric filter at different σ values, the number of pixels representing the width between the diametrically opposite zero-crossing points in this filter can be calculated (see  Fig 5 ). The width of the filter at different σ values are obtained by evaluating the LoG spatial distribution along the x and y directions (  Table 4 ). The width can be considered as the scale at which the structures in the image will be highlighted and enhanced, whereas structures below this scale will become blurred (  Fig 1 ). The lower the sigma value, the smaller is the width of the filter in the spatial domain and the larger is the pass-band region of the filter in the frequency domain, highlighting fine details or features in the filtered image in the spatial domain. Similarly, the higher the sigma value, the higher is the width of the filter in the spatial domain; this corresponds to a smaller pass-band region of the filter in the frequency domain, highlighting coarse features in the filtered image in the spatial domain.

Besides the use of filtered fine, medium, and coarse mean gray-level intensity quantification, normalized fine, medium, and coarse mean gray-level intensities were also quantified. Normalization was done primarily to minimize the effects of the variation in CT attenuation values occurring from one patient to another and reducing the effect of noise on texture quantification. Mean gray-level intensity and uniformity for fine, medium, and coarse textures were normalized with respect to the largest observed liver texture feature highlighted by the filter (σ = 2.5, width = 12 pixels or 10.08 mm) in our study.
