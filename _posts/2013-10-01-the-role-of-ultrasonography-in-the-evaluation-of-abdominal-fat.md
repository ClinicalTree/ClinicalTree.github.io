## Rationale and Objectives

Ultrasonography (US) is becoming popular for the assessment of adiposity, but no one has studied this tool in the light of its potential limitations. Our purpose was to investigate the impact of technical conditions on the evaluation of abdominal fat by US.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-five healthy males and 45 healthy females were consecutively enrolled in the study, randomly assigned to three groups equally distributed by sex, and examined accordingly to three technical points: fasting state (before and after meal \[A\]), breathing (expiration and inspiration \[B\]), and US equipment from different generations: 2003 and 1998 (C). Two blinded radiologists performed US in the these opposite conditions, acquiring five parameters representative of subcutaneous and visceral adiposity in two times. Student's _t_ -test and Lin's correlation coefficient were used for statistical analysis to assess differences in the measures as well as in inter- and intra-observer agreements.

## Results

The maximum and the only statistically significant changes were observed for intra-abdominal fat thickness regarding fasting state and breathing (Δ% = 24.1 ± 21.3 and Δ% = 9.2 ± 20.4, respectively; _P_ < .0001). Reproducibility and repeatability, especially for visceral fat, were proved more stable in the following conditions: fasting state, expiration, and newer machine (2003).

## Conclusion

This article provides essential information and “range of confidence” for variations that can be expected from using different conditions in the measurement of abdominal adiposity by US to be carefully addressed as well as considered by US users and by researchers involving this technique in the field of body composition.

Adipose tissue is one of the most enigmatic components of the body. Evaluation and quantification of adipose tissue are fundamental in the field of body composition as well as body composition is crucial for understanding human and animal metabolism and its alterations .

Imaging has been essential in bringing body composition analysis to a clinical ground. In clinical practice, one of the most used techniques to assess the organ-tissue level of body composition is ultrasonography (US). This technique has demonstrated satisfying results in terms of accuracy and reproducibility .
