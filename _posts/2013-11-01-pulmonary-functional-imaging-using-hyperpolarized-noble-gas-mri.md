## Rationale and Objectives

In this review, we summarize our experience evaluating pulmonary function in 330 different subjects using hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after enrollment and screening of >1100 subjects with and without respiratory disease during the period February 1, 2006, through November 1, 2012.

## Materials and Methods

We discuss the feasibility of hyperpolarized gas MRI research in a small nonhospital research unit and provide an overview of our experience since we initiated patient-based studies. We also discuss the importance of infrastructure support, collaboration, research trainees, and a large and willing patient population that helped to advance the research and technological deliverables. A summary of patient safety and tolerability, key feasibility, and research milestones is provided, as well as a roadmap for future studies.

## Results

Hyperpolarized  3 He and  129 Xe gas MRI is feasible at smaller centers without significant human resources for large and small longitudinal studies by virtue of its excellent patient safety and tolerability, the speed with which images can be acquired and quantitatively analyzed and the high spatial-temporal dynamics of the method that allows for acute and chronic therapy studies.

## Conclusions

The hyperpolarized noble gas MRI community's highly collaborative efforts and motivation to further the development and application of this tool has resulted in a moment-of-opportunity to translate the method clinically to provide an improved understanding of pulmonary disease. There are, as well, new and unprecedented opportunities for the evaluation of disease progression and to help develop the new treatments and interventions critically required for chronic pulmonary disease.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was developed as a research and diagnostic imaging tool to provide unique tissue contrast with high spatial and temporal resolution. In contrast to other diagnostic imaging methods, MRI does not require the use of x-rays or other ionizing radiation, offering the potential for intensive serial and longitudinal studies in the same patient, in children, and in radiation-sensitive tissues. However, despite these very practical advantages, MRI of the lung provides a unique challenge due to the low signal from the lung parenchyma because of the low proton (  1 H) density (versus high gas density) in the lung, as well as the effects of motion, magnetic susceptibility, and the multiexponential T2 relaxation times .

With the understanding that image contrast in conventional  1 H MRI depends on the  1 H density of the tissue as well as the magnetic environment of the protons within that tissue, a number of MRI methods can be used for lung imaging, including ultra-short echo time (UTE) methods and Fourier decomposition .  1 H MRI contrast agents including oxygen-enhanced MRI have also been developed and demonstrated to provide novel regional, morphological, and functional measurements in respiratory disease .

![Figure 6, Quantifying hyperpolarized 3 He MRI using visual scoring, manual segmentation and semi-automated segmentation for an asthma subject. Visual scoring is performed by counting the number of ventilation defects for all 3 He image slices. A ventilation defect is defined as any well-defined area of the lung showing no or low signal intensity compared with the remaining ventilated lung, but not associated with the pulmonary vascular structures, heart, hilum and mediastinum. Manual segmentation of the ventilation defects is performed using custom-designed three-dimensional image visualization software that provides a method for two-dimensional rigid image registration of the 1 H and 3 He MRI images for manual delineation of the ventilation defect boundaries. Semi-automated segmentation of the ventilation defects is performed using custom-designed image segmentation/registration software that clusters of the 3 He image into 5 clusters where cluster 1 (C1) represents the ventilation defect regions, and cluster 2 to 5 (C2-C5) represent gradations of signal intensity.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/PulmonaryFunctionalImagingUsingHyperpolarizedNobleGasMRI/4_1s20S1076633213003887.jpg)
