## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiac computed tomographic (CT) scans for the assessment of coronary calcium scores include approximately 70% of the lung volume and may be useful for the quantitative assessment of emphysema. The reproducibility of lung density measures from cardiac computed tomography and their validity compared to lung density measures from full-lung scans is unknown.

## Materials and Methods

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) performed paired cardiac CT scans for 6814 participants at baseline and at follow-up. The MESA-Lung Study assessed lung density measures in the lung fields of these cardiac scans, counting voxels below −910 HU as moderate-to-severe emphysema-like lung regions. We evaluated: 1) the reproducibility of lung density measures among 120 randomly selected participants; 2) the comparability of measures acquired on electron beam CT (EBCT) and multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners among 10 participants; and 3) the validity of these measures compared to full-lung scans among 42 participants. Limits of agreement were determined using Bland-Altman approaches.

## Results

Percent emphysema measures from paired cardiac scans were highly correlated ( _r_ = 0.92–0.95) with mean difference of −0.05% (95% limits of agreement: −8.3, 8.4%). Measures from EBCT and MDCT scanners were comparable (mean difference −0.9%; 95% limits of agreement: −5.1, 3.3%). Percent emphysema measures from MDCT cardiac and MDCT full-lung scans were highly correlated ( _r_ = 0.93) and demonstrated reasonable agreement (mean difference 2.2%; 95% limits of agreement: −9.2, 13.8%).

## Conclusions

Although full-lung imaging is preferred for the quantification of emphysema, the lung imaging from paired cardiac computed tomography provided a reproducible and valid quantitative assessment of emphysema in a population-based sample.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Morbidity and mortality from COPD continue to rise—in contrast to declines in mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and stroke . COPD is defined by airflow obstruction on post-bronchodilator spirometry testing; however, millions of Americans have symptomatic COPD that is undiagnosed because of difficulties with access, testing, and interpretation of spirometry . Emphysema is defined by a loss of lung tissue in the absence of fibrosis and overlaps considerably with COPD. Emphysema can be quantitated on full-lung computed tomographic (CT) scans by various measures of CT lung density , which provide supplemental information to spirometry .

Cardiac CT scans for the assessment of coronary calcium scores can be obtained rapidly with low radiation exposure . Coronary calcium scores strongly predict near-term risk of coronary heart disease independent of established risk factors . Cardiac CT scans might provide an opportunity for the assessment of emphysema because they image about 70% of the lung volume (approximately the carina to T11). Cardiac CT scans differ, however, from full-lung CT scans that are performed for lung density measurements not just by the volume of the lung imaged but also by coaching of the patient to full inspiration, cardiac gating, and the image acquisition protocol itself. It is therefore uncertain if lung density measures from cardiac scans are reproducible and valid measures of full-lung emphysema.
