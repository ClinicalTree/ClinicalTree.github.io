To The Editor:

We read with great interest the article by Pei and Xie in the January 2009 issue of _Academic Radiology_ . The authors suggest evaluating patients with chronic kidney disease using gadolinium-enhanced perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. In their study, the authors used gadolinium diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA). Pei and Xie state in the introduction that “Gd-DTPA is not contraindicated in patients with impaired renal function , and it is therefore possible to study renal perfusion and excretion in patients with chronic renal dysfunction using dynamic MRI.” The quoted source, by Haustein et al , focuses on the evolution of serum creatinine level in the 5 days after gadolinium injection. It is worth noting that this study was published in 1992, 14 years before the discovery of a possible link between gadolinium injection and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis . Today, Gd-DTPA is known to be one of the gadolinium contrast agents that may induce nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Furthermore, chronic kidney disease is known to be a major risk factor for this very severe disease, whose first signs may occur as late as 3 months after the injection.

Guidelines from the European Society of Uroradiology recommend avoiding the use of Gd-DTPA, gadodiamide, and gadoversetamide in at-risk patients. In patients with chronic kidney disease, other gadolinium contrast agents, preferably cyclic, must be used, at the lowest dose possible to achieve a diagnostic examination.

At the beginning of MR renography, Gd-DTPA was the most commonly used gadolinium contrast agent, under the assumption that it would have similar pharmacokinetics as  99m Technetium-DTPA. However, it has been recently proved that Gd-DTPA is filtered much faster than  99m Technetium-DTPA .

Furthermore, several studies have shown the advantages and the feasibility of MR renography with low doses of gadolinium contrast agents (0.025 mmol/L or 2–4 mL) in adults. These doses help avoid the susceptibility effects associated with high concentrations of gadolinium contrast agents in the renal medulla and collecting system.

In our opinion, the choice of Gd-DTPA and the rationale for a 20-mL injection should be more discussed.
