## Purpose

To evaluate interobserver agreement in regard to measurements of focal ground-glass opacities (GGO) diameters on computed tomography (CT) images to identify increases in the size of GGOs.

## Materials and Methods

Approval by the institutional review board and informed consent by the patients were obtained. Ten GGOs (mean size, 10.4 mm; range, 6.5–15 mm), one each in 10 patients (mean age, 65.9 years; range, 58–78 years), were used to make the diameter measurements. Eleven radiologists independently measured the diameters of the GGOs on a total of 40 thin-section CT images (the first \[n = 10\], the second \[n = 10\], and the third \[n = 10\] follow-up CT examinations and remeasurement of the first \[n = 10\] follow-up CT examinations) without comparing time-lapse CT images. Interobserver agreement was assessed by means of Bland-Altman plots.

## Results

The smallest range of the 95% limits of interobserver agreement between the members of the 55 pairs of the 11 radiologists in regard to maximal diameter was −1.14 to 1.72 mm, and the largest range was −7.7 to 1.7 mm. The mean value of the lower limit of the 95% limits of agreement was −3.1 ± 1.4 mm, and the mean value of their upper limit was 2.5 ± 1.1 mm.

## Conclusion

When measurements are made by any two radiologists, an increase in the length of the maximal diameter of more than 1.72 mm would be necessary in order to be able to state that the maximal diameter of a particular GGO had actually increased.

Since the advent of multislice computed tomography (CT) technologies and the widespread use of CT scanning of the chest for CT lung cancer screening as well as for clinical purposes, increasing numbers of focal ground-glass opacities (GGOs) are being detected . GGOs are defined as focal nodular areas of increased lung attenuation through which normal parenchymal structures such as airways, vessels, and interlobular septa can be seen . Most persistent GGOs are assumed to be pulmonary neoplasms . Although several computer-assisted volumetry studies of GGOs have been reported , measurement of GGO diameters on thin-section CT (TS-CT) images is a simple method of evaluating the size of GGOs in clinical practice. However, measurements of pulmonary nodules on TS-CT images have been found to vary with the radiologists . To our knowledge, no assessment of interobserver agreement in regard to diameter measurements of GGOs on TS-CT images and causes of its variability has ever been performed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate interobserver agreement in regard to measurements of GGO diameters on TS-CT images as a means of identifying increases in the size of GGOs.

The numbers in the first row represent the numbers of observers who selected each CT slice during the first reading of the thin-section CT images from the first follow-up CT examination (Group 1). The numbers in the second row represent the numbers of observers who selected each CT slice during the second reading of the thin-section CT images from the first follow-up CT examination (Group 4). The alphabets within the parentheses indicate the respective observers. At the second reading, only four (Drs. D, E, G, and H) of the 11 observers selected the same CT slice as that selected at the first reading, while the others selected CT slices that were different from the CT slices selected at the first reading.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MeasurementofFocalGroundglassOpacityDiametersonCTImages/2_1s20S107663321100599X.jpg)
