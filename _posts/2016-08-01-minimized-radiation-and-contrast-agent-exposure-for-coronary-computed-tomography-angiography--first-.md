## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of the latest coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) techniques allowing a radiation- and contrast-sparing protocol on image quality in unselected patients referred for exclusion of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

## Materials and Methods

This prospective study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients provided written informed consent. Between March and June 2015, 89 consecutive patients (61% male; mean age 55 ± 11 years) referred for exclusion of CAD by 256-slice CCTA using prospective electrocardiogram triggering were included. Tube voltage (80–120 kVp), tube current (180–310 mA) as well contrast agent volume (25–45 mL) and flow rate (3.5–5 mL/s) were adapted to body mass index. Signal intensity was measured by placing a region of interest in the aortic root, the left main artery, and the proximal right coronary artery. Image noise was measured in the aortic root. Two independent blinded readers semi-quantitatively assessed the image quality regarding motion, noise, and contrast on a 4-point scale.

## Results

Median contrast agent volume and median effective radiation dose were 35 mL (interquartile range, 30–40 mL) and 0.5 mSv (interquartile range, 0.4–0.6 mSv), respectively. Mean attenuation in the aortic root was 412 ± 89 Hounsfield units. Diagnostic image quality was obtained in 1050 of 1067 (98.4%) coronary segments and, on an intention-to-diagnosis basis, in 85 of 89 (95.5%) patients. Below a cut-off heart rate of 67 beats/min, only 1 of 974 (0.1%) coronary segments was nondiagnostic.

## Conclusion

A radiation- and contrast-sparing protocol for CCTA on a latest generation 256-slice computed tomography scanner yields diagnostic image quality in patients referred for CAD exclusion in daily clinical routine.

## Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) has become an important and robust noninvasive imaging tool for the exclusion of significant coronary artery disease (CAD). However, its growing clinical use has raised concerns about the potential induction of malignancies due to the increased burden of radiation exposure for patients . Furthermore, the debate on the potential risks associated with cardiovascular imaging has recently been extended to additional components, and contrast agents have been identified as significant contributors of potential risk. In fact, the rate of death and serious acute adverse events due to contrast agent exposure is not negligible and outweighs the radiation-related risks . As a consequence, various technological advances have evolved not only to reduce radiation exposure , but also to save contrast agent volume , potentially enabling a CCTA imaging approach with a combined low radiation and low contrast agent volume exposure.

The introduction of prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering , including its adaption to high-pitch helical scanning , has paved the way for a substantial reduction of radiation exposure from initially over 20 mSv with conventional helical acquisition to approximately 2 mSv in current daily clinical routine . Nevertheless, prospective triggering is prone to image quality degradation if the patient's heart rate is irregular or high (ie >62 beats/min at a gantry rotation time of 350 ms) . Wide-volume 256-slice scanners with 16-cm cranial-caudal coverage and fast gantry rotation time of 280 ms permit acquisition of the whole heart within a single heartbeat, which not only eliminates misalignment artifacts , but also results in decreased radiation dose by precluding redundant radiation from overlapping of sequential axial scans and allows for a reduction of contrast agent volume because of shorter acquisition time . Furthermore, a more powerful X-ray generator enables acquisition at tube voltages of 100 kVp or below, thereby offering a further reduction of radiation dose, while yielding higher contrast than the standard 120 kVp technique because the X-ray output energy is closer to the iodine K-edge of 33 keV .
