## Rationale and Objectives

To optimize visualization of lenticulostriate artery (LSA) by time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with slice-selective off-resonance sinc (SORS) saturation transfer contrast pulses and to compare capability of optimal TOF-MRA and flow-sensitive black-blood (FSBB) MRA to visualize the LSA at 3T.

## Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the local ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects. TOF-MRA was optimized in 20 subjects by comparing SORS pulses of different flip angles: 0, 400°, and 750°. Numbers of LSAs were counted. The optimal TOF-MRA was compared to FSBB-MRA in 21 subjects. Images were evaluated by the numbers and length of visualized LSAs.

## Results

LSAs were significantly more visualized in TOF-MRA with SORS pulses of 400° than others ( _P_ < .003). When the optimal TOF-MRA was compared to FSBB-MRA, the visualization of LSA using FSBB (mean branch numbers 11.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 10.0–12.1; mean total length 236 mm, 95% CI 210–263 mm) was significantly better than using TOF (4.7, 95% CI 4.1–5.3; 78 mm, 95% CI 67–89 mm) for both numbers and length of the LSA ( _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

LSA visualization was best with 400° SORS pulses for TOF-MRA but FSBB-MRA was better than TOF-MRA, which indicates its clinical potential to investigate the LSA on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging.

Impairment of the lenticulostriate artery (LSA) often leads to lacunar infarction and cerebral hemorrhage, which is recognized as ‘ _small vessels, big problems_ .’ The LSA branches supply blood to the basal ganglia and its vicinity , and their occlusion results in infarction of these structures . Recently, LSA branches have successfully been visualized using 7T and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems with three-dimensional (3D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Whereas at 1.5T, a recent study reported that flow-sensitive black blood (FSBB) MRA, which decreases blood flow signal with weak motion-dephasing gradient, performed better than TOF-MRA for visualization of the LSA . Moreover, FSBB-MRA at 1.5T could detect differences in the LSA between patients with lacunar infarction and/or hypertension and control subjects . However, at 3T, there is no study so far that has compared LSA visualization using TOF-MRA to FSBB-MRA.

In TOF-MRA acquisition, the saturation transfer contrast pulse is often used to reduce background signal, but the blood signal is also reduced, although the blood to background contrast is usually increased. To less reduce the blood signal, slice-selective off-resonance sinc (SORS) pulse can be applied, and enhanced visualization of LSA branches at 1.5T has been achieved .
