Imaging of the fetus, neonatal, and infant brains with magnetic resonance (MR) is increasingly common, particularly outside the confines of the larger pediatric referral centers. A large percentage of these patients are imaged for potential neurological abnormalities. With this increased rate of imaging comes an increased need to understand the dynamic nature and subsequent MR appearance of fetal and neonatal brains. The _Atlas of Fetal and Postnatal Brain MR_ is an excellent reference for rapidly determining the normal anatomy and myelination pattern expected for the fetus and infant.

The _Atlas_ is laid out in a user-friendly and sensible manner. The first section is devoted to gross photographs of postmortem brains. Images are presented in the lateral, superior, inferior, and midline projections from brains of varying gestational ages. All of the major sulci and gyri are labeled in detail, and there is an excellent, concise introductory chapter discussing maturation and sulcation of the fetal brain.

The remainder and the bulk of the _Atlas_ is devoted to the cross-sectional appearance of the fetal and infant brain. For the fetal images, six different gestational age ranges are demonstrated, beginning at 19–20 weeks and ending with 36–37 weeks. Axial, coronal, and sagittal in utero MR images are provided for each of the gestational ages. These are accompanied by detailed line diagrams of the major structures visible on the images.

In addition to the in utero MR images and diagrams, the _Atlas_ also provides photographic images of thin cut postmortem tissue sections of the brain. These are well-matched with the in utero MR images and were the basis for the line diagrams. These sections provide exquisite detail of the anatomic structures and are a valuable addition.

Finally, postmortem MR images of the brain are also provided at each of the ages and planes of section. Contrast and spatial resolution are much better than the in utero images, because the postmortem views could be obtained without concern for motion artifact or the necessary long acquisition times. These represent the currently unobtainable “ideal” MR images, showing the details at each level of section.

The postnatal brain images are the third section of the book. As with the fetal images, a line diagram detailing the anatomy is provided for each section. There are no postmortem images in this section. Rather, spin echo T1 and fast spin echo T2 images are provided. As the sulcation pattern is fully developed at term, the primary value of this section is the delineation of myelination at various ages. Images are provided from birth to 18 months. Detail is excellent.
