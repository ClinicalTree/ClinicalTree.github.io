“Asymmetry Analysis in Rodent Cerebral Ischemia Models.” Acad Radiol 2008; 15:1181–1197.

In the section “Materials and Methods” (pp 1183–1187), the included mathematics closely parallels the development in the unpublished manuscript “Further Techniques for Enhancing Asymmetry in Brain Imagery,” by X. Liu, C. Imielinska, and J. Rosiene (2005), without reference to the prior work. The authors regret the omission.
