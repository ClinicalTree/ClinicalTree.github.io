In an era of value-based medicine, data-driven quality improvement is more important than ever to ensure safe and efficient imaging services. Familiarity with high-value tools enables all radiologists to successfully engage in quality and efficiency improvement. In this article, we review the model for improvement, strategies for measurement, and common practical tools with real-life examples that include Run chart, Control chart (Shewhart chart), Fishbone (Cause-and-Effect or Ishikawa) diagram, Pareto chart, 5 Whys, and Root Cause Analysis.

## Introduction

In Radiology, quality improvement is the constant effort to improve performance, safety, and patient outcomes based on imaging services . Diagnostic imaging and image-guided procedures require a complex system of information, equipment, personnel, and decision-making that must be well integrated to provide patient care effectively and safely. Appropriate intervention at points of inefficiency or potential hazard can reduce costs and benefit patient care. Involving departmental and hospital leadership is essential to establish an organizational commitment to support these activities . Understanding the model for improvement, strategies for measurement, and practical quality improvement tools enables every radiologist to successfully engage in quality and efficiency improvement.

## The Model for Improvement

Quality improvement is most effective when it is systematic, data-driven, continuous, and incorporated as a _core responsibility_ of health-care professionals. It should employ a formal methodology and focus on system change. In contrast, informal improvement efforts are frequently sporadic, anecdotal, rarely data-driven, and implemented without an assigned responsible supervisor. Such patchwork improvements are challenging to integrate into a cohesive system and may lead to future inefficiencies, not initially anticipated.

The “Model for Improvement,” as outlined by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement, emphasizes project aims, designing measurements around the aims, and then testing small changes before enterprise-wide implementation. The process is then continued in a cycle of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) (  Table 1 ) .

TABLE 1


The Model for Improvement Specifies Aims, followed by Measurements Needed to Track Progress Toward the Specified Aims, and then Specific Ideas That Will Enable Us to Accomplish Our Aims


Aims What are we trying to accomplish?

- State clear objectives—know exactly what you are trying to do


Measurements How will we know that a change is an improvement?

- Measure processes and outcomes


Change ideas What change can we make that will result in improvement?

![Figure 1, More data is not always better. In this example, a sample size of 10 did not clearly show the trend. When the sample size is increased to 30, a clear trend is seen (decreasing CT radiation exposure after an intervention was implemented in May). Further increasing the sample size from 30 to 50 or from 30 to 100 does not alter interpretation of the trend. Finding a balance that enables interpretation of trends while minimizing administrative burdens of data collection is essential for quality improvement.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/QualityandEfficiencyImprovementToolsforEveryRadiologist/0_1s20S1076633218300722.jpg)

The subsequent data point below the lower control limit ( red circle ) and two continuous data points within the outer third of the control limit ( orange circle ) indicate that the intervention had real impact. New mean and control limits illustrate the adjusted baseline, which has decreased by 24%. The new tighter control limits indicate more predictable performance. Monitoring to keep data within these new limits ensures the new baseline performance is sustained.
