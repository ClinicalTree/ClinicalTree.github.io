## Rationale and Objectives

Breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scanning protocols vary widely. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of postcontrast timing on delayed-phase lesion kinetics assessment and ability to discriminate malignant from benign lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Following institutional review board approval, we retrospectively reviewed all lesions assessed on magnetic resonance examinations from April 2005 to June 2006. DCE-MRI was performed with 90-second temporal resolution. Delayed-phase kinetic parameters including percentages of persistent, plateau, and washout, and categorizations of predominant and worst curve type were compared between 4.5 and 7.5 minutes postcontrast. Ability to discriminate benign and malignant lesions based on delayed-phase kinetic parameters was compared between postcontrast timings by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

## Results

Two hundred eighty consecutive breast lesions (206 malignant and 74 benign) were evaluated in 228 women. Comparing kinetics assessments at 7.5 versus 4.5 minutes: volume percentage of washout increased in malignancies by a mean of 9.4% ( _P_ < .0001) and increased slightly in benign lesions (mean 3.2%, _P_ = .007); predominant curve type categorizations changed significantly only for malignancies ( _P_ < .0001); and worst curve categorizations did not change significantly for either benign or malignant lesions ( _P_ > .05). There were no significant differences between timings in area under ROC curves for delayed-phase kinetic parameters.

## Conclusions

The choice of delayed postcontrast timing more strongly affects the kinetics assessments for malignancies than benign breast lesions, but our results suggest that a shortened breast DCE-MRI protocol may not significantly impact diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, worst curve type classifications are least affected by postcontrast timing and may provide reliable assessment of delayed-phase kinetics across protocols.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an important tool for screening high-risk women, evaluating extent of disease in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer, and monitoring breast tumors during neoadjuvant treatment . DCE-MRI provides sensitive and moderately specific characterization of breast lesions when used in conjunction with the American College of Radiology (ACR) MRI Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon to assess lesion morphology and initial and delayed enhancement patterns . In addition to established diagnostic morphologic features such as margin and distribution , DCE-MRI enhancement kinetics has been reported to improve delineation between benign and malignant lesions in multiple studies .

The shape of the time–signal intensity curve is an important measure in characterizing enhancing lesions , and computer-aided evaluation of enhancement kinetics improves diagnostic accuracy . For standardized reporting and as recommended by the ACR BI-RADS lexicon, enhancement of breast lesions is defined by initial-phase and delayed-phase enhancement. Initial-phase enhancement is classified as slow, medium, or rapid depending on the slope of the line from time zero (at the time of contrast injection) to the peak enhancement within the first 2 minutes. Delayed enhancement is classified as persistent (increasing), plateau (stable), or washout (decreasing) curve types . In general, a washout curve has been shown to be a strong independent predictor of malignancy in prior studies, with Kuhl et al. reporting cancer in 87% of lesions with any washout and Schnall et al. identifying malignancy in 76% of such lesions .

The first postcontrast scan was begun 45 seconds after initiation of contrast injection to center k space at 1.5 minutes postcontrast. Precontrast, initial, and delayed contrast-enhanced scans were incorporated into computer-aided evaluation software with centering of k space 1.5 minutes and either 4.5 or 7.5 minutes after contrast injection.
