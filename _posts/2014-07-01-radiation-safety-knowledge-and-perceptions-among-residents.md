## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate residents' knowledge of adverse effects of ionizing radiation, frequency of their education on radiation safety, and their use of radioprotective equipment.

## Materials and Methods

Residents from 15/16 residency programs at Emory University were asked to complete a resident radiation safety survey through SurveyMonkey  ® . The associations between the residents' knowledge and use of radioprotective equipment with residents' specialty and year of training were investigated.

## Results

Response rate was 32.5% (173/532 residents). Thirty-nine percent residents reported radiation safety is discussed in their residency curriculum at least every 6 months. Ninety-five percent believed in a link between radiation exposure and development of cancer. Overall and Radiology residents' knowledge about specific estimated dose effects (correct responses) was limited: radiation dose associated with fetus brain malformation in pregnancy (10% vs. 26%), risk of developing cataract in interventional personnel (27% vs. 47%), lifetime risk of cancer mortality from a single abdominal computed tomography (CT) in children (22% vs. 29%), greater radiosensitivity of children compared to adults (35% vs. 50%), and relative radiation dose from an abdominal CT compared to a chest x-ray (51% vs. 48%). Radiology residents had modestly higher knowledge. There was no significant difference in residents' knowledge across their postgraduate training years. Use of lead thyroid shields was reported by 86% (97% radiology vs. 80% nonradiology; _P_ = .03) and radiation-monitoring badges in 39% (68% radiology vs. 15% nonradiology; _P_ < .001) of the residents.

## Conclusions

Although radiology residents scored higher, knowledge of radiation safety for patients and healthcare workers is limited among residents regardless of medical specialty. These findings emphasize the need for educational initiatives.

The National Council for Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP) performs periodic surveys of radiation exposure from all sources to the American population. Their most recent survey reported that there is a rapid increase in average exposure to the American population from medical imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT) and cardiac nuclear medicine testing, from 15% in the early 1980s to 48% in 2006 . Effective dose is a risk estimate for a patient population from radiation exposure and is expressed in Sieverts (Sv) . The risk that a radiation dose will induce a cancer in a specific organ changes with age, gender, and individual patients' variations of intrinsic radiation sensitivity. The population baseline lifetime cancer risk is 25%. For every 100 mSv of radiation dose to an average population, lifetime cancer mortality risk increases from 25% to 25.5% . The relationship between radiation dose and cancer risk is highly controversial; however, the scientific community generally assumes that there is no safe threshold at low dose (the linear no-threshold model) . There is growing public concern that low-dose (<100 mSv) ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging may be associated with increased cancer risk depending on radiation dose and duration of exposure. Extrapolating from data of the Life Span Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors, Brenner and Hall estimated that up to 2% of future cancers may be attributable to CT scanning.

The potential for cancer induction associated with medical radiation is even more important in children and pregnant women. The younger a patient, the more radiosensitive they are for certain tumors . They also have a greater postradiation exposure life expectancy compared to adults in which to manifest radiation-induced tumors .
