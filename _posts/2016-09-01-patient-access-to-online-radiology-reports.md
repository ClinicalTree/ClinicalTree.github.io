## Rationale and Objectives

Our objective was to evaluate the frequency with which patients viewed their online radiology reports in relation to clinical and laboratory notes and identify sociodemographic factors associated with report viewing.

## Method and Materials

We conducted a cross-sectional study of 129,419 patients who had online patient portal access in our large health system in 2014. We determined whether patients viewed their radiology reports, laboratory reports, and clinical notes. We also collected patient sociodemographic information including gender, age, primary spoken language, race/ethnicity, and insurance status. We performed multivariate analyses to determine significant associations between viewing of radiology reports and viewing of other types of clinical reports and patient characteristics.

## Results

Of 61,131 patients with at least one radiology report available, 31,308 (51.2%) viewed them. Patients who also viewed laboratory reports or clinical notes were significantly more likely to view their radiology reports ( _P_ < 0.001). Women (56.2%), patients 25–39 years old (59.5%), and English speakers (53.6%) were most likely to view radiology reports. In multivariate analysis, Asian-Americans were more likely and African-Americans were less likely to view their radiology reports compared to whites (OR = 1.07 and OR = 0.39, respectively; _P_ < 0.001 for both). Patients with Medicaid were less likely to view radiology reports compared to patients with commercial insurance (OR = 0.38, _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusion

More than half of patients with access to online radiology reports viewed them, with higher viewing rates associated with viewing other types of reports and lower rates associated with characteristics of traditionally underserved patient populations.

## Introduction

Patient web portals are online tools that provide patients direct and secure access to their personal medical records. Recent trends leaning toward increased transparency and improved communication between doctors and patients have led to the rapid proliferation of web portals, changing the dynamics of shared health information and decision-making . These changes have been highlighted by federal policies enacted to promote meaningful use of health information technology with the aims of improving productivity and efficiency of healthcare delivery . Although initial doctor and patient adoption of online web portal tools was modest, demand has steadily increased over the past couple of decades . Financial incentives by Medicare and private insurers have aided in successful implementation of online web portals at large, integrated health systems, where use has been established for numerous functions including patient scheduling, test result notification, and doctor-patient communication .

Although long-term outcome data are limited, potential benefits include improvements in medication adherence, patient safety, patient engagement, rates of screening, patient-provider communication, efficiency of office visits, and satisfaction with care . Initial research has been mostly positive, but patient- and doctor-related obstacles have been identified including privacy concerns, increases in clinical report preparation time, and difficulty addressing controversial issues related to candid, written assessments by doctors regarding their patients' substance abuse, mental health issues, and obesity . Despite these possible challenges, both doctors and patients remain enthusiastic about patients playing a more active role in their healthcare through direct access to their medical record .
