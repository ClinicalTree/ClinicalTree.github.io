## Rationale and Objectives

To (1) apply a quantitative volumetric textural analysis (VTA) to colorectal masses at CT colonography (CTC) for the differentiation of malignant and benign lesions and to (2) compare VTA with human performance.

## Materials and Methods

A validated, quantitative VTA method was applied to 63 pathologically proven colorectal masses (mean size, 4.2 cm; range, 3–8 cm) at noncontrast CTC in 59 adults (mean age, 66.5 years; range, 45.9–91.6 years). Fifty-one percent (32/63) of the masses were invasive adenocarcinoma, and the remaining 49% (31/63) were large benign adenomas. Three readers with CTC experience independently assessed the likelihood of malignancy using a 5-point scale (1 = definitely benign, 2 = probably benign, 3 = indeterminate, 4 = probably malignant, 5 = definitely malignant). Areas under the curve (AUCs) and accuracy levels were compared.

## Results

VTA achieved optimal sensitivity of 83.6% vs 91.7% for human readers ( _P_ = .034), with specificities of 87.5% and 77.4%, respectively ( _P_ = .007). No significant difference in overall accuracy was seen between VTA and human readers (85.5% vs 84.7%, _P_ = .753). The AUC for differentiating benign and malignant lesions was 0.936 for VTA and 0.917 for human readers. Intraclass correlation coefficient among the human readers was 0.76, indicating good to excellent agreement.

## Conclusion

VTA demonstrates excellent performance for distinguishing benign from malignant colorectal masses (≥3 cm) at CTC, comparable yet potentially complementary to experienced human performance.

## Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major public health issue in the United States, with recent figures estimating nearly 135,000 new diagnoses and 50,000 deaths per year . Fortunately, CRC is generally believed to begin as a benign colorectal polyp, with most requiring many years to progress to invasive cancer . The detection and removal of these benign precursors prior to malignant transformation through screening programs remains the cornerstone of CRC prevention . Over the last 10–15 years, CT colonography (CTC) has emerged as a validated CRC screening tool, recently gaining US Preventative Services Task Force approval as a recommended CRC screening test . CTC is comparable in effectiveness to traditional optical colonoscopy (OC) for the detection of advanced colorectal neoplasia and has the advantages of being noninvasive, cost-effective , and less operator dependent .

Historically, distinguishing large benign colorectal precursor mass lesions from truly invasive malignant cancers has presented a challenge both at CTC and at OC. A large degree of overlap exists between large advanced benign and malignant lesions with regard to observable features of lesion appearance (eg, size and morphology). Consequently, the standard of care for screening CTC is to send all large polyps (diameter ≥10 mm) for polypectomy, whereas the management of small (6–9 mm) lesions can be individualized between polypectomy and CTC surveillance . The standard of care for screening OC has generally been to remove all polyps regardless of size, although some have deviated from this practice. However, recent studies have reinforced that not all benign neoplastic polyps—even those of identical histologic subtype—present the same risk for growth and malignant transformation , and the search for novel methods to predict polyp behavior remains an active area of research.
