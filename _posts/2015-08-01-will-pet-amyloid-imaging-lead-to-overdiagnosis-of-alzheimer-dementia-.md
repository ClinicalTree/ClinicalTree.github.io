Alzheimer disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes dementia, affects millions of elderly Americans and represents a growing problem with the aging of the population. There has been an increasing effort for improved and earlier diagnosis for AD. Several newly developed radiolabeled compounds targeting β-amyloid plaques, one of the major pathologic biomarkers of AD, have recently become available for clinical use. These radiopharmaceuticals allow for in vivo noninvasive visualization of abnormal β-amyloid deposits in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Amyloid PET imaging has demonstrated high sensitivity for pathologic cerebral amyloid deposition in multiple studies. Principal drawbacks to this new diagnostic test are declining specificity in older age groups and uncertain clinical role given lack of disease-modifying therapy for AD. Although there is strong evidence for the utility of amyloid PET in certain situations, detailed in a set of guidelines for appropriate use from the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, the question of overdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a disease that would result in neither symptoms nor deaths, using this new medical tool needs to be carefully considered in light of efforts to secure reimbursement for the new technology that is already widely available for use as a clinical tool.

## Scope of Alzheimer Epidemic

Dementia is the decline of neuropsychological function, affecting one or more cognitive domains including memory, reasoning, judgment, visuospatial abilities, language, or behavior, of sufficient severity that it interferes with one's usual activities. Causes of dementia include Alzheimer disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLB), frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD), vascular dementia, and structural causes such as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), among others; with few exceptions, such as early treatment of NPH, these remain progressive irreversible diseases.

AD is the most common type of dementia, responsible for approximately 50%–60% of cases and is thought to affect 5.2 million Americans including >200,000 under the age of 65 years . By the year 2050, the prevalence of AD in the United States is estimated to be 13.8 million . From those 5 million over the age of 65 years, AD causes 600,000 deaths, comprising 32% of all older adult deaths in the United States, which is expected to grow to 1.6 million deaths in 2050, or 43% of all older adult deaths in the United States . Although the rates of dementia vary between countries , this trend also appears to be global with an estimated 1%–2% of people who will be living with AD by the year 2050 . Despite the relatively high incidence, it is estimated that only half of all cases are diagnosed . With under-recognition and underdiagnosis currently widespread, there are concerted efforts to improve early diagnosis underway.

Continued growth of the AD population will directly translate into a heavier economic and societal burden. Specifically, in the United States for 2014, total care costs for dementia patients aged >65 years old were estimated to be $214 billion . Additional unpaid care costs by family members were valued at $220 billion . Although already high, these costs are thought to underestimate the total actual costs of dementia and AD . Therefore, AD represents an increasingly common and debilitating disease with subsequent heavy financial and societal burden on a global scale. It is no surprise that there is great demand for a predictive test from patients and physicians alike . However, the push for diagnosis at earlier milder stages of disease, where clinical presentations of various syndromes are often overlapping, also pushes the limits of current clinical testing and diagnostic imaging modalities, dominated by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorine 18 radioisotope label \[F-18\] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET;  Fig 1 ). There are concerns that a newly developed technology, PET targeting cerebral β-amyloid will result in additional overdiagnosis of AD , defined as the diagnosis of a disease that would result in neither symptoms nor deaths, particularly as no effective therapy has yet been developed . The merits of screening for dementia have been reviewed elsewhere ; this review will evaluate the possible effects of amyloid PET on overdiagnosis in AD in the current clinical environment.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Making or Excluding a Diagnosis of AD

Although there are currently no disease-modifying effective therapies for neurodegenerative causes of dementia, there is a growing interest in early diagnosis. First, early diagnosis allows earlier discussion of prognosis, which can affect life planning. Early diagnosis guides the selection of the modestly effective therapies available, as well as the exclusion of therapies targeted for other diseases, avoiding unnecessary side effects. Finally, although still hypothetical at this time, it is believed that any therapy developed in the future would be most efficacious only if administered early in the course of disease, before the onset of irreversible synaptic and neural destruction; future development of a disease-modifying therapy would dramatically change the clinical role for amyloid PET and other tests for early diagnosis.
