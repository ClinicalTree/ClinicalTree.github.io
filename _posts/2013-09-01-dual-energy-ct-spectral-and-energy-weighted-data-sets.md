## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate dual-energy computed tomography spectral and energy weighted (W) image data sets concerning carotid stenosis and calcified plaque detection.

## Materials and Methods

Ninety patients were evaluated using contrast media injection. Energy used for dual-energy computed tomography was tin filter with 140/80 kiloVoltage and effective milli Ampere second was 147.4/270.6. Image reconstruction was performed using D30f kernel and 0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 weightings. Data sets were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods.

## Results

The signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and figure-of-merit were significantly higher in 0.6-W compared to 140-kV or 80-kV data (all _P_ < .05). Plaque thickness, span, and longitudinal diameters were different for 140-kV, 0.6-W, and 80-kV data (all _P_ < .05). Stenotic intra-luminal diameter was significantly different among 140 kV, 0.6 W, and 80 kV data (all _P_ < .05). A comparison between 0.6 W and digital subtraction angiography was nonsignificant ( _P_ \> .05) in normal lumen measurement.

## Conclusions

The dimension of calcified plaque and carotid artery with contrast media decreased with increased energy. The percentage of carotid artery stenosis does not vary with different energy. Care must be taken for procedural planning like sizing of stents. Measured diameters of the 0.6 W were close to digital subtraction angiography; we suggest that planning should be based on the images acquired using 0.6 weighting.

Multiple imaging modalities such as ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging , and computed tomography (CT) have proved their efficient role in the examination of vessels. CT has a major role in evaluating artery stenosis or calcified plaques and is almost equivalent to catheter angiography for assessment . Magnetic resonance angiography offers an equivalent accuracy in artery stenosis evaluation compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) . Recently, there has been a rapid increase in the use of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT). A recent article showed that DECT provides a good correlation of grading stenosis in comparison with the gold standard of catheter angiography. DECT was introduced in 2006, and this modality provides high temporal resolution of 83 ms in a monosegment reconstruction mode . A recent study showed that separation of objects such as water, adipose, iodine, and calcium concentrations are possible using multienergy CT images. The DECT system consists of two X-ray tubes, and it uses two different energies simultaneously for the imaging of patients. The two responsible radiation interaction mechanisms in the diagnostic energy are the Compton effect (CE) and the photoelectric effect (PEE).

The PEE is the mechanism that controls the image quality and radiation dose in diagnostic radiology. The PEE is directly related to the energy used for the imaging and the atomic number or density of the material under investigation. Contrast media (CM) consists of iodine that used for clinical examination of patients and calcified plaque consists of calcium; both are considered to be materials with a high atomic number compared to body tissues. Improvement of the cerebral artery blood flow and resolution of the neurological symptoms are highly dependent on the luminal dimension of the carotid artery. Treatment decisions often depend on carotid artery percent stenosis, and sizing of stents relies on an accurate measurement of luminal diameters. Hence, any possible variability in luminal diameter on the CT image potentially leads to a great clinical impact. In this study, we used a relatively new technology, the latest DECT, to study the luminal diameter of the extracranial carotid arteries using CM and calcified plaque detection. Here, the question arises of whether the DECT data sets produce similar results during diagnosis for the dimensions of calcification and the carotid artery measurements.
