I became the editor of _Academic Radiology_ in January 2000 with a strong belief that our journal had a very important role to play in imaging research, teaching, and promoting the careers of young investigators. I believe this is even truer today. Our 10th anniversary is an appropriate time to review the progress of our first decade, appraise the current status of the journal, and describe some changes that will occur.

## New publisher

In 2004, Elsevier Science became the new publisher of _Academic Radiology_ . Although we had a wonderful relationship with our former publisher, the RSNA, we are fortunate to have partnered with Elsevier, one of the largest and most well-respected publishers in the medical field. Elsevier publishes more than 1600 scientific journals, including more than 500 in biomedicine. They are also a leader in electronic publishing, and the smooth transition to the EES (Elsevier Editorial System) has enabled us to be more responsive to our reviewers and authors.

In 2009, our journal turnaround time was as follows:

Submission to Editor Assignment 1.4 days Average number of days between the date the manuscript was received and the first Editor was assigned. Submission to First Decision 26.2 days Average number of days between the date the manuscript was received and the first decision.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) research abstracts describing the awards to principal investigators with primary appointments in radiology departments continue to be available online.

## Online publication

The journal continues to enjoy steady growth in the numbers of high-quality papers submitted each year. As a result, we now consistently have 40–50 papers in the pipeline and the wait for publication has grown to 5 months after final acceptance. Although this may be an acceptable timeline in comparison with many other journals, authors of articles in _Academic Radiology_ have had an expectation of more rapid publication. To address these concerns, we began posting accepted articles on the journal website before the print issue is published. There is now a link to these “articles in press” on the _Academic Radiology_ home page at  www.academicradiology.org where they are posted in the order that corrections are received from authors. These articles in press appear in final form, except for missing issue and page designations, are citable by DOI (digital object identifier) and can be picked up by PubMed.
