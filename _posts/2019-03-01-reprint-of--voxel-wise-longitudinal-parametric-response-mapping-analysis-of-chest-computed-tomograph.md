## Rationale and Objectives

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a heterogeneous disease characterized by small airway abnormality and emphysema. We hypothesized that a voxel-wise computed tomography analytic approach would identify patterns of disease progression in smokers.

## Materials and Methods

We analyzed 725 smokers in spirometric GOLD stages 0-4 with two chest CTs 5 years apart. Baseline inspiration, follow-up inspiration and follow-up expiration images were spatially registered to baseline expiration so that each voxel had correspondences across all time points and respiratory phases. Voxel-wise Parametric Response Mapping (PRM) was then generated for the baseline and follow-up scans. PRM classifies lung as normal, functional small airway disease (PRM  fSAD ), and emphysema (PRM  EMPH ).

## Results

Subjects with low baseline PRM  fSAD and PRM  EMPH predominantly had an increase in PRM  fSAD on follow-up; those with higher baseline PRM  fSAD and PRM  EMPH mostly had increases in PRM  EMPH . For GOLD 0 participants ( _n_ = 419), mean 5-year increases in PRM  fSAD and PRM  EMPH were 0.3% for both; for GOLD 1–4 participants ( _n_ = 306), they were 0.6% and 1.6%, respectively. Eighty GOLD 0 subjects (19.1%) had overall radiologic progression (30.0% to PRM  fSAD , 52.5% to PRM  EMPH , and 17.5% to both); 153 GOLD 1–4 subjects (50.0%) experienced progression (17.6% to PRM  fSAD , 48.4% to PRM  EMPH , and 34.0% to both). In a multivariable model, both baseline PRM  fSAD and PRM  EMPH were associated with development of PRM  EMPH on follow-up, although this relationship was diminished at higher levels of baseline PRM  EMPH .

## Conclusion

A voxel-wise longitudinal PRM analytic approach can identify patterns of disease progression in smokers with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

## Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by small airway abnormality and emphysema ( ). While emphysema is a prominent feature of severe disease, little is known about the stages and timeline of its progression on a radiological level. Parametric Response Mapping (PRM) analysis which incorporates information from both inspiratory and expiratory computed tomography (CT) images is one way to quantitatively assess this data. PRM captures the change in lung density between matched inspiratory and expiratory images ( ), thereby enabling the distinction between normal lung parenchyma (PRM  NORM ), emphysema (PRM  EMPH ), and non-emphysematous air trapping referred to as functional small airway disease (PRM  fSAD ).

However, the analysis of longitudinal quantitative CT data is challenging and optimal methods have not been firmly established, particularly for PRM. Here we conduct an analysis of a large multicenter study of current and former smokers to characterize changes in PRM  fSAD and PRM  EMPH over 5 years of follow-up using voxel-wise coregistration of the baseline and follow-up images to characterize patterns of progression in smokers with and without COPD. We limited this analysis to participants who had both their initial and follow-up chest CTs with identical scanning parameters and comparable lung volumes between the two scans to minimize variability in the data. We hypothesized that baseline PRM  fSAD is a radiographic precursor to emphysema.

where _V_ represents the total lung volume obtained from a segmentation of the left and right lungs on the CT image. Parametric Response Maps were then generated for the baseline and follow-up time points by Imbio LLC (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) ( ). Briefly, all voxels < −950 HU on the inspiration scan were classified as PRM  EMPH , voxels ≥ −950 HU on the inspiration scan and < −856 HU on the expiration scan were classified as PRM  fSAD , and voxels ≥ −950 HU on the inspiration scan and ≥ −856 HU on the expiration scan were classified as PRM  NORM .
