## Rationale and Objectives

The identification of body fluids in computed tomography poses a major diagnostic challenge. The chemical composition of body fluids deviates only slightly from water with very similar computed tomographic (CT) values, which typically range from 0 to 100 HU. The aim of this study was to assess physical and chemical properties of different body fluids in an ex vivo setting.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 44 samples of blood, blood mixed with pus, pus, bile, and urine obtained during diagnostic and therapeutic punctures were scanned at 80 and 140 kV. Data was quantitatively assessed using the spectral _ρZ_ -projection algorithm, which converts dual-energy CT scans into mass density ( _ρ_ ) and effective atomic number ( _Z  eff._ ) information.

## Results

Attenuation values measured at 80 and 140 kV were largely overlapping. CT values allowed, to some degree, for the differentiation of bile or pus from blood or the blood/pus mixture. By applying the _ρZ_ -projection, most substances, except for urine, were distinguishable with only small standard deviations ranging between 0.003 and 0.007 g/cm  3 for mass density and between 0.020 and 0.043 for _Z  eff._ .

## Conclusion

The _ρZ_ -projection method is suited to quantitatively assess mass density and effective atomic number of ex vivo body fluid samples. In clinical routine, this technique might be useful for identifying unclear fluid collections even in unenhanced computed tomography.

Computed tomography is one of the most important non-invasive diagnostic imaging modalities. It provides three-dimensional representations of the x-ray attenuation coefficient _μ_ (r) with submillimeter spatial resolution. However, it is limited in soft tissue contrast resolution . Various types of soft tissue and lesions differ only slightly in density and chemical composition and thus their measured x-ray attenuation coefficients are very similar.

To overcome this limitation, intravenous contrast agents are routinely administered. However, differentiation of nonperfused fluid collections such as hematoma, lymphoceles, abscess, or urinoma remains difficult , particularly if there are ambiguous clinical findings, or shortly after surgery. Moreover, there are many patients who may not receive iodinated contrast agents. Over the last decade, several studies have addressed the problem of fluid differentiation in computed tomography, but failed to provide clinically applicable solutions . Thus, low contrast resolution of noncontrast enhanced computed tomography is still a relevant issue in fluid differentiation.

The center points of the shaded ellipses represent the arithmetic means of ρ and Z eff. values of the different samples, whereas the axis lengths indicate the standard deviation for the corresponding sample. Pus and blood can be clearly distinguished, while bile and pus partly overlap. The mixture of blood and pus has intermediate values, but it can be differentiated from the blood samples. The latter is not possible using the attenuation values alone.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SpectralZProjectionMethodforCharacterizationofBodyFluidsinComputedTomography/3_1s20S1076633209000038.jpg)

Here the spectral attenuation coefficient ( _κ/ρ_ ) is factorized into the mass density ρ and the specific spectral attenuation function ( _κ/ρ_ )(E). Note that the left side of (  Eqn 1 ) contains the measured values

The functions _f  1_ (Z), _f  2_ (Z) and _F_ ( _Z_ ) can be calculated prior to the measurement with the known spectral weighting functions _w  i_ ( _E_ ) and tabulated ( _κ/ρ_ )( _E, Z_ ) from experimental data by, e.g., Perkins et al and Cullen et al . Equations (3a, b) directly transform two measured images into _ρ_ and _Z_ images. For medical computed tomography we can generally expect Z  eff. to be lying in the interval \[1… 20\] and _ρ_ in the interval \[0… 2\] g/cm  3 .
