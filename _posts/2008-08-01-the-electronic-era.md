It seems to me as I brood on matters affecting radiology for which I am neither responsible nor to blame that as medical imaging plunges into the electronic era, a significant dichotomy is affecting its future.

One of the first things I was told when I hired on at the American College of Radiology almost half a century ago was that radiologists were consultants. It was their nature and duty to tell referring physicians what they saw and to counsel them about more than just the presence of shadowy abnormalities. When I visited radiologists in their departments, I noticed that the concept of consultation varied enormously depending on the personality of the chief and the standard he set for his department.

There were some departments with a large coffeepot where most members of the medical staff visited daily to talk about their patients and other medical affairs and the impact of last night's basketball game at the local high school. I remember hearing a lot of clinicians asking, “What do you think I should do with this patient?” And I remember the friendly answers ranging from definite advice to the admission that the radiologist had not seen enough comparable cases to have any valid idea about what to do. But the ambiance seemed to have a lot to do with the status of radiology in that hospital.

I also visited departments where viewing rooms were a thing of the future, if ever, where radiologists were confined to their reading rooms and the rest of the staff were resigned to waiting days or even weeks before the typed radiology report reached them. The bonhomie of casual consulting was missing and some of the radiologists wondered why they got so little support from colleagues when disputes arose.

So the advent of digital imaging, the Picture Archiving Communication System (PACS), teleradiology, and even telephone transcriptions speeded the process of getting the radiologist's interpretive findings to the clinical docs. In the same years, personal contacts faded. Neither staff colleagues nor house staff and medical students could get a warm feeling from reading a terse printout. This is not to say that some departments did not keep the large coffeepots. But personal contacts were more difficult to attain. Some radiologists in large hospitals might go years without ever having personal contact with other staff members.

Now, with the proliferation of teleradiology, the radiology interpreters may be halfway around the world and the referring physicians may never meet them or have any direct contacts or discussions. Do medical staffs even know who is interpreting images for them? Does an unknown foreign interpreter beat no radiologist at all? Or, is this one more reason why some American physicians in other disciplines want to do their own imaging?
