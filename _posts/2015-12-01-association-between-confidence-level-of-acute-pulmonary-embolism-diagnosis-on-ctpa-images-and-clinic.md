## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose was to evaluate clinical characteristics associated with low confidence in diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) as expressed in computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) reports and to evaluate the effect of confidence level in PE diagnosis on patient clinical outcomes.

## Materials and Methods

This study included radiology reports from 1664 consecutive CTPA considered positive for acute PE (8/2003–5/2010). All reports were retrospectively assessed for the level of confidence in diagnosis. Baseline characteristics and outcomes (therapies related to PE and short-term mortality) were compared between high and low confidence groups. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between the confidence level and outcomes.

## Results

One-hundred sixty of 1664 (9.6%) reports had language that reflected a low confidence in PE diagnosis. The low confidence group had smaller (segmental and subsegmental) suspected emboli (prevalence, 72.5% vs. 50.7%; _P_ < .001) and more comorbidities. The low confidence group had a lower likelihood of receiving PE-related therapies (adjusted odds ratio \[OR\], 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–031, _P_ < .001), but there was no change in the all-cause and PE-related 30-day and/or 90-day mortality (OR of death for low confidence, 0.81–1.13, _P_ values > .5).

## Conclusions

Roughly 10% of positive CTPA reports had uncertainty in PE findings, and patients with reports categorized as low confidence had smaller emboli and more comorbidities. Although the low confidence group was less likely to receive PE-related therapies, patients in this group were not associated with higher probability of short-term mortality.

For patients with clinically suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the primary imaging modality based on its speed, strong test characteristics , demonstration of other important thoracic findings, and improved patient outcomes when the results are communicated promptly . Although the in-hospital mortality rate for untreated major PE is 1%–60%, it drops significantly in patients who receive prompt anticoagulation . Low confidence in radiology reporting could, in theory, lead to delay in treatment initiation, increase patient risk through unwarranted anticoagulation , and compromise patient outcomes. Moreover, patients with less confident radiology reports may undergo more frequent repeated imaging with associated costs and radiation exposure.

The referring clinician prefers a definitive impression as opposed to a less confident report . Most referring physicians consider the “Conclusion” or “Impression” to be the single most important part of the radiology report . The use of terms that reflect low confidence (eg appears, suspected, suggestive of, possible, probable, and suspicious) is multifactorial . From the radiologist perspective, lower confidence in reporting arises from image technology limitations, unavailable history and indication for the imaging, variation in level of training, patient noncompliance, anatomic variation, unavailability of standards for reporting, or for protection against litigation .
