## Rationale and Objectives

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is highly heterogeneous and not well understood. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (Xe129) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a unique way to assess important lung functions such as gas uptake. In this pilot study, we exploited multiple imaging modalities, including computed tomography (CT), gadolinium-enhanced perfusion MRI, and Xe129 MRI, to perform a detailed investigation of changes in lung morphology and functions in COPD. Utility and strengths of Xe129 MRI in assessing COPD were also evaluated against the other imaging modalities.

## Materials and Methods

Four COPD patients and four age-matched normal subjects participated in this study. Lung tissue density measured by CT, perfusion measures from gadolinium-enhanced MRI, and ventilation and gas uptake measures from Xe129 MRI were calculated for individual lung lobes to assess regional changes in lung morphology and function, and to investigate correlations among the different imaging modalities.

## Results

No significant differences were found for all measures among the five lobes in either the COPD or age-matched normal group. Strong correlations ( _R_ \> 0.5 or < −0.5, _p_ < 0.001) were found between ventilation and perfusion measures. Also gas uptake by blood as measured by Xe129 MRI showed strong correlations with CT tissue density and ventilation measures ( _R_ \> 0.5 or < −0.5, _p_ < 0.001) and moderate to strong correlations with perfusion measures ( _R_ \> 0.4 or < −0.5, _p_ < 0.01). Four distinctive patterns of functional abnormalities were found in patients with COPD.

## Conclusion

Xe129 MRI has high potential to uniquely identify multiple changes in lung physiology in COPD using a single breath-hold acquisition.

## Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death and disability around the world. Clinical diagnosis and prognosis of COPD are still primarily based on irreversible airflow limitation measured by spirometry. However, multiple studies reported heterogeneous phenotypes of COPD that are far more complicated than being simply defined by irreversible airflow limitation ( ). Loss of lung function and abnormalities of gas exchange develop early ( ) and increase in prevalence as the severity of COPD increases ( ). Chronic hypoxemia was reported to be closely related to decline in the patient's quality of life, reduced exercise tolerance, and greater risk of death ( ).

There are numerous unanswered questions about the mechanisms of hypoxemia in COPD. Whether hypoxemia is merely caused by ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch or diffusion impairment is unclear ( ). Conventional imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and nuclear medicine scans, have limitations in the assessment of COPD. For example, chest CT provides detailed information about changes in lung morphometry, such as emphysema and bronchiectasis ( ), but limited information about lung function. Dual energy chest CT scan can provide iodine distribution maps, which can be used as a surrogate for pulmonary perfusion ( ). Nuclear medicine V/Q scan quantifies ventilation and perfusion ( ), but with limited spatial and temporal resolution. In addition, pulmonary function testing (PFT) provides whole lung measurements of lung function, but lacks regional localization of abnormalities. Therefore, reliable, noninvasive imaging techniques that can offer detailed assessment and accurate quantification of regional lung function will not only promote the understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD, but will also provide directions for treatment and valuable information about prognosis.

![Figure 2, Representative CT image, PBV, and Xe129 tissue-to-gas and RBC-to-gas ratio maps from subject C4 and C2. Alterations of lung function exhibited different patterns in the lung, as shown in Areas 1–4 in the figure. The RBC-to-gas ratio measured by Xe129 MRI reflecting overall gas exchange to the blood was found to be low in concordance with low tissue density measured by CT (Area 1), low perfusion measured by perfusion MRI (Area 3), or the combination of both (Area 2).

![Figure 3, Representative CT images, PBV maps, and Xe129 tissue-to-gas and RBC-to-gas ratio maps from subject C1 and C2 showed that Xe129 MRI could uniquely detect low gas exchange to blood by either low gas ventilation (Area 4) or potentially impaired gas exchange from lung tissue to the blood (Area 5).
