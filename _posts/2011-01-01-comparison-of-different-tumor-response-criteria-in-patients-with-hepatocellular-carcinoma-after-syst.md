## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare tumor changes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma receiving sorafenib using evaluation criteria of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) as opposed to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five patients with inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma receiving oral sorafenib underwent magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and follow-up every 8 weeks (range, 2–19 weeks; mean, 7.6 weeks). Data were evaluated retrospectively. Survey time until progression ranged from 5 to 102 weeks (mean, 25.6 weeks), with a total of 54 target lesions being monitored. Additionally, evaluation of serum α-fetoprotein was performed at follow-up.

## Results

The best response at follow-up using RECIST resulted in rates of 4% objective response (complete remission or partial remission), 24% (progressive disease), and 72% (stable disease). In contrast, AASLD and EASL criteria identified objective responses in 28% and 48%. Twenty percent of all patients classified as having progressive disease by RECIST were identified as having “pseudo”-progression due to extensive necrosis. Eleven percent of patients classified as having stable disease by RECIST were disclosed as essentially progressive. AASLD area and AASLD diameter disclosed 36% and 40% of patients as having partial remission, respectively, whereas EASL criteria discovered only 24%. There was no significant correlation between serum α-fetoprotein progression and AASLD, EASL, or RECIST evaluation criteria.

## Conclusions

Response monitoring via functional criteria such as AASLD or EASL criteria is likely to more accurately reflect vital tumor burden in hepatocellular carcinoma compared to RECIST.

For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first and so far only drug enabling an improved survival being demonstrated in a phase III study . In this clinical trial, sorafenib demonstrated a cytostatic, disease-stabilizing activity that prolonged the time to radiologic progression from 2.8 months (placebo group) to 5.5 months and the median survival time from 7.9 months (placebo group) to 10.7 months. With respect to molecular targets, sorafenib simultaneously inhibits kinases and growth factor receptors, thereby reducing tumor growth and abrogating neoangiogenesis . Recently, we reported that sorafenib induces early intralesional necrosis in hepatic tumors with profound changes in T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal intensities .

However, this progress in the systemic therapy of HCC is not yet accompanied by the application of simple and practical radiologic response criteria that allow reliable monitoring of this new and expensive treatment approach in day-to-day practice. As in the Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma Assessment Randomized Protocol (SHARP) trial , the evaluation of response to therapy is still based mainly on the use of unidimensional tumor measurements according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines . At the same time, there is growing evidence that evaluation by RECIST may not be the method of choice in monitoring treatment response or progression of HCC , which is a heterogeneous and often multifocal tumor. It is known that even within the same tumor nodule, varying degrees of differentiation exist. Growth rates may vary among lesions, which makes macroscopic growth patterns hard to interpret, underlining the importance of functional imaging . RECIST version 1.1 relies on the measurement of a maximum of five target lesions, not exceeding two per organ; subsequently, the sum of the greatest diameters is recorded followed by a final classification . Therefore, RECIST, per definition, is not capable of assessing therapy-induced intratumor changes in response to either local or targeted systemic therapy (eg, sorafenib), because it does not consider therapy-induced tissue necrosis .

In addition to imaging evaluations, the best AFP response is displayed. Concerning AFP evaluation, we considered a >20% decrease of AFP levels as PR and a >30% increase as PD; SD was considered as values between PR and PD. In patients with baseline AFP values < 20 g/L, the best AFP response was NA. Boldface type highlights all patients in whom all three diagnostic criteria that consider necrotic areas in a functional assessment indicated different interpretations than the evaluation according to RECIST.
