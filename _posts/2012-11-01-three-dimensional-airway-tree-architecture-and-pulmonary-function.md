## Rationale and Objectives

The airway tree is a primary conductive structure, and airways' morphologic characteristics, or variations thereof, may have an impact on airflow, thereby affecting pulmonary function. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between airway tree architecture, as depicted on computed tomography, and pulmonary function.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 548 chest computed tomographic examinations acquired on different patients at full inspiration were included in this study. The patients were enrolled in a study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Specialized Center for Clinically Oriented Research) and underwent pulmonary function testing in addition to computed tomographic examinations. A fully automated airway tree segmentation algorithm was used to extract the three-dimensional airway tree from each examination. Using a skeletonization algorithm, airway tree volume–normalized architectural measures, including total airway length, branch count, and trachea length, were computed. Correlations between airway tree measurements with pulmonary function testing parameters and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity in terms of the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease classification were computed using Spearman's rank correlations.

## Results

Non-normalized total airway volume and trachea length were associated ( _P_ < .01) with lung capacity measures (ie, functional residual capacity, total lung capacity, inspiratory capacity, vital capacity, residual volume, and forced expiratory vital capacity). Spearman's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.27 to 0.55 ( _P_ < .01). With the exception of trachea length, all normalized architecture-based measures (ie, total airway volume, total airway length, and total branch count) had statistically significant associations with the lung function measures (forced expiratory volume in 1 second and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced expiratory vital capacity), and adjusted volume was associated with all three respiratory impedance measures (lung reactance at 5 Hz, lung resistance at 5 Hz, and lung resistance at 20 Hz), and adjusted branch count was associated with all respiratory impedance measures but lung resistance at 20 Hz. When normalized for lung volume, all airway architectural measures were statistically significantly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity, with Spearman's correlation coefficients ranging from −0.338 to −0.546 ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

Despite the large variability in anatomic characteristics of the airway tree across subjects, architecture-based measures demonstrated statistically significant associations ( _P_ < .01) with nearly all pulmonary function testing measures, as well as with disease severity.

Morphologic variations in lung anatomy are assumed to be frequently associated with changes in pulmonary function . However, the manner and extent to which changes in the lung structure affect lung function and/or are associated with early lung disease remain largely unknown. Conventional pulmonary function testing (PFT) provides a global assessment of lung function, but these measurements have limited inferential knowledge of lung structural changes and the manner in which structural changes may relate to lung disease. The airways are of particular interest in this regard because of their important role in ventilation and the potential effect airway remodeling may have on airflow obstruction. Anatomically, the airways appear as a treelike branching network of tubes that are directly exposed to airborne viruses, particulate matter, smoke, and other pollutants in the external environment. Any morphologic variations of the airway tree may affect airflow and ultimately the ability of the lungs to exchange gas. With advances in modern imaging technology, there have been a large number of noninvasive investigations of the possible relationships between in vivo airway morphologic characteristics and pulmonary function . Computed tomographic (CT) imaging is widely used in these investigations because of its noninvasive ability to visualize lung anatomy in significant detail. These studies have attempted to develop new methods for noninvasive, quantitative, and accurate assessment of pathologic conditions that affect pulmonary function and/or specific lung diseases, thus improving clinicians' diagnostic performance.

Among the various imaging-based measured features, airway wall thickness has been reported repeatedly as a predictor of lung function measures , in particular in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Because of challenges in accurately identifying the airway wall, airway wall measurements in early studies were largely restricted to airways perpendicular to the scanning plane. It is generally difficult to accurately measure airway wall thickness given the partial volume effects combined with the inherent CT image noise. The accurate assessment of wall thickness is also complicated by nonhomogeneous airway surroundings (background tissue) that may include adjacent airways, lung parenchyma, and blood vessels. Achenbach et al reported that airway wall morphometry could be grossly in error, in particular as related to measurements of small airways. Coxson also stated that “none of the studies published to date show ‘excellent’ correlations between lung function and CT measures of emphysema and airway wall remodeling.”
