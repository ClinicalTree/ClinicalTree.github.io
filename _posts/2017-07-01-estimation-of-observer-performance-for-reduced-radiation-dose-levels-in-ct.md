## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to estimate observer performance for a range of dose levels for common computed tomography (CT) examinations (detection of liver metastases or pulmonary nodules, and cause of neurologic deficit) to prioritize noninferior dose levels for further analysis.

## Materials and Methods

Using CT data from 131 examinations (abdominal CT, 44; chest CT, 44; head CT, 43), CT images corresponding to 4%–100% of the routine clinical dose were reconstructed with filtered back projection or iterative reconstruction. Radiologists evaluated CT images, marking specified targets, providing confidence scores, and grading image quality. Noninferiority was assessed using reference standards, reader agreement rules, and jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figures of merit. Reader agreement required that a majority of readers at lower dose identify target lesions seen by the majority of readers at routine dose.

## Results

Reader agreement identified dose levels lower than 50% and 4% to have inadequate performance for detection of hepatic metastases and pulmonary nodules, respectively, but could not exclude any low dose levels for head CT. Estimated differences in jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic figures of merit between routine and lower dose configurations found that only the lowest dose configurations tested (ie, 30%, 4%, and 10% of routine dose levels for abdominal, chest, and head CT examinations, respectively) did not meet criteria for noninferiority. At lower doses, subjective image quality declined before observer performance. Iterative reconstruction was only beneficial when filtered back projection did not result in noninferior performance.

## Conclusion

Opportunity exists for substantial radiation dose reduction using existing CT technology for common diagnostic tasks.

## Introduction

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is widely used in medical practice to quickly and accurately diagnose a large number of medical conditions and to guide appropriate medical or surgical management. CT is commonly available and readily interpreted by radiologists and referring clinicians, and can provide images with high spatial and temporal resolution that cover large regions of the body, with few contraindications to imaging.

The most notable concern for CT imaging is that it requires exposure to ionizing radiation, and there are both provider and patient concerns over the risk of radiation-induced malignancy, with this risk being low but uncertain for each patient and a subject of ongoing debate . The medical justification for performing CT imaging is that anticipated benefit exceeds anticipated risk. The optimal dose of radiation that will accomplish the diagnostic task but not compromise diagnostic performance should be used . However, this “optimal” dose is not known for even the most common CT examinations, resulting in a wide spectrum of radiation doses being used, even for frequently performed examinations . Alternatively, some radiology practices reduce radiation dose so much that observer performance is compromised, negating the beneficial impact of CT imaging. The lack of available evidence on what dose levels are required to achieve specific results is due to many factors, for example, evolving technology, inability or impracticality of obtaining multiple dose levels simultaneously or consecutively, fear that substantial lowering of the dose may result in compromised diagnostic benefit, and difficulty in study design and expense . To this end, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering has held a series of expert conferences and sponsored grants to lay out a pathway to systematically lower radiation dose from CT imaging .

![Figure 1, Study schema. For each of three common diagnostic tasks in CT imaging (contrast-enhanced abdominal CT to detect liver metastases, unenhanced chest CT to detect indeterminate pulmonary nodules, and unenhanced head CT to detect cause of neurologic deficit), three subspecialized radiologists examined CT images corresponding to five or six dose levels reconstructed with both FBP and IR, using a specially designed computer workstation to mark target lesions of interest, with reader markings and confidence compared to an established reference standard. Reader agreement rules and a JAFROC FOM were used to compare observer performance at varying dose levels.

For positive cases, a majority of readers had to identify all lesions seen by a majority of readers using the routine dose level; for negative cases, the majority of readers made no nonlesion localizations (ie, no false-positive markings). Bold numbers indicate failure to meet preset thresholds for successful dose-reconstruction configurations. The number of cases with essential lesions reflects cases with target lesions identified by two or more readers at routine dose levels.
