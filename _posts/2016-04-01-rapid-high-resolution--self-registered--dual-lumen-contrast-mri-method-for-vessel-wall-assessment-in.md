## Rationale and Objectives

Contrast-enhanced angiographic evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) is the reference standard for assessing peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, because PAD and diabetes often coexist, the prevalence of renal insufficiency is a major challenge to contrast-based angiography. The objective of this work is to describe and demonstrate a new application of three-dimensional double-echo steady-state (3D DESS) as a noncontrast vascular MRI method for evaluating peripheral atherosclerosis at 3 Tesla (3T).

## Materials and Methods

A water-selective 3D DESS pulse sequence was designed to simultaneously collect two steady-state free-precession signals (free induction decay and Echo) yielding “black blood” (BB) and “gray blood” (GB) images. For completeness Bloch equation, simulations were performed to characterize DESS signals of various tissues including blood at different velocities and to assess two healthy subjects for the purpose of pulse sequence optimization. Exploratory studies were performed as an add-on protocol to an existing study involving patients with PAD. To evaluate the method's specificity for detecting calcification, images from select patients were compared against CT angiography.

## Results

Simulations agreed qualitatively with _in vivo_ images supporting DESS' potential for generating distinct lumen contrast (GB vs BB). Lesions representing calcium were easily identifiable on the basis of signal void occurring on both image types and were confirmed by CT angiography. Further, BB allowed visualization of stent restenosis, and data suggest its ability to visualize acute thrombus by virtue of T2 weighting.

## Conclusion

Preliminary investigation and results suggest noncontrast 3D DESS to have the potential to improve diagnosis of PAD patients by providing detailed structural assessment of vessel-wall architecture.

## Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis affecting 8–12 million individuals in the United States. Patients with PAD have a fivefold and a two- to threefold greater risk of heart attack and stroke, respectively, and higher mortality rate relative to those without PAD . Among subjects aged 50 years and older with diabetes mellitus and a history of smoking, the prevalence of PAD can be as high as 30% . The most common clinical symptom is intermittent claudication or cramp-like pain in the legs and buttocks induced by exercise, which contributes to a poor quality of life and a high rate of depression . The progression of the disease can lead to critical limb ischemia where blood flow is severely impaired to the lower limbs due to stenosis.

Maximum intensity projections of contrast-based angiography can rapidly provide a “roadmap” of large vascular segments for the assessment of severity and extent of PAD. Typical spatial resolution of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) is limited to 1 mm, and the luminal images cannot provide tissue information such as vessel-wall thickening and calcification. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) is often preferred for speed and high-isotropic resolution, allowing reformation in any direction. However, diffuse calcification can confound diagnosis, particularly in smaller infrapopliteal arteries, which are common sites of PAD in diabetics . The gold standard for evaluating vascular diseases is catheter-based digital subtraction angiography (DSA), often utilized for planning surgical revascularization and angioplasty. Both CTA and DSA expose patients to ionization radiation. The greatest challenge of contrast-based angiography occurs in patients with compromised renal function, where prevalence is estimated at 27–36% because PAD and diabetes often coexist . Paradoxically, this is the patient population most indicated for angiographic examination, but these patients have a greater risk of contrast-induced acute renal failure, a source of significant morbidity and mortality.

Significant SSFP-Echo signal attenuation even at low velocity of 0.5 cm/s supports excellent blood suppression observed even near the walls of peripheral veins, e.g. Figure 3b and f . ( c ) FID as a gradient-recalled echo is much less tolerant of static field inhomogeneity. The simulation suggests that it is possible to discern intermuscular fat from vessel wall up to 100 Hz off-resonance.
