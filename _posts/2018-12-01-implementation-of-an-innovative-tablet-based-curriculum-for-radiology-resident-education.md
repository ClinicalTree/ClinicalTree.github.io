## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the impact of a tablet-based curriculum on the radiology resident educational experience.

## Materials and Methods

A comprehensive tablet-based curriculum was developed by creating subspecialty modules with appropriate content level for each required rotation at our diagnostic radiology residency program. Daily assignments included key learning points, readings, and reference presentation slides, covering all objectives published by the ABR Core Exam Study Guide. Residents were provided with iPad devices preconfigured with the curriculum and online access to most major radiology textbooks available in our institutional digital library. Assessment surveys were administered at baseline and 12 months following curriculum implementation.

## Results

Twenty-two residents completed both surveys. In comparing the pre versus postsurvey results, 32% versus 73% residents agreed or strongly agreed that study resources were well-organized, 41% versus 91% agreed or strongly agreed that study resources were easily accessible, 27% versus 77% agreed or strongly agreed that the modules encouraged active learning, 18% versus 82% agreed or strongly agreed that resources motivate them to study daily, 36% versus 82% agreed or strongly agreed that the resources adequately prepared the resident for the radiology board exam, and 36% versus 82% agreed or strongly agreed that they were satisfied with the resources provided by the residency program ( _p_ < 0.05).

## Conclusion

Our study demonstrated the positive impact of implementing a complete tablet-based curriculum on radiology resident motivation, satisfaction, and engagement. Use of mobile tablet devices has the potential to dramatically transform content delivery in residency education.

## Introduction

While the universal purpose of a residency program is to provide an education in a medical subspecialty, the learning experience is varied and self-motivated and frequently follows general objectives without a specific curriculum. Consequently, residents often find themselves puzzled regarding how to study most efficiently and effectively. Without much experience in the field, it is difficult, particularly for junior residents, to identify the best resources for different topics and discern which information is appropriate for their current educational level. Given that radiology is largely an image-based field, tablet use has an interesting potential for resident education and for addressing these learning impediments.

A previous study found that 79% of healthcare professionals use iPads for work purposes ( ). A second recent study encouraged radiology programs to utilize and provide tablet devices to residents given that 81% of respondents believed that they would spend more time learning radiology if given a tablet device ( ). Sharpe et al also demonstrated that digital books have become the number one education resource used at work, suggesting its role as a desired study resource ( ). Additional studies have assessed the general usage of tablets in radiology residency, but none to date have examined the development and implementation of a comprehensive tablet-based curriculum made specifically for radiology residents ( ).
