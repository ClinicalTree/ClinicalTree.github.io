## Rationale and Objectives

Patients' willingness to travel farther distances for certain imaging services may reflect their perceptions of the degree of differentiation of such services. We compare patients' travel times for a range of imaging examinations performed across a large academic health system.

## Materials and Methods

We searched the NYU Langone Medical Center Enterprise Data Warehouse to identify 442,990 adult outpatient imaging examinations performed over a recent 3.5-year period. Geocoding software was used to estimate typical driving times from patients' residences to imaging facilities. Variation in travel times was assessed among examination types.

## Results

The mean expected travel time was 29.2 ± 20.6 minutes, but this varied significantly (p < 0.001) among examination types. By modality, travel times were shortest for ultrasound (26.8 ± 18.9) and longest for positron emission tomography-computed tomography (31.9 ± 21.5). For magnetic resonance imaging, travel times were shortest for musculoskeletal extremity (26.4 ± 19.2) and spine (28.6 ± 21.0) examinations and longest for prostate (35.9 ± 25.6) and breast (32.4 ± 22.3) examinations. For computed tomography, travel times were shortest for a range of screening examinations \[colonography (25.5 **±** 20.8), coronary artery calcium scoring (26.1 **±** 19.2), and lung cancer screening (26.4 **±** 14.9)\] and longest for angiography (32.0 ± 22.6). For ultrasound, travel times were shortest for aortic aneurysm screening (22.3 **±** 18.4) and longest for breast (30.1 **±** 19.2) examinations. Overall, men (29.9 ± 21.6) had longer (p < 0.001) travel times than women (27.8 ± 20.3); this difference persisted for each modality individually (p ≤ 0.006).

## Conclusions

Patients' willingness to travel longer times for certain imaging examination types (particularly breast and prostate imaging) supports the role of specialized services in combating potential commoditization of imaging services. Disparities in travel times by gender warrant further investigation.

## Introduction

Much concern has been expressed of the threat of commoditization of radiology services . This in part relates to a fairly consistent patient experience for imaging examinations performed across imaging facilities as well as the lack of face-to-face interaction with radiologists for most noninvasive imaging encounters. As a result, patients may misperceive receiving an imaging examination with a professional interpretation as analogous to undergoing a basic laboratory test. In this case, patients may not necessarily recognize differences in both technical and radiologist quality when having an opportunity to select among imaging facilities, and instead make their decisions largely based on cost or convenience . Such a reality would encourage radiology practices to focus on the latter considerations and disincentivize investments in quality .

The risk of commoditization in radiology is unlikely to be homogeneous across imaging examinations. Radiology encompasses a range of distinct imaging modalities, as well as more granular specific examination types within individual modalities. Such imaging services vary in terms of the abundance and availability of performing facilities within a given region, as well as the nature of the patient experience during an examination. These factors in turn impact patients' perception of differentiation of a given service.
