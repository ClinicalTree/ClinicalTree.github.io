## Rationale and Objectives

Early detection of breast lesions using mammography has resulted in lower mortality rates. However, some breast lesions are mammography occult, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended, but it has lower specificity. It is possible to achieve higher specificity by using strain-encoded (SENC) MRI and/or magnetic resonance elastography. SENC breast MRI can measure the strain properties of breast tissue. Similarly, magnetic resonance elastography is used to measure the elasticity (ie, shear stiffness) of different tissue compositions interrogating the tissue mechanical properties. Reports have shown that malignant tumors are three to 13 times stiffer than normal tissue and benign tumors.

## Materials and Methods

The investigators have developed a SENC breast hardware device capable of periodically compressing the breast, thus allowing for longer scanning time and measuring the strain characteristics of breast tissue. This hardware enables the use of SENC MRI with high spatial resolution (1 × 1 × 5 mm  3 ) instead of fast SENC imaging. Simple controls and multiple safety measures were added to ensure accurate, repeatable, and safe in vivo experiments.

## Results

Phantom experiments showed that SENC breast MRI has higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio than fast SENC imaging under different scanning resolutions. Finally, the SENC breast device reproducibility measurements resulted in a difference of <1 mm with a 1% strain difference.

## Conclusions

SENC breast magnetic resonance images have higher signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratios than fast SENC images. Thus, combining SENC breast strain measurements with diagnostic breast MRI to differentiate benign from malignant lesions could potentially increase the specificity of diagnosis in the clinical setting.

According to the American Cancer Society’s 2009 report, one in eight women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. Early detection through periodic screening is the key to lower mortality rates, and the current methods used are mammography and ultrasound. However, some breast lesions are mammography and ultrasound occult (ie, those in dense breasts). Therefore, other methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are used especially in women who are at high risk to develop breast cancer.

Although MRI has high sensitivity (95%), its specificity remains moderate (83%) , and there is a need to increase specificity so that the number of unnecessary biopsy procedures can be reduced. Recent MRI methods have been proposed to further improve specificity, including diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (DWI/ADC) mapping , magnetic resonance spectroscopy , and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) , all of which were reviewed by El Khouli et al . DWI/ADC mapping can probe the movement of water and provide a measure of cellularity. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can give metabolic information on the breast tissue.

![Figure 1, Block diagram for our hardware consisting of a scanner side and a patient side. The scanner side is responsible for controlling the safety three-way solenoid, controlling the four-way solenoid to direct the airflow in and out of the backward and forward chambers, and generating the electrocardiographic signal to enable synchronization with the scanner. The patient side is made of two double-acting cylinders that fit under the breast coil and a safety switch that when enabled releases the airflow and stops the compression. Black lines are connected to the backward chamber, and gray lines are connected to the forward chambers of the double-acting cylinders. Dotted lines show airflow during the first half of the cycle, and solid lines show airflow during the second half of the cycle.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImprovedHardwareforHigherSpatialResolutionStrainencodedSENCBreastMRIforStrainMeasurements/0_1s20S1076633211000481.jpg)
