## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this work was to measure the accuracy of dual-energy computed tomography for identifying iodine and calcium and to determine the effects of calcium suppression in phantoms and lower-extremity computed tomographic (CT) angiographic data sets.

## Materials and Methods

Using a three-material basis decomposition method for 80- and 140-kVp data, the accuracy of correctly identified contrast medium and calcium voxels and the mean attenuation before and after calcium suppression were computed. Experiments were first performed on a phantom of homogenous contrast medium and hydroxyapatite samples with mean attenuation of 57.2, 126, and 274 Hounsfield units (HU) and 50.0, 122, and 265 HU, respectively. Experiments were repeated in corresponding attenuation groups of voxels from manually segmented bones and contrast medium–enhanced arteries in a lower-extremity CT angiographic data set with mean attenuation of 293 and 434 HU, respectively. Calcium suppression in atherosclerotic plaques of a cadaveric specimen was also studied, using micro–computed tomography as a reference, and in a lower-extremity CT angiographic data set with substantial below-knee calcified plaques.

## Results

Higher concentrations showed increased accuracy of iodine and hydroxyapatite identification of 87.4%, 99.7%, and 99.9% and 88.0%, 95.0%, and 99.9%, respectively. Calcium suppression was also more accurate with higher concentrations of iodine and hydroxyapatite, with mean attenuation after suppression of 47.1, 122, and 263 HU and 7.14, 11.6, and 12.6 HU, respectively. Similar patterns were seen in the corresponding attenuation groups of the contrast medium–enhanced arteries and bone in the clinical data set, which had overall accuracy of 81.3% and 78.9%, respectively, and mean attenuation after calcium suppression of 254 and 73.7 HU, respectively. The suppression of calcified atherosclerotic plaque was accurate compared with the micro-CT reference; however, the suppression in the clinical data set showed probable inappropriate suppression of the small vessels.

## Conclusion

Dual-energy computed tomography can detect and differentiate between contrast medium and calcified tissues, but its accuracy is dependent on the CT density of tissues and limited when CT attenuation is low.

Lower-extremity computed tomographic (CT) angiography (peripheral CTA) has evolved into an accurate, noninvasive imaging modality for the evaluation of patients with peripheral arterial disease ( ). Although high-resolution volumetric CT data sets of the entire peripheral arterial tree can be acquired in <40 seconds with modern (≥16-channel) CT scanners, visualization of the complex manifestations of peripheral arterial disease remains a major challenge ( ). First, bone editing requires substantial user interaction, even with advanced postprocessing tools. Second, vessel wall calcifications are a notorious problem, because calcified plaque precludes the direct visualization of arterial flow channels in maximum-intensity projections (MIPs) or volume-rendered images ( ). Additional postprocessing, such as the generation of curved planar reformations (CPRs), is thus required ( ).

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) was originally conceptualized in the 1970s ( ). Recent technical developments using two separate x-ray sources ( ), energy-discriminating detectors ( ), and the rapid switching of tube voltages ( ) have led to renewed interest in this concept. Although DECT does not have perfect discriminatory power, because of the spectral overlap of different materials from noise ( ), the added spectral information can theoretically improve the separation of materials composed of elements with larger atomic numbers, such as iodinated contrast medium and bone or calcified plaque ( ). Thus, DECT has the potential to alleviate the fundamental problem of single-energy CTA caused by the wide overlapping attenuation of calcified tissues (bone and calcified atherosclerotic plaque) and contrast medium–enhanced vessels ( ).

The maximum-intensity projection (MIP) of the original 140-kVp data set (a) is shown adjacent to the MIP after calcium suppression (b) . The completely unsuppressed bones in the femurs of (b) (arrows) are due to an artifact caused by the use of a smaller detector for the 80-kVp tube. Although the majority of the bone was suppressed, the residual attenuation due to bone still obscured many vessels on the MIP. Representative samples of 73,602 iodine and 4,143,318 bone voxels were semiautomatically extracted from the data set to generate the histograms of the contrast medium (c) and bone (d) , respectively, shown before and after calcium suppression.

The original 140-kVp images (a) are shown with the calcium maps (b) that display the predicted calcium attenuation. The calcium suppression images (c) were created by replacing only the predicted contribution of calcium attenuation with that of water attenuation.

Images of the left calf of an 80-year-old man with extensive tibioperoneal arterial calcifications before (a–c) and after (d–f) calcium suppression. (a,d) Transverse computed tomographic (CT) images through the proximal calf. (b,e) Curved planar reformations (CPRs) from the popliteal through the posterior tibial arteries, with gauging marks (every 1 cm) at identical positions. (c,f) Maximum-intensity projections (MIPs). Bones have been removed from both data sets for better depiction of vessel wall calcifications. Calcium was suppressed by replacing its predicted density in each voxel with water density (e,f) , except in the transverse image (d) , in which the replacement is air density for illustration purposes. The post-suppression transverse CT image (d) shows complete suppression of arterial wall calcifications in the three calf arteries. Direct comparison of the pre- (b) and post-suppression (e) CPR images shows several inaccurately oversuppressed voxels within the patent vessel lumen, best seen in the popliteal artery. Visual comparison of the MIP images ( c vs f ) nicely demonstrates patent versus occluded flow channels without obscuring calcifications after plaque suppression (f) . The inaccurately oversuppressed voxels result in a loss of small-vessel conspicuity seen in a gastrocnemius branch ( double asterisks in c and f ), the common plantar artery ( single asterisk in c and f ), and communicating branches between the peroneal and posterior tibial arteries ( circles in c and f ). The posterior tibial artery is indicated by the arrow , the peroneal artery by the open arrowhead , and the anterior tibial artery by the solid arrowhead .
