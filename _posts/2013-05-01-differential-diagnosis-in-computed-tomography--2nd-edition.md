_Differential Diagnosis in Computed Tomography_ is designed to be a comprehensive guide to developing differential diagnoses when interpreting computed tomography (CT) examinations. Readers familiar with the previous work of lead author Francis Burgener will recognize the well-illustrated and table-heavy format from his popular Thieme _Differential Diagnosis_ series. As with his other works, Burgener extracts the essential information, organizes it into succinct and easily navigable tables, and illustrates each chapter with a carefully selected array of images. The tables include the pertinent imaging findings as well as clinical and pathologic correlations that help to characterize each disease, thereby narrowing the differential diagnosis.

The chapters are organized by anatomic region, with head, neck, and central nervous system accounting for roughly half the length of the book. However, within each chapter, the information in _Differential Diagnosis in Computed Tomography_ is organized by CT findings such as location, attenuation, configuration/position, enhancement pattern, and other associated findings. This organization system is in keeping with the rest of the _Differential Diagnosis_ series, but is in contrast to most other radiology textbooks, which tend to be organized by disease processes.

This second edition includes updates on the latest CT technology and scanning parameters as well as updating information of staging intra-articular and spinal fractures and evaluating vasculopathies. There are new chapters on calvarial and meningeal lesions. Otherwise, the content and organization is similar to the first edition, so readers satisfied with their first edition purchase may not be compelled to upgrade just yet.

Residents and fellows will benefit greatly by reviewing the text between (or during) case interpretations to help develop their differential diagnoses. More than 2000 high-quality images are included, with helpful legends and annotations that create additional educational value. Even attending radiologists would likely benefit from having a copy available for those occasions when an unusual or indeterminate finding is encountered. The subject matter likely is too advanced for most medical students. Given its comprehensive scope (essentially head to toe), the textbook leverages its heavily tabulated format to remain reasonably concise. However, the size of this textbook does somewhat limit its mobility. _Differential Diagnosis in Computed Tomography_ may not be a “backpack” book (although a Kindle version is available), but it certainly would be an excellent addition to virtually any radiology library or beside any workstation where CT exams are interpreted.
