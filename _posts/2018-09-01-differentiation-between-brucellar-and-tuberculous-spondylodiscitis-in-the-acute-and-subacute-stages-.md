## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to reveal the distinctive features of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for distinguishing brucellar spondylodiscitis (BSD) from tuberculous spondylodiscitis (TSD) in the acute and subacute stages.

## Methods

This study involved 14 patients with BSD and 18 patients with TSD from May 2011 to January 2015. BSD was diagnosed based on ≥1/160 titers of a Brucella agglutination test or isolation of _Brucella_ spp. TSD was diagnosed based on the isolation of tuberculosis bacteria. All patients underwent T1- and T2-weight imaging (T1WI and T2WI) and fat suppression T2WI (FS T2WI). The height and the signal intensity (SI) of the vertebra and intervertebral disc were assessed. The distinctive MRI features were compared using the chi-square test. The SI of the vertebra between BSD and TSD was observed in terms of histogram characteristics of kurtosis, skewness, and percentile (75%–25%) on FS T2WI.

## Results

Twenty-nine (76.3%) vertebrae of BSD were infected throughout the whole vertebra, and 49 (90.7%) vertebrae of TSD were infected near the osseous end plate ( _P_ <  .001). Compared to TSD, the vertebral height of BSD was nearly intact ( _P_ <  .001), owing to the new bone formation in the end plate without vertebral collapse. Furthermore, significant differences in the SI of the vertebra were observed between patients with BSD and TSD in terms of homogeneous characteristics on FS T2WI, that is, kurtosis (BSD vs TSD, 0.107 vs −0.250, _P_ = .023), skewness (BSD vs TSD, −0.021 vs 0.266, _P_ = .017), and percentile (75%–25%) (BSD vs TSD, 54.498 vs 79.399, _P_ = .00049).

## Conclusions

The nearly intact vertebra with homogeneous high signal on FS T2WI was an important MRI feature for distinguishing BSD from TSD in the acute and subacute stages.

## Introduction

Brucellosis is an important systemic zoonotic infection. Having a worldwide distribution, it mainly affects people in developing countries . It is endemic in areas such as the Mediterranean region, the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, Mexico, and parts of Central and South America. It is considered a public health problem in many countries. Brucellosis has variable and nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms. The majority of symptoms are fever, sweat, weakness, anorexia, headache, and backache. Its diagnosis may be difficult because brucellar spondylodiscitis (BSD) may resemble tuberculous spondylodiscitis (TSD) regarding similar clinical presentation and symptom in the acute (<3 months) and subacute (3–12 months) stages . BSD is easy to miss or may be misdiagnosed as TSD. A delayed diagnosis without appropriate treatment in the acute or subacute stages may lead to clinical morbidity and loss of productivity . The clinical differentiation of BSD and TSD is important because the medications used to manage these infections are notably different. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with antibrucellar chemotherapy is known to be an effective treatment, whereas surgical decompression is rarely needed . Therefore, it is essential to screen first, relying on the imaging characteristics to determine whether it is brucellosis.

There are no previous studies differentiating BSD and TSD in the acute and subacute stages. The earliest response to vertebral osteomyelitis is the accumulation of water in the marrow. Early changes in the infected vertebral bodies have been previously observed on conventional T1- and T2-weighted images (T1WI and T2WI) . Fat suppression (FS) T2WI is more sensitive and reliable in the detection of water protons in contrast to T1WI and T2WI . Hence, the aim of our study was to compare the height and signal intensity (SI) of the vertebra and intervertebral disc to distinguish BSD from TSD in the acute and subacute stages using FS T2WI technique.
