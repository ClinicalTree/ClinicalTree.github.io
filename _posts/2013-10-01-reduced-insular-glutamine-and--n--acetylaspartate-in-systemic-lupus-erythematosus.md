## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate for differences in metabolic concentrations and ratios between patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) without (group SLE) and those with neurological symptoms (group NPSLE) compared to a healthy control (group HC) in three normal-appearing brain regions: the frontal white matter, right insula (RI), and occipital gray matter and whether changes in any of the metabolites or metabolic ratios are correlated to disease activity and other clinical parameters.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty patients with SLE (18 women and 2 men, age range 23.4–64.6 years, mean age 43.9 years), 23 NPSLE patients (23 women, age range 23.7–69.8 years, mean age 42.4 years), and 21 HC (19 women and 2 men, age range 21.0–65.7 years, mean age 43.4 years) were included. All subjects had conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging and  1 H single-voxel spectroscopy, clinical assessment, and laboratory testing.

## Results

NPSLE patients had significantly reduced _N_ -acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine compared to HC ( _P_ = .02) and SLE patients ( _P_ = .01) in the RI. Lower glutamine/creatine levels were also detected in RI in both patient groups and in frontal white matter in NPSLE patients compared to HC ( _P_ = .01, _P_ = .02). NAA/Cr ratio in the RI was significantly negatively correlated with the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index ( _r_ = −0.41; _P_ = .008), and patients with active SLE symptoms also had a trend toward lower NAA/creatine ratios (1.02 vs 1.12; _P_ = .07).

## Conclusions

The present data support previous findings of abnormal metabolic changes in normal-appearing regions in the brain of both SLE and NPSLE patients and raise the possibility that especially NAA, glutamine, and glutamate may be additional biomarkers for cerebral disease activity in SLE patients as these early metabolic changes occur in the brain of SLE patients before neurologic and imaging manifestations become apparent.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory, immune-mediated disease that affects 0.1% of the general population. Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) is a severe and life-threatening condition, reported to occur in 25% to 70% of patients with SLE and associated with increased morbidity and mortality . Clinically, NPSLE can present with acute symptoms such as stroke, seizures, or movement disorders, which are usually diagnosed promptly and reliably. However, many individuals with SLE develop a variety of other symptoms, including headaches, psychosis, cognitive dysfunction, depression, or other less specific symptoms, and the diagnosis and attribution to NPSLE are much less certain. The wide variation in NSPLE incidence emphasizes the need for better diagnostic tests. Clinical manifestations of NPSLE include headaches, stroke, myelopathy, seizures, psychosis, confusional states, and cognitive impairment but also peripheral manifestations such as cranial neuropathies and inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathies. Patients with concomitant antiphospholipid antibodies are at additional risk for neuropsychiatric events. Lupus patients are also at increased risk for a wide range of central nervous system (CNS) events related to immunosuppressive therapy, including infection and drug toxicity.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is frequently used to diagnose or exclude main brain alterations and has become part of the routine clinical workup of such alterations . Abnormal conventional MRI findings are common in both SLE and NPSLE patients and range from nonspecific small punctate focal lesions in white matter (WM) (present in the majority of NPSLE patients but not specific) to more severe findings such as cortical atrophy, ventricular dilation, cerebral edema, cerebral infarctions, and intracranial hemorrhage . These findings are attributed to different mechanisms, including thrombosis, vasculopathy, and antibody-mediated neuronal injury .
