## Rationale and Objectives

To compare prospectively 64-detector-row computed tomographic colonography (CTC) after a full-laxative tagging-based preparation (full preparation) with a minimum-laxative tagging-based preparation (minimum preparation) with respect to diagnostic performance in the detection of polyps, tagging quality, and patient acceptance.

## Materials and Methods

Consecutive 101 patients at high risk for developing colorectal cancer were alternately assigned to either a full preparation group (n = 51) or a minimum preparation group (n = 50) for fecal-tagging CTC. The full preparation consisted of administration of 2-L polyethylene glycol solution with 20 mL of sodium diatrizoate for fecal tagging. The minimum preparation consisted of ingestion of a total of 45 mL of sodium diatrizoate during the 3 days before and 10 mL of sodium picosulfate solution the night before CT. Colonoscopy was used as the reference standard. We assessed the accuracy of polyp detection and the tagging quality for each preparation. All patients were given questionnaires related to their acceptance.

## Results

Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for polyps ≥ 6 mm were as follows: full preparation group, 97%, 92%, 88%, and 98%, respectively; minimum preparation group, 88%, 68%, 56%, and 92%, respectively. Average visual subjective tagging scores for the full and minimum preparation groups were 94.6% and 76.1%, respectively ( _P_ < .0001). Minimum preparation was better tolerated than full preparation.

## Conclusion

Although full-laxative and minimum-laxative fecal-tagging CTC yielded an equally high sensitivity in the detection of polyps ≥ 6 mm, the full-laxative fecal-tagging CTC yielded a better specificity than did the minimum-laxative fecal-tagging CTC. Thus, it is desirable to offer patients an option of either full-laxative fecal-tagging CTC for highest diagnostic accuracy and ability to perform a same-day therapeutic colonoscopy without additional bowel preparation, or minimum-laxative fecal-tagging CTC for those unwilling to undergo full preparation but willing to accept moderate decrease in specificity.

Currently, two types of bowel preparation with fecal tagging are used for computed tomographic colonography (CTC) . The first type is designed to reduce the cleansing procedure as much as possible with fecal tagging for improving patient compliance and acceptance of the preparation . The second type is a conventional, full-laxative preparation with fecal tagging for achieving the cleanest possible colon to yield the best results for polyp detection regardless of patients' diet or bowel habits . Although clinical trials have been conducted with each bowel preparation regimen, a single trial comparing these two bowel preparation regimens with fecal tagging on a consecutive cohort of patients has not been reported.

Our purpose in this study was prospectively to compare conventional full-laxative with minimum-laxative fecal-tagging CTC in terms of diagnostic performance in the detection of polyps, tagging quality, and patient acceptance in a consecutive patient cohort using 64-detector-row CT scanning.
