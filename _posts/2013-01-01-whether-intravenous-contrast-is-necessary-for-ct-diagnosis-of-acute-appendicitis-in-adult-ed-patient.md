## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the necessity of intravenous contrast medium for abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) diagnosis of acute appendicitis (APP) among adult patients with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain at emergency department (ED).

## Materials and Methods

ED patients with clinical suspicion of APP from RLQ pain for a period of 8 months were enrolled retrospectively. Both pre- and postintravenous contrast-enhanced CT scans were performed for these patients. The visibility of vermiform appendix and specific CT findings of APP were recorded separately for noncontrast CT (NCT) and contrast-enhanced CT (CCT) images without knowledge of the patient's identity and final diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of CT diagnosis for APP were compared between the two groups. The ease of identifying appendix was also compared.

## Results

Forty-two (42.0%) of the 100 patients (55 males, 45 females; age range, 16–90 years; mean age, 49.3 years) were APP. There was no significant difference for the visibility of appendix (94% vs. 91%; _P_ = .589) and radiological characters between the CCT and NCT groups. There were significant differences between the two groups for sensitivity (100% vs. 90.5%; _P_ = .036), specificity (94.8% vs. 100%; _P_ = .038), PPV (93.3% vs. 100%; _P_ = .021), NPV (100% vs. 93.5%; _P_ = .021), but no significant difference for accuracy (97% vs. 96%; _P_ = 1). The appendix was easier to detect on CCT than NCT images ( _P_ = .013).

## Conclusion

The diagnostic sensitivity of CCT was significantly better than that of NCT. Intravenous contrast administration could also make doctors easier in indentifying appendixes.

Acute appendicitis (APP) remains one of the leading causes of acute abdominal pain requiring surgical treatment in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED), occurring in 27.5% of surgical abdominal emergencies . Unfortunately, timely diagnosis remains clinically challenging, and the correct diagnosis is not made in at least 20% of patients with APP . Delays increase the risk of appendiceal perforation, postoperative complications and medical expenses .

As helical abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) performed in patients with clinically suspected APP has shown high diagnostic accuracy (93% to 98%) and reduction of hospital resource utilization in many previous reports, the use of this imaging modality in diagnosing APP has increased steadily . Various methods to enhance the visibility of CT have been studied, and the protocol with intravenous contrast administration has proven to be an effective technique, which also reduced the negative appendectomy rate . However, with the increasing emphasis on the dose of radiation exposure and the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy or allergic reaction, noncontrast CT is particularly appealing in nowadays' choice of diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to assess the necessity of intravenous contrast medium for CT diagnosis of APP among adult patients at ED.
