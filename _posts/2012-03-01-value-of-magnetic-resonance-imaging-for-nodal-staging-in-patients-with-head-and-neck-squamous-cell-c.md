## Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

## Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CBM disc databases, and other databases were searched for relevant original articles published between January 1990 and January 2011. Meta-analysis methods were used to pool sensitivity and specificity and to construct summary receiver-operating characteristic, and to calculate positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-). We also compared the performance of MRI with other diagnostic methods (positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and ultrasound) by analyzing studies that had also used these diagnostic methods on the same patients.

## Results

Across 16 studies, there was no evidence of publication bias ( _P_ = .15). Sensitivity and specificity of MRI for cervical lymph node status in patients with HNSCC across all studies were 76% (95% CI: 70%–82%) and 86% (95% CI: 73%–93%), respectively. Overall, Positive likelihood ratios was 5.47 (95% CI: 2.69–11.11) and positive negative likelihood ratios was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.21–0.36), respectively. The comparison of MRI performance with that of other diagnostic tools (positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and ultrasound) suggested no major differences against any of these methods. The Subgroup by using diffusion-weighted imaging had higher pooled sensitivity (0.86, 95% CI 0.78–0.92) than the subgroup without diffusion-weighted imaging.

## Conclusion

MRI has good diagnostic performance in the overall pretreatment evaluation of node staging with HNSCC. A limited number of small studies suggest DWI is superior to conventional imaging for nodal staging of HNSCC.

Lymphatic metastasis is an important prognostic factor in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) . Therefore, accurate assessment of the lymph node status is important for the choice of treatment. Lymph node staging by physical examination is not accurate in discriminating metastatic from benign lymph nodes. Even in superficial areas such as the cervical regions, a physical evaluation of lymph nodes cannot reliably detect metastases . Thus, imaging techniques are often used to enhance the preoperative assessment of cervical lymph node status .

Radiological imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET), ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used to support treatment decisions when an unexpected lymph node metastasis is detected on the opposite side in the neck or when it is detected on the ipsilateral side where it is not suspected. Compared to US, CT and MRI are more commonly used to detect cervical lymph node metastases. The main advantage of CT and MRI are the lower interobserver variation, and these techniques are, in general, less time consuming. Compared with PET, PET has potential disadvantages. First, nodal necrosis may cause false-negative findings on PET because of the low glycolytic activity of the necrotic material. Second, false-positive PET results may be caused by inflammatory processes in benign lymph nodes. However, the overall diagnostic accuracy of CT and MRI for detecting node metastases in the HNSCC is insufficient ; sensitivities range from 14% to 80% for CT and from 29% to 85% for MRI , and specificities range from 80% to 100% for both CT and MRI using pathology as the reference standard. Furthermore, a wide variation in patient population, imaging techniques, study design, and results exists. These factors make it difficult for workers in this field to know the exact diagnostic value of these imaging modalities. Thus, whether these imaging techniques perform well enough and whether one modality is superior to others, need answers.
