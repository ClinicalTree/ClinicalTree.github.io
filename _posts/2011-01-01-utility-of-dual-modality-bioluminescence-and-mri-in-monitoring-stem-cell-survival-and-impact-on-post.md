## Rationale and Objectives

Firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter gene is an authentic marker for surviving stem cells. However, it is unable to visualize the intramyocardial delivery of stem cells or their impact on cardiac function. The investigators demonstrate that bioluminescence imaging (BLI) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows better assessment of cell delivery and the impact on post–myocardial infarction remodeling.

## Materials and Methods

Murine embryonic stem cells (0.3 million) were double-labeled with Fluc and superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and injected into the infarct border zone of athymic rat hearts. BLI and MRI were performed serially up to 2 months after injection, followed by immunohistochemistry.

## Results

Dual-modality imaging was able to verify the initial intramyocardial delivery of the cells and their survival status. Over time, BLI signal increased in seven of nine hearts and disappeared in the other two hearts. The divergence of BLI signal over time was supported by MRI findings. Left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening estimated by MRI suggested that cell engraftment mediated a positive impact on post–myocardial infarction remodeling. Two months after intramyocardial injection, superparamagnetic iron oxide–associated signals facilitated the localization of the injection site.

## Conclusions

Dual-modality imaging has the unique ability to monitor cell delivery, survival status, graft morphology, and impact on post–myocardial infarction remodeling.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–based tracking of stem cells grafted in the heart is especially challenging in rodent models. Cardiac and respiration motion introduce significant artifacts, particularly in the setting of their high heart rates. Electrocardiographically gated MRI has been successful in visualizing superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particle–labeled stem cells grafted in the myocardium of mouse and rat models . However, later studies revealed that the SPIO-MRI method was insensitive to monitor cell survival over time . In comparison, approaches using reporter genes to “label” stem cells have shown advantages in tracking cell survival and proliferation in the heart . Compared to other reporter genes, the firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter combined with bioluminescence imaging (BLI) provides a sensitive, simple, and inexpensive method for stem cell tracking in small animals. Although it is highly sensitive, BLI is poor in resolving the signal in a tomographic fashion. In the past, BLI and MRI were examined for monitoring stem cell interventions in rodent models of myocardial infarction (MI) . However, the unique strength of combining the two modalities to track the same population of stem cells over time has not been demonstrated.

To visualize the stem cells by both BLI and MRI, we used a double-labeling strategy in which Fluc-expressing murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were labeled with SPIO particles. Murine ESCs were rejected in immune competent allogeneic mice . Therefore, immune-deficient or syngenic animals must be used to achieve long-term monitoring of ESC survival by BLI. The above consideration combined with our intention to generate a reperfused MI model led us to choose athymic nude rats, which are suitable for demonstrating the utility of dual-modality imaging. Indeed, the MI model in nude rats has been used to receive stem cells of human and mouse origin in many previous studies .
