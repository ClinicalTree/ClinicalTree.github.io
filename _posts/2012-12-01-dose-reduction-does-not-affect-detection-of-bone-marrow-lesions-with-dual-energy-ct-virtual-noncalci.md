## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate if a dose-reduced, dose-neutral dual-energy computed tomographic (CT) virtual noncalcium technique can equally detect posttraumatic bone marrow lesions (BMLs) of the knee.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty patients underwent DE CT imaging with either a standard dose (group A) or a dose equal to that of a single-energy CT scan (group B) (28% dose reduction) and magnetic resonance imaging for knee trauma workup. Calcium was virtually subtracted from the images. Two radiologists rated the presence of abnormal soft tissue–like attenuation in the bone marrow in a total of 12 femoral and tibial regions and performed Hounsfield unit measurements thereafter. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was used for four-point rating scores and Hounsfield unit measurements. Fractures were classified.

## Results

Magnetic resonance imaging depicted 170 BMLs (35 femoral, 135 tibial). Mean age, number of fractures, attenuation values and number of regions with BMLs were not significantly different between the groups. Visual rating revealed overall areas under the curves of 0.983 and 0.979 for observers 1 and 2, respectively. Visual judgment was superior to attenuation measurements for femoral regions regardless of the dose applied. Analysis of variance of all CT values revealed a significant influence for the presence of edema ( _P_ < .001) but no differences for the radiation dose used ( _P_ = .424). Interobserver agreement was excellent (κ = 0.944).

## Conclusions

Dose reduction does not affect the detectability of posttraumatic BMLs with a dual-energy CT virtual noncalcium technique, thereby providing potential additional information compared with single-energy CT imaging without additional radiation dose.

The introduction of dual-source spiral computed tomographic (CT) scanners has revived dual-energy (DE) CT imaging, thereby providing new applications such as the virtual unenhanced scanning, in which iodine can be virtually removed from a contrast-enhanced CT examination . This technique was recently adopted to virtually subtract calcium from cancellous bone to allow bone marrow assessment . This “virtual noncalcium” (VNCa) technique was proven in a feasibility study to detect posttraumatic bone bruises of the knee with computed tomography, an imaging diagnosis associated solely with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) thus far . However, additional information was obtained by raising the radiation dose to approximately 28% that used for a single-energy CT knee scan . The routine application of this technique is problematic because of this drawback. However, if this examination were feasible at a dose equal to that of single-energy CT imaging without losing diagnostic image quality, the additional knowledge about the presence and the distribution pattern of bone marrow lesions might facilitate further patient management .

Thus, it was our aim to investigate the diagnostic performance regarding the detectability of posttraumatic bone marrow lesions of the knee with a dose-reduced, dose-neutral application compared with the established DE CT VNCa protocol, with MRI as the standard of reference.
