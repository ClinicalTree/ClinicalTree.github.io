This report summarizes the Joint FDA-MIPS Workshop on Methods for the Evaluation of Imaging and Computer-Assist Devices. The purpose of the workshop was to gather information on the current state of the science and facilitate consensus development on statistical methods and study designs for the evaluation of imaging devices to support US Food and Drug Administration submissions. Additionally, participants expected to identify gaps in knowledge and unmet needs that should be addressed in future research. This summary is intended to document the topics that were discussed at the meeting and disseminate the lessons that have been learned through past studies of imaging and computer-aided detection and diagnosis device performance.

In this report, we summarize the Joint FDA-MIPS Workshop on Methods for the Evaluation of Imaging and Computer-Assist Devices, held on July 14, 2010. The purpose of this workshop was to gather information and facilitate consensus on the current state of the science of statistical methods and study designs for the evaluation of imaging devices and computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems in the hands of clinicians, the image readers, to support US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions. We hope that this summary serves as a stand-alone starting point and overview for investigators who are interested in reader studies evaluating imaging technology to support FDA submissions.

Additionally, we identified gaps in knowledge and unmet needs that should be addressed in future research. This document summarizes the topics that were discussed and the lessons learned from past studies of readers using imaging devices and CAD systems. Our primary goal is to improve device evaluations submitted to the FDA, that is, to make them more meaningful and powerful, thereby reducing the resources required of the FDA and industry to make important and clinically useful devices and tools available for improved patient care.

The workshop invitations targeted a multidisciplinary group of leaders in the field of medical imaging evaluation who have somehow been involved in the FDA approval and clearance of imaging devices: statisticians, clinicians, imaging physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists from government, academia, and industry. All told, there were 22 attendees from academia, 11 from industry, 31 from the FDA, five from other government agencies including the National Institutes of Health, and 12 clinicians. Most attendees had either attended or participated in an FDA advisory panel meeting to judge the safety and effectiveness of an imaging device seeking premarket approval.

The meeting was divided into three sessions, each with two invited presenters followed by a panel that included an additional invited expert in the field. The first session was “Statistical Perspectives,” with Alicia Toledano, ScD (Statistics Collaborative, Inc), and Nancy Obuchowski, PhD (Cleveland Clinic Foundation), as the key presenters and Berkman Sahiner, PhD (FDA), on the panel. The second session was “Clinical Perspectives,” with Carl D’Orsi, MD (Emory University), and Margarita Zuley, MD (University of Pittsburgh), as key presenters and Barbara McNeil, MD, PhD (Harvard Medical School), as the third member on the panel. The final session was “Developer Perspectives,” with Heang-Ping Chan, PhD (University of Michigan), and Maryellen Giger, PhD (University of Chicago), as key presenters and David Gur, ScD (University of Pittsburgh), on the panel. The sessions were moderated by Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD (University of Arizona), and Lori Dodd, PhD (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases), who also provided a summary titled “State of Consensus and Plans for the Future” at the end of the meeting. Kyle Myers, PhD, and Brandon Gallas, PhD, of the FDA organized and provided the introductory background and guidance for the workshop.

Because the main focus of the workshop was the FDA approval and clearance of imaging devices, the views expressed there may have been limited or biased. The discussions at this workshop were focused on getting imaging devices approved and did not define what is or is not a valuable contribution to the scientific literature. Given the high stakes, manufacturers are sometimes reluctant to use cutting-edge study designs and analyses, preferring more established and traditional designs and analyses. In this setting, manufacturers typically report sensitivity and specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under ROC curves (AUCs). However, they are not sure which of these limited measures is the “right” one (the one that will get their devices approved) and which measure they should use to size their studies. Manufacturers also often struggle to balance study biases against study burden (complexity, time, and costs) and clinical reality against experimental tractability and abstraction.
