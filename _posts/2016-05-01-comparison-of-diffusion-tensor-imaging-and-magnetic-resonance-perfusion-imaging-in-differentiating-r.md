## Rationale and Objectives

To compare differences in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging characteristics of recurrent neoplasm and radiation necrosis in patients with brain tumors previously treated with radiotherapy with or without surgery and chemotherapy.

## Materials and Methods

Patients with a history of brain neoplasm previously treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy and surgery who developed a new enhancing lesion on posttreatment surveillance MRI were enrolled. DSC perfusion MRI and DTI were performed. Region of interest cursors were manually drawn in the contrast-enhancing lesions, in the perilesional white matter edema, and in the contralateral normal-appearing frontal lobe white matter. DTI and DSC perfusion MR indices were compared in recurrent tumor versus radiation necrosis.

## Results

Twenty-two patients with 24 lesions were included. Sixteen (67%) lesions were placed into the recurrent neoplasm group and eight (33%) lesions were placed into the radiation necrosis group using biopsy results as the gold standard in all but three patients. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient values, mean parallel eigenvalues, and mean perpendicular eigenvalues in the contrast-enhancing lesion were significantly lower, and relative cerebral blood volume was significantly higher for the recurrent neoplasm group compared to the radiation necrosis group ( _P_ < 0.01, _P_ = 0.03, _P_ < 0.01, and _P_ < 0.01, respectively).

## Conclusions

The combined assessment of DTI and DSC MR perfusion properties of new contrast-enhancing lesions is helpful in distinguishing recurrent neoplasm from radiation necrosis in patients with a history of brain neoplasm previously treated with radiotherapy with or without surgery and chemotherapy.

## Introduction

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not reliable in distinguishing radiation necrosis from recurrent brain neoplasm in patients with brain tumors previously treated with radiation therapy and surgery . Stereotactic biopsy and resection remain the most reliable methods for the classification of enhancing lesions that develop in the posttreatment period . In recent years, dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced (DSC) MR perfusion imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have been used to evaluate posttreatment brain tumor patients. Multiple studies have shown significantly higher relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in the contrast-enhancing lesions of patients with recurrent tumor compared to those of patients with radiation necrosis . Whereas some studies have shown enhancing lesion apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values or ratios to be lower in recurrent neoplasms as opposed to radiation necrosis , other studies have shown contradictory findings . Few studies have published findings specifically examining the DTI characteristics (fractional anisotropy \[FA\], eigenvalues) of these lesions .

Our study prospectively analyzes both DSC MR perfusion and DTI characteristics of new enhancing lesions in patients with brain tumors previously treated with radiation therapy with or without surgery and chemotherapy.
