## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiac computed tomography is increasingly being used to assess the degree of stenosis in coronary arteries. It has been shown in multiple studies to have high negative predictive value for obstructive disease compared to invasive cardiac catheterization (ICA). However, calcified segments are interpreted differently in each study. The aim of this study was to examine the association of calcified plaques on multi–detector row cardiac computed tomography (MDCT) with the degree of stenosis on ICA.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 129 consecutive patients who underwent coronary evaluation on MDCT and also underwent ICA within 1 month of MDCT were included in the study. Each segment in the coronary artery was classified as mixed, calcified, or noncalcified. All segments with calcified plaque were evaluated, further classifying them as mild, moderate, or severe, and obstructive disease on ICA was used as the reference standard, in a blinded fashion.

## Results

The average age of the patients was 60.8 ± 9.5 years. A total of 379 calcified segments were included in the study. Among these segments, 363 (95.8%) were found to be nonobstructive (<70% stenosis) on ICA. Calcifications were categorized as mild, moderate, and severe in 283 (74.7%), 58 (15.3%), and 38 (10.0%) segments, respectively. When calcium was incomplete in the cross-section of the lumen (mild or moderate calcification), 98.5% of these segments (336 of 341) were associated with nonobstructive disease, decreasing to 71% with severe calcification.

## Conclusion

Calcified plaques seen on MDCT were commonly associated with nonobstructive disease on invasive angiography. Increasing focal calcification increased the likelihood of obstructive disease, but only 29% of severe segments were associated with significant obstructive disease.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality around the world, often leading to myocardial infarction or death. Invasive cardiac catheterization (ICA) is currently the gold standard in diagnosing CAD but is insensitive in detecting calcified plaques . Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) is also used in assessing the degree of stenosis and is able to assess coronary plaque composition to a greater degree than ICA. In multiple studies, CCT has been shown to have high negative predictive value compared to ICA . Computed tomography (CT) is able to provide risk stratification more accurately than traditional risk factor assessment . It is used commonly to assess coronary artery calcium (CAC) as a predictor of coronary atherosclerosis burden and cardiovascular risk . In this study, we looked at the association of calcified plaques on multi–detector row CCT (MDCT) with the degree of stenosis on ICA. We sought to specifically evaluate the degree of stenosis associated with calcified segments and validate the fact that a calcified segment is not necessarily obstructive, as seen at times on ICA.

## Materials and methods

## Study Population

We initially included 145 patients from those who underwent catheterization and CCT within 1 month. Of this subset of 145 initially reviewed for our study, 129 were found to have calcifications in their coronary arteries on MDCT and were included for further analysis in the cohort.
