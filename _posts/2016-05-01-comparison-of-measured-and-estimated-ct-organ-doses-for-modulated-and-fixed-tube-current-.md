## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the directly measured and the estimated computed tomography (CT) organ doses obtained from commercial radiation dose-tracking (RDT) software for CT performed with modulated tube current or automatic exposure control (AEC) technique and fixed tube current (mAs).

## Materials and Methods

With the institutional review board (IRB) approval, the ionization chambers were surgically implanted in a human cadaver (88 years old, male, 68 kg) in six locations such as liver, stomach, colon, left kidney, small intestine, and urinary bladder. The cadaver was scanned with routine abdomen pelvis protocol on a 128-slice, dual-source multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanner using both AEC and fixed mAs. The effective and quality reference mAs of 100, 200, and 300 were used for AEC and fixed mAs, respectively. Scanning was repeated three times for each setting, and measured and estimated organ doses (from RDT software) were recorded (N = 3\*3\*2 = 18).

## Results

Mean CTDI  vol for AEC and fixed mAs were 4, 8, 13 mGy and 7, 14, 21 mGy, respectively. The most estimated organ doses were significantly greater ( _P_ < 0.01) than the measured organ doses for both AEC and fixed mAs. At AEC, the mean estimated organ doses (for six organs) were 14.7 mGy compared to mean measured organ doses of 12.3 mGy. Similarly, at fixed mAs, the mean estimated organ doses (for six organs) were 24 mGy compared to measured organ doses of 22.3 mGy. The differences among the measured and estimated organ doses were higher for AEC technique compared to the fixed mAs for most organs ( _P_ < 0.01).

## Conclusions

The most CT organ doses estimated from RDT software are greater compared to directly measured organ doses, particularly when AEC technique is used for CT scanning.

## Introduction

Current computed tomography (CT) dose metrics, CT dose index volume (CTDI  vol ), and dose length product (DLP) represent scanner output radiation doses to standardized 16- or 32-cm phantoms . These dose descriptors do not represent actual patient-absorbed doses because they are estimated using phantoms made up of uniform attenuation synthetic materials with two fixed sizes. On the other hand, human bodies are heterogeneous in tissue compositions, and their cross-sectional diameter covers a large range of values . Size-specific dose estimates (SSDE) has been recently proposed by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) in an effort to adapt CTDI  vol to patients' cross-sectional size in the body region being imaged .

Prior studies have used sophisticated mathematical models based on Monte Carlo simulation techniques to estimate organ doses . These techniques involve the use of advanced Monte Carlo simulations and voxelized patient models, which can take several hours of computations to estimate organ doses. Recently introduced commercial radiation dose-tracking (RDT) software (eXposure, Bayer Healthcare, Leverkusen, Germany) provides estimates of organ doses for CT examinations using precalculated organ dose data from first-generation phantoms, whereas other tools (such as VirtualDose  TM , Virtual Phantoms Inc., Albany, NY) employ anatomically realistic family of phantoms. Rough organ doses can also be obtained using ImPACT dosimetry spreadsheet (freely available at  www.ImPACTscan.org ), which uses precalculated Monte Carlo datasets obtained for multiple different scanner models using a simulated hermaphroditic phantom with mathematically modeled organs and tissues . These software tools must be benchmarked against experimental measurements for organ doses that are difficult to perform.
