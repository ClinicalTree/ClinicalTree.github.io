## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare effective radiation doses between prospective and retrospective electrocardiographic gating during coronary computed tomographic angiography for coronary artery bypass grafting evaluation.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty consecutive coronary computed tomographic angiographic exams for coronary artery bypass grafting evaluation, 25 prospectively gated and 25 retrospectively gated, were reviewed from January 8, 2008, to June 16, 2009. Body mass index and image quality were also compared between the two groups. To minimize the potential bias introduced by differences in torso length, the effective radiation dose from each exam was measured and normalized to a 24-cm _z_ -axis scan length for all patients. Pooled _t_ tests were used to compare the prospectively and retrospectively gated groups.

## Results

The average effective doses delivered in the retrospective and prospective groups were 40.8 mSv (standard error \[SE\], 1.8 mSv) and 8.6 mSv (SE, 0.7 mSv), respectively. When normalized to the average _z_ -axis scan length of 24 cm, the effective dose in the retrospective group, 38.4 mSv (SE, 1.3 mSv), was still >4 times greater than that in the prospective group, 9.1 mSv (SE, 0.7 mSv) ( _P_ < .0001). There was no significant difference in body mass index or image quality between the groups.

## Conclusions

Effective radiation dose in coronary computed tomographic angiography for coronary artery bypass grafting evaluation is very high because of long scan lengths. Prospective electrocardiographic gating significantly reduces effective radiation dose by an average of 76% compared to retrospectively gated scans (9.1 vs 38.4 mSv). In the coronary artery bypass grafting population, prospective electrocardiographic gating should be used whenever ventricular functional assessment is not required.

Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CCTA) has become an increasingly popular modality for the noninvasive evaluation of coronary anatomy and pathology. CCTA is an accurate method for the noninvasive evaluation of coronary vasculature, with a high negative predictive value for obstructive coronary disease . Risks from ionizing radiation are well documented, and recent innovations have been developed to reduce patient dose. Traditional retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG) gating is performed using continuous radiation and data acquisition and retrospective selection of relevant data for image reconstruction . Prospective ECG gating is a newer technique using the prediction of R-wave timing to allow for intermittent data acquisition alternating with table movement . Typically, prospective gating allows for the x-ray beam to be “on” for approximately 26% of every other R-R interval, resulting in a 77% average dose reduction .

Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of CCTA in patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), with 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity for the detection of obstructive bypass graft disease . Despite this diagnostic performance, CCTA is not without risks. CABG patients require a longer _z_ -axis scan length, and therefore higher radiation dose, to image the entire graft length. For example, evaluation of a left internal mammary artery graft requires images from the thoracic inlet to the diaphragm, whereas a native heart only requires images from the main pulmonary artery to the diaphragm. Our hypothesis was that CABG patients undergoing CCTA receive a significantly increased radiation dose, making traditional retrospective ECG gating potentially unwarranted.
