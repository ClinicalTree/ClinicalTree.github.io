## Rationale and Objectives

To define high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features of lung cancers detected by computed tomography (CT) screening according to histopathology and prognosis.

## Methods and Materials

Tumor size, CT value, morphology, and tumor volume doubling time (TVDT) were determined for 10 atypical adenomatous hyperplasias (AAH) and 50 lung cancers followed between 1996 and 1998 to 2007.

## Results

For the 10 AAHs, the density less than −500 HU in all lesions (mean, −654 HU) and the size was up to 14 mm (mean, 9 mm); all patients remain alive. Focal bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas (BAC) were denser (mean, −537 HU) than AAH and mostly less dense than −350 HU; all patients remain alive. All 22 adenocarcinomas (ADC) were denser than −450 HU (mean, −186 HU); 6 were problematic and measured >−150HU and >10 mm or had >10 mm of central denser zone (CDZ) (partly solid tumors) or tumor size (solid tumor). Two of four squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) measuring 15 and 10 mm, respectively, were problematic. Two patients with small-cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) measuring 15 and 23 mm, respectively, remain alive. AAH, BAC, ADC, and SCC lesions were in general polygonal in shape. SCLC lesions appeared as round nodules with excrescence. The mean TVDT for AAH, BAC, ADC, SCC, and SCLC was 1278, 557, 466, 212, and 103 days, respectively.

## Conclusion

The CT features reflected tumor aggressiveness. Non-SCLC lesions of >−150HU and >10 mm (or >−100HU and >10 mm for the solid portion of the tumor) are associated with unfavorable prognosis. Timely interventions should be undertaken before problematic increase in number of cases.

Lung cancer is currently the leading cause of cancer death in the United States; 215,020 cases of lung cancer are expected to be newly diagnosed and 161,840 patients will die from it in 2008 . This poor prognosis appears to reflect a small number of patients who are detected and treated at an early, curable stage . Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening is effective in detecting peripheral small lung nodules . To translate early detection of lesions into true improvement of treatment outcome and prognosis, we need to establish an effective management strategy for small nodules by enhancing our understanding and interpretation of high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings. The aim of any such strategy should include the avoidance of both unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures and treatment of indolent lesions and avoidance of underdiagnosis or delay in initiating treatment for genuine lung cancer .

We conducted a trial of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer between 1996 and 1998 . We report in this article the HRCT features of lung cancer found in the program, according to histopathology and prognosis of patients. This information would help radiologists in making meaningful workup examinations of HRCT scans.
