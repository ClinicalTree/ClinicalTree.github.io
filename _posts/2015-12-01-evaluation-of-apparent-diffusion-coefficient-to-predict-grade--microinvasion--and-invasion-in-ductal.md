## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the role of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in distinguishing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) grades and identifying microinvasive and/or invasive disease in the preoperative evaluation of patients with core biopsy-proven DCIS.

## Materials and Methods

Research Ethics Board-approved study with informed consent from 81 women (age, 36–84 years) scheduled for core-biopsy with results of 82 noninvasive breast carcinomas. All patients were assessed preoperatively by diffusion sequence in addition to contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Lesion morphology and ADC values were recorded. The Kruskal–Wallis or one-way analysis of variance test and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to study the association between ADC and MRI lesion characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the ability of ADC to predict the presence of invasion.

## Results

Surgical pathology demonstrated associated invasive cancer in 26.8%, microinvasion in 14.6%, and pure DCIS in 58.5%. The minimum regions of interest (ROI)–based ADC was significantly different among the following three groups ( _P_ < .001, Kruskal–Wallis test): 0.98 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s ± 0.25 for pure DCIS, 0.82 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s ± 0.20 for DCIS with microinvasion, and 0.71 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s ± 0.27 for DCIS with invasive disease. Based on logistic regression analysis, the minimum ROI-based ADC of 0.56 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s was a significant predictor for invasive disease (odds ratio = 0.02, 95% confidence interval \[0.002, 0.207\], _P_ = .001). Regardless of the field strength (1.5 vs. 3.0 T) ADC values of high-grade and non–high-grade DCIS were not significantly different.

## Conclusions

Pure DCIS had the highest “ROI-based” ADC measured using 1.5 T or 3.0 T. The ADC was able to identify microinvasion or invasive cancer in biopsy-proven DCIS lesions but not to distinguish the DCIS grades.

Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is a preinvasive neoplasm characterized by a proliferation of malignant ductal epithelial cells that are confined within the basement membrane of preexisting duct and/or lobular units of the breast . Since the early 1980s, the prevalence of DCIS has been rising as a result of the adoption of widespread mammographic screening for breast cancer and the advances in mammographic techniques, image processing, and interpretation of digital imaging .

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been useful in the preoperative setting of invasive breast cancer . Specifically, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI has shown strong capability in the detection of invasive breast cancer with a sensitivity approaching 100% . The reported sensitivity of DCIS detection on MRI ranges from 77% to 96%, being largely impeded by challenges in distinguishing images suggestive of in situ cancer from benign and atypical proliferative processes, thus resulting in a higher false positive rate .

(b) Dynamic contrast-enhanced tridimensional axial T1-weighted MR image with fat suppression obtained on the first minute after intravascular contrast administration and colorized maps using Aegis Breast 3.0 (Sentinelle Medical Inc, Toronto, ON) demonstrates segmental distribution and heterogeneous pattern of internal enhancement with a tiny area of wash-out ( red color ) and overall type 2 morphology curve of enhancement (not shown on the images). (c) The ADC map obtained using four b-values (50, 300, 700, and 1000 sec/mm 2 per axis) shows three distinct areas of DCIS. The regions of interest (ROI) in the figure demonstrate minimum, maximum, and mean apparent dynamic coefficient (ADC) values; the minimum ADC values was used in the “ROI-based” ADC measurement.
