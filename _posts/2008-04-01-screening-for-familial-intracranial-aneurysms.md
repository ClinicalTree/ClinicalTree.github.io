## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the potential benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

## Materials and Methods

Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing magnetic resonance (MR) angiography screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms to no screening in family members of patients with aneurysmal SAH. Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms was determined according to patient age and aneurysm size and location. Cohort age was taken as 40 years.

## Results

In family members with two or more affected first-degree relatives, screening compared with no screening had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). With screening, life expectancy increased from 39.44 years to 39.55 years. The ICER of screening was >$50,000 per QALY if age at screening was ≥50 years. In family members with one affected first-degree relative, screening compared with no screening had an ICER of $56,500 per QALY.

## Conclusions

The results suggest that MR angiography screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members with two or more affected first-degree relatives is cost-effective. The benefit and cost-effectiveness are dependent on age at screening.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms affects up to 2%–4% of the population ( ). Family members with one or more first-degree relatives with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have a higher relative risk of harboring an unruptured intracranial aneurysm than the general population ( ). In family members with only one affected first-degree relative, the risk of harboring an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is approximately 4%. Family members with two or more affected first-degree relatives have an approximately 8% risk of harboring an unruptured intracranial aneurysm. The management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms depends on the natural history of these lesions and on morbidity and mortality rates associated with their repair. In 2003, the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) investigators reported prospective data on the natural history and treatment outcomes of unruptured intracranial aneurysms ( ). Aneurysm rupture rates varied depending on aneurysm size and location and treatment outcomes depended on patient age and aneurysm size and location ( ).

Recommendations regarding screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members with one or more affected first-degree relatives are controversial ( ). In 2000, a task force of the Stroke Council of the American Heart Association published recommendations for the management of patients with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm ( ). They concluded that screening in these populations should be considered on an individual basis. Previous decision analyses ( ) showed that there was no benefit of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in these populations with the assumption that all detected aneurysms were surgically treated. Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms should be determined based on the natural history of these lesions and on morbidity and mortality rates associated with their repair. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the potential benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members of patients with aneurysmal SAH, incorporating the results of the prospective ISUIA ( ).
