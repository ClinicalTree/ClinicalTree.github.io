## Rationale and Objectives

We have developed a new contrast enhancement protocol for subtraction coronary computed tomography (SCCTA) requiring a short breath-holding time. In the protocol, test and main boluses were sequentially and automatically injected, and correct timings for pre-contrast and contrast-enhanced scans for main bolus were automatically determined only by the test bolus tracking. Combined with a fixed short main bolus injection for 7 seconds, the breath-holding time was shortened as possible. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether use of this new protocol produced adequate quality images, taking into account calcified lesions and in-stent lumens.

## Materials and Methods

Patients ( _n_ = 127) with calcium scores of >400 Agatston units or a history of stent placement were enrolled. Breath-holding times were recorded, and image quality was visually evaluated by two observers.

## Results

The mean ± standard deviation breath-holding time was 13.2 ± 0.6 seconds. The mean ± SD computed tomography (CT) number of coronary arteries for the pre-contrast scan was sufficiently low \[99.2 ± 32.2 Hounsfield units (HU)\] and, simultaneously, that for SCCTA was 367.0 ± 77.2 HU. The rate of segments evaluated as unreadable was sufficiently low (3.8%).

## Conclusions

Use of the SCCTA protocol was efficient and allowed for a shorter breath-holding time and adequate diagnostic accuracy of SCCTA images, including images of calcified and stent implantation segments.

## Introduction

Subtraction coronary computed tomography angiography (SCCTA) using a 320-detector row computed tomography (CT) scanner was recently developed. This effective method allows calcium to be subtracted from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images, providing improved diagnostic accuracy over conventional CCTA in patients with severe coronary artery calcification and stent . SCCTA uses two CCTA datasets collected pre-contrast and after contrast enhancement. Two types of acquisition protocols have been proposed to acquire the required datasets: the single breath-hold protocol and the two breath-hold protocol. A study by Yoshioka et al. reported that the image quality score using the single breath-hold method was significantly greater than that using the two breath-hold method. Moreover, Tanaka et al. indicated that compared to conventional CCTA, SCCTA performed with the single breath-hold method improved diagnostic accuracy, with SCCTA yielding a significantly reduced number of nondiagnostic segments. Although the breath-holding times (20–40 seconds) of this single breath-hold method has been shortened to approximately 18 seconds using the test bolus method, which enables the prediction of the peak enhancement time by evaluating the enhancement curve of the test bolus , the shortened breath-holding time remains to be problematic for some patients who cannot hold their breath for such a long time.

Furthermore, the operation of the test bolus method is complex and time-consuming as the operator has to run an independent scan plan for monitoring scans, evaluate the peak enhancement time, and then set the time parameter for the main bolus scan plan.
