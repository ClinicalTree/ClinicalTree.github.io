## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in eutrophic and obese adolescents with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and its relationship to insulin resistance and other potential biomarkers.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 50 adolescents (aged 11–17 years), including 24 obese and 26 eutrophic adolescents, were evaluated using MRI exams for NAFLD diagnosis. Blood analysis was performed to measure glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-gt, and C-reactive protein. The Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) index was also calculated. Laboratory test results and anthropometric assessment were statistically analyzed to determine potential correlation with NAFLD prevalence.

## Results

The prevalence of NAFLD among the obese was significantly higher (83.3%; CI 95: 64.5–94.5%) than that of the eutrophic group (19.2%; CI 95: 7.4–37.6%). In multivariate analysis, only HOMA-IR was an independent risk factor for diagnosis NAFLD using MRI. Compared to eutrophic adolescents, the obese adolescents had significantly higher levels for all parameters measured except for total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which were significantly lower.

## Conclusion

The prevalence of NAFLD was 19.2% among eutrophic patients and 83.3% among obese patients. Only HOMA-IR was determined to be an independent risk factor for NAFLD.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a subset of hepatic steatosis, was first described in adult patients in 1980 by Ludwig et al. as a clinicopathologic condition that presents histology findings that correspond with alcoholic hepatitis, but in people who do not drink . Cases of NAFLD that can progress to its most severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, have risen drastically in the United States, with estimates of 80–100 million Americans currently being affected . In Europe, growth in the percentage of the population afflicted with NAFLD has grown by 10–40% in the past 10 years .Geographically, NAFLD prevalence is particularly high in the United States .

Recent studies have shown an association between NAFLD and childhood obesity , with estimated prevalence rates being lower than 10% for the general population, but 70–75% for the obese juvenile population .
