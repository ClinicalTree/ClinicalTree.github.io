## Rationale and Objectives

We have developed a microwave tomography system for experimental breast imaging.

## Materials and Methods

In this article, we illustrate a strategy for optimizing the coupling liquid for the antenna array based on in vivo measurement data. We present representative phantom experiments to illustrate the imaging system’s ability to recover accurate property distributions over the range of dielectric properties expected to be encountered clinically. To demonstrate clinical feasibility and assess the microwave properties of the normal breast in vivo, we summarize our initial experience with microwave breast exams of 43 women with negative mammography according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS 1).

## Results

The clinical results show a high degree of bilateral symmetry in the whole breast average microwave properties. Focal assessments of microwave properties are associated with breast tissue composition evaluated through radiographic density categorization verified through magnetic resonance image correlation in selected cases. Specifically, both whole-breast average and local microwave properties increase with increasing radiographic density, in which the latter exhibits a more substantial rise.

## Conclusion

These findings support our hypothesis that water content variations in the breast play an influential role in dictating the overall dielectric property distributions and indicate that the microwave properties in the breast are more heterogeneous than previously believed based on ex vivo property measurements reported in the literature.

In 2004 alone, more than 200,000 new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed in the United States, with roughly 40,000 women dying from the disease, making breast cancer the second largest cause of female cancer deaths in the United States ( ). There have been numerous reports demonstrating that early detection is the single most significant predictor of long-term survival ( ); therefore, improvements in detection may help to reduce the high mortality rates that exist. Mammography is the front-line screening modality, but its weaknesses in terms of sensitivity and specificity are well documented ( ). Although magnetic resonance (MR) and ultrasound are used primarily in a diagnostic setting, there is room for improvement in differential diagnosis as well.

Over the past decade, there has been a steady increase in the interest in using microwave imaging as a way of detecting breast cancers. Ex vivo studies have indicated that there is significant contrast in the dielectric properties of normal and malignant breast tissue ( ). However, it is well known that the breast is a heterogeneous organ whose composition varies significantly depending on a variety of factors ( ). For example, Woodard and White ( ) have shown that the mammary glands typically contain significantly more water than adipose tissue. Thus fibroglandular breast tissue would be expected to have higher dielectric properties than fat, but with properties that are still lower than high water-content tissues. Further, studies have shown that the amount of fibroglandular tissue can vary widely from fattier breasts (with very little) to dense breast (with substantially larger proportions), suggesting that the baseline electrical properties of the normal breast may be highly variable ( ).
