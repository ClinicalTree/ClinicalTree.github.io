In its 5th edition, _Primer of Diagnostic Imaging_ has undergone a largely cosmetic and functional update. From its inception, the authors strived to make _The Primer_ a “central learning system for residents and fellows” as well as a “refresher text for faculty and practicing physicians.” The changes in the new edition focus on the original goal of the text to be a “handy and readily available” resource for diagnostic radiology residents and practitioners.

Specifically, major changes to formatting and the addition of online access are a few of the changes in this edition. Although the succinct bullet-point text and black and white anatomy drawings are unchanged, this new edition has a completely reformatted color-coded layout that is much improved. These new changes help to increase the text's readability by displaying the information in an easier-to-read two-column format. The book is noticeably more portable as more than 300 pages were eliminated with the new formatting. Although the individual pages feature more text than prior editions, there is still plenty of room for notes and annotations within the margins. Additionally, the figures are now labeled allowing for much improved correlation to the text. Scattered throughout are minor updates to the computed tomography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging sections; however, the majority of the text is unchanged compared to the most recent edition. Also new to this edition, the publisher includes online access to the full text and figures through Elsevier's Expert Consult website.

_The Primer_ is not designed to be read cover to cover. Instead, it functions as a reference text that contains basic foundational knowledge from which the reader can build on. The text retains its 13 organ-system-based imaging chapters including Chest, Cardiac, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary, Musculoskeletal, Neurologic, Head and Neck, Vascular, Breast, Obstetric, Pediatric, and Nuclear Imaging. The chapters typically begin with a brief outline of relevant anatomy followed by the bulk of the chapter addressing the core radiology curriculum. The chapters conclude with dozens of useful pertinent differential diagnoses.

In addition to the imaging chapters, the short chapter on various contrast agents is well done and addresses a common gap in resident knowledge. The final section is a brief, but comprehensive, physics outline. (Note: the additional magnetic resonance imaging physics CD that was included as a bonus with the 4th edition is no longer included.)

Overall, this edition of _Primer of Diagnostic Radiology_ improves on the prior editions by refining the readability, portability and usability of the text while maintaining its beloved high-yield structure. The improved formatting and online access are welcomed features that readers will appreciate. Whether serving as the foundation for radiology board preparation or as a handy reading-room reference, _The Primer_ fills either niche nicely.
