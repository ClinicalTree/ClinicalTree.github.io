## Rationale and Objectives

Iterative reconstruction (IR) computed tomography (CT) techniques allow for radiation dose reduction while maintaining image quality. However, CT coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores may be influenced by certain IR algorithms. The aim of our study is to identify suitable correction factors to ensure consistency between IR and filtered back projection (FBP)-based CAC scoring.

## Material and Methods

A phantom study was performed to derive suitable correction factors for CAC scores and volume (VOL) values with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (or ADMIRE) strength level 3 (ADM3) and 5 (ADM5) vs FBP. CT data from 40 patients were retrospectively analyzed, and CAC score and VOL values were obtained following reconstruction with FBP, ADM3, and ADM5. Linear regression analysis was performed to obtain correction factors. Results with and without application of the correction factors were compared. Inter-reader agreement for risk class stratification was analyzed.

## Results

Phantom experiments determined a correction factor of 1.14 for ADM3 and 1.25 for ADM5. FBP-based CAC scores (897 ± 1413) were significantly higher than uncorrected scores with ADM3 (746 ± 1184, _P_ ≤ .001) and ADM5 (640 ± 1036, _P_ ≤ .001). After application of correction factors, no significant differences were found for CAC scores based on FBP (897 ± 1413) and ADM3 (853 ± 1353, _P_ = .07). The inter-reader agreement for risk stratification was excellent ( _k_ = 0.91).

## Conclusion

ADM3 can be applied to CAC scoring with use of a correction factor. When applying a correction factor of 1.14, excellent agreement with standard FBP for both CAC score and VOL can be achieved.

## Introduction

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a well-established technique for coronary artery disease risk stratification and patient management and is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events . Accordingly, CAC scoring has been integrated into societal guidelines for the assessment of asymptomatic patients with intermediate cardiac risk according to the Framingham classification . However, CAC scoring was recently downgraded to a IIb appropriateness classification because of concerns about exposing a potentially large group of a priori healthy individuals to ionizing radiation through widespread screening . Tube current reduction during CAC scoring has been proposed as a possible solution to lower radiation exposure. However, as reported by Deprez et al. , although lower tube currents do not influence the computed tomography (CT) attenuation of CAC, image noise can be increased, thus limiting interpretation .

Iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have been universally shown to lower image noise and thus allow radiation dose reduction without compromising image quality . They have been widely investigated for use in coronary CT angiography (CCTA) , but their role in CAC scoring remains controversial. Gebhard et al. and Kurata et al. reported a systematic underestimation of the Agatston score with IR . In contrast, Schindler et al. reported excellent agreement between standard filtered back projection (FBP) and IR in terms of Agatston score-based cardiac risk classification .
