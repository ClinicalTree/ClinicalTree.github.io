## Rationale and Objectives

Dose reduction may compromise patients because of a decrease of image quality. Therefore, the amount of dose savings in new dose-reduction techniques needs to be thoroughly assessed. To avoid repeated studies in one patient, chest computed tomography (CT) scans with different dose levels were performed in corpses comparing model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) as a tool to enhance image quality with current standard full-dose imaging.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five human cadavers were scanned (CT HD750) after contrast medium injection at different, decreasing dose levels D0–D5 and respectively reconstructed with MBIR. The data at full-dose level, D0, have been additionally reconstructed with standard adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR), which represented the full-dose baseline reference (FDBR). Two radiologists independently compared image quality (IQ) in 3-mm multiplanar reformations for soft-tissue evaluation of D0–D5 to FDBR (−2, diagnostically inferior; −1, inferior; 0, equal; +1, superior; and +2, diagnostically superior). For statistical analysis, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Wilcoxon test were used.

## Results

Mean CT dose index values (mGy) were as follows: D0/FDBR = 10.1 ± 1.7, D1 = 6.2 ± 2.8, D2 = 5.7 ± 2.7, D3 = 3.5 ± 1.9, D4 = 1.8 ± 1.0, and D5 = 0.9 ± 0.5. Mean IQ ratings were as follows: D0 = +1.8 ± 0.2, D1 = +1.5 ± 0.3, D2 = +1.1 ± 0.3, D3 = +0.7 ± 0.5, D4 = +0.1 ± 0.5, and D5 = −1.2 ± 0.5. All values demonstrated a significant difference to baseline ( _P_ < .05), except mean IQ for D4 ( _P_ = .61). ICC was 0.91.

## Conclusions

Compared to ASIR, MBIR allowed for a significant dose reduction of 82% without impairment of IQ. This resulted in a calculated mean effective dose below 1 mSv.

Computed tomography (CT) is widely available, fast, and offers high-resolution imaging. Consequently, the number of CT examinations is rising , and thus, radiation exposure is increasing as well. As the latter is causing concerns , strategies for effective reduction of radiation dose become necessary .

Various methods are available to reduce dose rate, such as accurate patient positioning, automatic exposure control, and tube-voltage adoption to patient size, as well as iterative image reconstruction methods such as hybrid (adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction \[ASIR\], sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction \[SAFIRE\], and iDose) or fully iterative reconstruction algorithms (model-based iterative reconstruction \[MBIR\] and iterative image reconstruction \[IMR\]) . ASIR, a hybrid iterative reconstruction method, allows for dose reductions of >30% in brain CT, 57% in chest CT, and 38% in abdominal CT compared to filtered back projection (FBP) . For the diagnostic evaluation of high-contrast structures such as lung parenchyma, low dose and even ultra-low dose protocols are well established . In contrast, strategies to reduce dose in contrast-enhanced chest CT are limited by challenges concerning the evaluation of soft tissues. Therefore MBIR, a fully iterative reconstruction method with a dedicated data reconstruction optimized for soft tissues, seems promising for further dose rate reduction while keeping image quality (IQ) stable .
