## Objectives

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are complex, histologically benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that are challenging to measure by simple line measurements. Computer-aided volumetric segmentation of PN has become the recommended method to assess response in clinical trials directed at PN. Different methods for volumetric analysis of PN have been developed. The goal of this study is to test the level of agreement in volume measurements and in interval changes using two separate methods of volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis.

## Methods

Three independent volume measurements were performed on 15 PN imaged at three time-points using 3DQI software at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) and MEDx software at NCI.

## Results

Median volume differences at each time-point comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −0.5, −4.2, and −19.9 mL; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −21.0, −47.0, and −21.0 mL; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −10.0, −70.3, and −29.9 mL. Median differences in percentage change over time comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-3DQI were −1.7, 1.1, and −1.0%; comparing NCI-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −2.3, 3.3, and −1.1%; comparing MGH-3DQI and NCI-MEDx were −0.4, 2.0, and −1.5%. Volume differences were <20% of the mean of the two measurements in 117 of 135 comparisons (86.7%). Difference in interval change was <20% in 120 of the 135 comparisons (88.9%), while disease status classification was concordant in 115 of 135 comparisons (85.2%).

## Conclusions

The volumes, interval changes, and progression status classifications were in good agreement. The comparison of two volumetric analysis methods suggests no systematic differences in tumor assessment. A prospective comparison of the two methods is planned.

## Introduction

Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are histologically benign nerve sheath tumors typically associated with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1). These tumors develop along multiple branches of peripheral nerves and can be large, or irregularly shaped, making standard linear measurements unreliable. PNs are well visualized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence, and can be contoured using computer-aided volumetric lesion segmentation methods . Volumetric evaluation has become the method of choice to determine tumor response and time to disease progression in recent clinical trials for NF1-related PNs .

In the phase 1 trial of the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, 71% of patients with inoperable PN experienced at least 20% volume reduction, and in some cases, improvement in clinical symptoms . If the ongoing phase 2 trial confirms a similar response rate and proves that the moderate size decreases are indeed associated with clinical improvement, selumetinib may become the first medical therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PN.

The customary reporting style at MGH is to give all values with decimals, whereas at NCI volumes over 100 mL are rounded to the nearest whole. The smallest volume in the dataset is 63.0 mL (PN11, MGH-3DQI, time-point 3), and the largest volume is 5150 mL (PN1, NCI-MEDx, time-point 3). Volume trends by age are provided in  Supplementary Fig S1  .

In large tumors, absolute volume differences tend to be greater, but in proportion to their size smaller lesions can have more measurement discrepancy; therefore, we provide both the numeric and relative differences. The volume differences were calculated by subtracting one volume from the matching other, as listed in the header, and ranged from −781.9 mL (PN15, MGH3DQI vs NCI-MEDx, time-point 3) to 406.0 mL (PN1, MGH-3DQI vs NCI-3DQI, time-point 2). Relative volume differences were calculated using the absolute volume differences between the matching pairs (irrespective of negative or positive values), and comparing to the mean of the same pairs. PN ID refers to the lesion identification as listed in  Table 1  .
