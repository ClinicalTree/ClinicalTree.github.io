## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess splenic perfusion in patients with spleen involvement in malignant hematologic diseases and liver cirrhosis and in controls without hepatosplenic disease using volume perfusion computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Between October 2009 and December 2011, 14 hematologic patients with known spleen involvement were recruited. An additional 17 consecutive patients without known splenic or liver disease were enrolled as controls, as well as 29 patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. A 40-second volume perfusion computed tomographic scan of the upper abdomen was performed. Analysis included measurement of splenic volume, blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), K  trans , and mean transit time (MTT).

## Results

In lymphoma patients, mean splenic volume and perfusion parameters were as follows: splenic volume, 1125.34 mL; BF, 61.24 mL/100 mL/min; BV, 16.53 mL/100 mL; K  trans , 37.00 mL/100 mL/min; and MTT, 12.42 seconds. All perfusion values of patients with lymphoma and cirrhosis differed significantly, except for BV, compared to controls. For patients with lymphoma, significant correlations were found between splenic volume and BF ( _r_ = −0.683, _P_ = .000), splenic volume and BV ( _r_ = −0.525, _P_ = .002), and splenic volume and MTT ( _r_ = 0.543, _P_ = .001). During treatment, significant correlations between the diameters of nodular lymphoma target lesions, splenic volume, and the perfusion parameters were present for splenic volume ( _r_ = 0.601, _P_ = .002), BF ( _r_ = −0.777, _P_ = .000) and BV ( _r_ = −0.500, _P_ = .011).

## Conclusions

Volume perfusion computed tomography represents a novel tool for the assessment of splenic perfusion. Preliminary results in patients with spleen involvement reveal lower perfusion values compared to controls or patients with cirrhosis. Therefore, this technique might provide additional information in clinical routine.

As a result of rare primary splenic diseases , the spleen is often considered “silent and forgotten” . On the other hand, secondary manifestations of hematologic, immunologic, oncologic, infectious, vascular, and systemic disorders are frequently found in the spleen . Forty-four percent of patients with lymphoma have splenic involvement . Splenomegaly is a common but unspecific finding, as enlarged spleens do not necessarily indicate lymphoma infiltration , and only 1% to 2% of all patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma present with such splenic enlargement . Spleen involvement is common in mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma , as well as chronic lymphatic leukemia . Accurate staging with assessment of splenic disease is essential for clinical management and follow-up . However, a study by Munker et al revealed a low accuracy of only 15% to 37% for computed tomography (CT) and a disappointing correlation with histologic state. Nevertheless, CT is the most frequently used staging modality. Especially for diffuse involvements, positron emission tomography (PET) using \[  18 F\]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) seems to be superior to CT . Secondary portal hypertension due to either direct lymphoma infiltration of the liver or mediastinal compression of the superior vena cava may additionally alter splenic perfusion. In a similar scenario, portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis can prolong blood transit time because of splenic venous congestion and decreased splenic perfusion . Various imaging techniques such as isotope scintigraphy and \[  15 O\]-labeled water PET have been applied for the assessment of hepatic and splenic perfusion. These techniques are complex and are available only at specialized imaging sites. Functional CT, based on the exchange of iodinated contrast material between the intravascular space and the extravascular interstitial space, is an interesting approach that can be integrated in the clinical routine with manageable effort . This method evolved from single-location dynamic sequences toward multi–detector row computed tomographic perfusion . Recently, Goetti et al applied four-dimensional spiral-mode for computed tomographic liver perfusion with 128-row CT and coverage of up to 14.8 cm.

The aim of our study was to assess and compare the ranges of splenic perfusion using this new method. In the first step, a group of hematologic patients with spleen involvement was analyzed. Elderly patients in particular require special attention, because in this group, liver cirrhosis is frequently (23.7%) undiagnosed . Therefore, we additionally analyzed splenic perfusion in a population with proven liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who had undergone liver perfusion CT prior to transarterial chemoembolization. Finally, a group of patients who had undergone tumor perfusion CT for other purposes but presented with neither splenic diseases nor portal hypertension were included as normal controls.
