CT and MRI of the Whole Body, 5th edition, is an extensive two-volume text covering almost all anatomical sections of radiology, excluding breast imaging. The majority of the material is organized by anatomical system with many high-quality computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The beginning of each chapter covers anatomy and imaging techniques followed by descriptions of specific pathologic conditions. More common pathologies are extensively covered with less common diseases also included. Each chapter also correlates the CT and MRI findings with other imaging modalities including fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine. Overall, the book is well written with logical and succinct explanations of difficult topics.

Important aspects of each chapter are organized for quick reference. For instance, flow charts highlight imaging approaches to lesions in specific organs and many chapters include charts to detail staging systems for specific neoplasms. Summaries of imaging findings for specific pathologies are also included. The breadth of topics covered along with the extensive index and bibliography make this a very useful reference text for residents or practicing radiologists.

There is also a comprehensive chapter covering imaged guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. General indications, contraindications, and considerations are thoroughly covered. Specific procedures are organized by target organ and the text covers device selection, approach, and potential complications for each procedure. In addition to image-guided biopsies and drain placement, issues such as nerve blocks and tumor thermal ablation are covered. An additional chapter on spinal interventions is included. Topics in this chapter include vertebral body biopsies, epidural and facet injections, nerve blocks, and kyphoplasty.

Other chapters are dedicated to issues of contrast nephropathy, brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy, CT urography, CT physics, magnetic resonance imaging physics, and an introductory chapter on clinical positron emission tomography. An entire chapter is also dedicated to the unique problems associated with imaging in patients with liver transplantations.

As with most large, comprehensive texts, each chapter is written by different authors leading to some loss of continuity between the different sections of the book. Some chapters have more extensive descriptions of technical considerations and pertinent anatomy, whereas others are mainly focused on the imaging characteristics of pathological processes.

Topics related to pediatric imaging are briefly included in many chapters with the majority of these topics in the neuroradiology section. A dedicated section to imaging approaches and pathologies encountered in this patient population is desirable and perhaps the authors will consider this for future editions.
