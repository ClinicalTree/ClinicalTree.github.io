## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of the present study was to characterize the kinetics of two nanoparticle-based contrast agents for preclinical imaging, Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000, and the iodinated agent eXIA 160 in both healthy mice and in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Semiautomatic segmentation of liver lesions for estimation of total tumor load of the liver was evaluated in HCC mice.

## Materials and Methods

The normal time course of contrast enhancement was assessed in 15 healthy C57BL/6 mice. Imaging of tumor spread in the liver was evaluated in 15 mice harboring a transgenic HCC model (ASV-B mice). Automatic segmentation of liver lesions for determination of total tumor burden of the liver was tested in three additional ASV-B mice before and after an experimental therapy.

## Results

In healthy mice, clearance of the contrast agent from blood was completed within 3–4 hours for eXIA 160 and Exitron nano 6000, whereas complete blood clearance of Exitron nano 12000 required about 24 hours. eXIA 160 provided maximum liver contrast at 1 hour post injection (p.i.) followed by a continuous decline. Enhancement of liver contrast with Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000 reached a plateau at about 4 hours p.i., which lasted until the end of the measurements at 96 hours p.i. Maximum contrast enhancement of the liver was not statistically different between Exitron nano 6000 and Exitron nano 12000, but was about three times lower for eXIA 160 ( _P_ < .05). Visually Exitron nano 12000 provided the best liver-to-tumor contrast. Semiautomatic liver and tumor segmentation was feasible after the administration of Exitron nano 12000 but did not work properly for the other two contrast agents.

## Conclusions

Both nanoparticle-based contrast agents provided stronger and longer lasting contrast enhancement of healthy liver parenchyma. Exitron nano 12000 allowed automatic segmentation of tumor lesions for estimation of the total tumor load in the liver.

In vivo, noninvasive imaging of rodent models has gained importance in recent years as a tool not only for investigating pathomechanisms of diseases but also for evaluation of new drugs and treatment options . For imaging of structure and morphology, micro–computed tomography (micro-CT) has been widely adopted, not least as part of hybrid imaging systems. Micro-CT especially in combination with positron emission tomography and/or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has become available in many institutions for preclinical research.

Micro-CT is used for evaluation of the anatomy of healthy mice and for characterization of diseases and therapy-induced changes over time in mouse models of inflammatory and metabolic diseases , cardiovascular diseases and, most frequently, in tumors . Micro-CT has been described as “scaled down” CT for small animals , which requires a very high spatial resolution to provide the same diagnostic accuracy for imaging of small animals than conventional CT provides in humans .

Measurements at various time points were performed in five animals for each contrast agent. The data were smoothed for display by two iterations of the moving average of five data points. The lines were obtained by fitting the data exponentially with OriginPro 8 (eXIA 160, dashed line ; Exitron nano 6000, dotted line ; Exitron nano 12000, solid line ). There is a change in the time scale on the x-axis at 5 hours p.i., which results in an apparent change in the slope of the contrast enhancement curves.
