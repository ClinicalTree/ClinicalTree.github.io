## Rationale and Objectives

The study goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery and endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from a previous aneurysm, incorporating the results of the prospective International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms.

## Materials and Methods

Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing surgery or endovascular treatment with no treatment. Twelve clinical scenarios were defined based on aneurysm size and location. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 50- and 40-year-old cohorts. Treatment was considered to be cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

## Results

In 50-year-old patients, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy for aneurysms located in the cavernous carotid artery. For aneurysms less than 7 mm located in the anterior circulation, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy. Endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option for 7- to 24-mm aneurysms, whereas surgery was the most cost-effective option for aneurysms of 25 mm or larger. For aneurysms less than 7 mm and located in the posterior circulation, endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option, whereas surgery was the most cost-effective option for 7- to 12-mm aneurysms. No treatment was the most cost-effective strategy for aneurysms of 13 mm or larger.

## Conclusion

For 50-year-old patients with a history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, treatment of unruptured aneurysms that are located in the cavernous carotid artery, or small (<7 mm) and located in the anterior circulation, or large (≥13 mm) and located in the posterior circulation is ineffective or not cost-effective.

Most cases of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are caused by ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are relatively common, affecting up to 2% to 5% of the population ( ). The management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms depends on the natural history of these lesions and on morbidity and mortality rates associated with their repair. There is still controversy about the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms ( ). In 2003, the International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) investigators reported prospective data on the natural history and treatment outcomes of unruptured intracranial aneurysms ( ). Aneurysm rupture rates varied depending on aneurysm size and location, and treatment outcomes depended on patient age and aneurysm size and location ( ). Patients with a history of SAH from a previous aneurysm had a higher risk of aneurysm rupture than patients without a history of SAH ( ). In addition, patients with a history of aneurysmal SAH have a higher mortality rate than the general population even after successful treatment of ruptured aneurysms ( ). Previous decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were based on earlier estimates of rupture and complication rates and did not consider these factors in their models ( ). Most analyses evaluated the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms only in patients without a history of SAH ( ). The purpose of our study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery and endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with a history of SAH from a previous aneurysm, incorporating the results of the prospective ISUIA ( ).

## Materials and methods

## Study Design

We performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective in which we simulated the clinical paths and health states that patients with a history of SAH from a previous aneurysm would traverse having undergone or not undergone surgery or endovascular treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms ( ). Although standard practice in cost-effectiveness analysis is to compare each treatment to the next best option, we chose to compare both treatments to no treatment as our aim in this study was to decide which unruptured intracranial aneurysms should be treated. We assumed that a previous ruptured aneurysm was completely obliterated after the first SAH and that the patient was well (not disabled). Patients with a history of SAH from a previous aneurysm have a higher risk of aneurysm rupture than patients without a history of SAH ( ). Aneurysm rupture rates vary depending on aneurysm size and location ( ). To account for variable aneurysm characteristics, we modeled 12 different clinical scenarios.
