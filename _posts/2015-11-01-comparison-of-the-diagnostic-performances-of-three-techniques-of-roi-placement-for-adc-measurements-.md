## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively investigate and compare three techniques of region of interest (ROI) placement for apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-one patients with surgical pathology–proven PDAC and 18 healthy volunteers were included. Respiratory-triggered single-shot echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging ( _b_ values = 0, 600 s/mm  2 ) was used to calculate the ADC maps across all participants. Three readers independently measured the ADCs according to three ROI methods: whole-volume, single-slice, and small solid samples of tumor. Mean ADCs for the healthy pancreas were calculated using three measurements from pancreatic head to tail, and ADCs of distal pancreas to the tumor were also measured. The interobserver variability for the three techniques was measured using the interclass correlation coefficient. The diagnostic performances were calculated and compared using the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC).

## Results

All the ADCs measured from the three ROI placements on PDAC were significantly lower than that from the normal pancreas. ADCs of solid tumor samples were significantly lower than that measured from whole volume or single slice (both _P_ < .001). Only the ADCs measured from the solid sample ROI placements on tumor were observed significantly lower than the ADC of distal pancreatic parenchyma ( _P_ = .005). Areas under the ROC for the identification of PDAC, based on small solid samples, single-slice and whole-volume ROIs, respectively, were 0.939, 0.791, and 0.735.

## Conclusions

ADC based on the small solid samples of tumor provided the highest diagnostic performance in assessing PDAC and was more accurate than ADCs measured from single-slice or whole-volume ROI.

Pancreatic cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancer cases . It is one of the few cancers which have shown little improvement in survival rate (<6% of 5-year survival rate) over the past 40 years . About 74% patients with pancreatic cancer died within the first year of diagnosis . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) already plays an important role in detecting and differentiating pancreatic diseases, the recent emergence of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides an additional promising dimension to the conventional anatomic MRI. In particular, several studies have indicated that DWI could be promising in imaging pancreatic diseases. For instance, significantly lower ADC in pancreatic cancer than in benign pancreas tissue has been reported .

In addition to reflecting the physical properties of tissues, ADC values can be influenced by the techniques of region of interest (ROI) placement. For tumors, three techniques including the whole-volume , only a single-slice , and small sample ROIs of tumor have been used for the ADC measurements. However, whether ROIs for ADC measurements should ideally incorporate the entire tumor volume or only a representative tumor section of pancreatic cancer is still unclear. In addition, to our knowledge, no previous study has addressed the impact of the three ROI placement approaches for pancreatic tumor ADC measurements and diagnostic performances of the three ADC measurements.
