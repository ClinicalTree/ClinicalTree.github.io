## Rationale and Objectives

The purposes of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of pulmonary embolism (PE) and renal vein thrombosis in pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome using combined dual-energy (DE) computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and renal CT venography and to evaluate whether DE CTPA can improve the detection of PE in these children.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-two children (aged ≤ 18 years) were included in this study. All children underwent contrast-enhanced DE CTPA and renal CT venography; seven also underwent follow-up DE CTPA and renal CT venography. The presence of PE was determined by (1) CTPA derived from the average weighted 120-kVp images and (2) DE CTPA using dedicated DE software (syngo DE Lung PBV and syngo DE Lung Vessels), which can extract the iodine contents in lung parenchyma and pulmonary arteries. The prevalence and anatomic distribution of PE on CTPA from the average weighted 120-kVp images and DE CTPA and of renal vein thrombosis on CT venography were recorded by two radiologists in consensus; χ  2 tests were used to compare the difference in the detection rate of PE between DE CTPA and conventional CTPA.

## Results

Of 32 children, nine (28.1%) had PE on the basis of the comprehensive DE CT pulmonary angiographic evaluation (CTPA from average weighted 120-kVp images and perfusion images and vascular images generated using the DE CT software). PE was localized in the lobar pulmonary artery in five patients (55.6%), the segmental pulmonary artery in six (66.7%), and the subsegmental pulmonary artery in five (55.6%). PE was distributed in the right upper lobe in two patients (22.2%), the right middle lobe in two (22.2%), the right lower lobe in five (55.6%), and the left lower lobe in six (66.7%). Compared to the CTPA derived from average weighted 120-kVp data, comprehensive DE CTPA showed solitary subsegmental PE in one additional patient (nine vs eight patients), one additional segmental (11 vs 10 segments), and four additional subsegmental pulmonary emboli (two vs six subsegmental pulmonary emboli) ( _P_ \> .05 for all). Eight children (25%) had renal vein thrombosis extending to the inferior vena cava ( _n_ = 5).

## Conclusions

The prevalence of PE was 28.1% and that of renal vein thrombosis 25.0% in the pediatric population with nephrotic syndrome on the basis of our small cohort. DE CTPA has the potential to improve the detection of PE in the pediatric population.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is regarded as relatively rare in the pediatric population . Risk factors for pediatric PE include renal disease, especially nephrotic syndrome, because of altered levels of antithrombin and increases in other coagulation proteins . As in adults, PE is also difficult to diagnose clinically in the pediatric population, because of nonspecific symptoms. Echocardiography can be used to show clots within the heart and central pulmonary arteries and to evaluate pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular function, but it has low specificity and sensitivity for peripheral clots . Magnetic resonance imaging has been used for the diagnosis of PE in pediatric patients, without radiation dose, but magnetic resonance imaging has limited value for peripheral clots, and it is difficult to use magnetic resonance imaging in acutely ill patients. Multiple–detector row computed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA), the reference standard for the diagnosis of PE in adults , was described as the study of choice for evaluating PE in children in one recently published survey .

To the best of our knowledge, the prevalence and anatomic distribution of PE on CTPA have rarely been reported in pediatric patients with nephropathy. Additionally, it was reported in several preliminary studies that the syngo DE Lung PBV and syngo DE Lung Vessels applications (Siemens Medical Solutions, Forchheim, Germany) for dual-energy (DE) computed tomography can be used for the detection of subsegmental pulmonary emboli. Lung PBV was shown to improve the detection of peripheral PE in experimental and clinical studies . Lung Vessels was developed to discriminate nonenhancing subsegmental pulmonary arteries from enhancing ones using DE iodine extraction data . Whether DE CTPA can provide additional diagnostic information for PE in nephrotic children is unclear. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of PE using DE CTPA and to evaluate whether DE CTPA can improve the detection of PE in a cohort of consecutive pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome who were imaged with DE CTPA and renal CT venography.
