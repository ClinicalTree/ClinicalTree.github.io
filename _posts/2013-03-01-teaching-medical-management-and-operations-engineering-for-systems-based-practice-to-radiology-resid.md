## Rationale and Objectives

To better prepare radiology residents for providing care within the context of the larger health care system, this study evaluated the feasibility and impact of a curriculum to enhance radiology residents' understanding and ability to apply concepts from medical management and industrial and operational engineering to systems-based practice problems in radiology practice.

## Materials and Methods

A multiprofessional team including radiology, medical education, and industrial and operational engineering professionals collaborated in developing a seven-module curriculum, including didactic lectures, interactive large-group analysis, and small-group discussions with case-based radiology examples, which illustrated real-life management issues and the roles physicians held. Residents and faculty participated in topic selection. Pre- and post-instruction formative assessments were administered, and results were shared with residents during teaching sessions.

## Results

Attendance and participation in case-based scenario resolutions indicate the feasibility and impact of the interactive curriculum on residents' interest and ability to apply curricular concepts to systems-based practice in radiology. Paired _t_ test analyses ( _P_ < .05) and effect sizes showed residents significantly increased their knowledge and ability to apply concepts to systems-based practice issues in radiology.

## Conclusions

Our iterative curriculum development and implementation process demonstrated need and support for a multiprofessional team approach to teach management and operational engineering concepts. Curriculum topics are congruent with Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements for systems-based practice. The case-based curriculum using a mixed educational format of didactic lectures and small-group discussion and problem analysis could be adopted for other radiology programs, for both residents and continuing medical education applications.

To increase residents' understanding of health care systems so that physicians can initiate and lead improvements in health care delivery, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) introduced a mandate that residency programs provide training and assessment of resident competency in “systems-based practice” (SBP). As Graham et al caution, the ACGME provides a broad definition of SBP—“an awareness of and responsiveness to the larger context and system of health care and the ability to effectively call on system resources to provide care that is of optimal value”—but does not provide operational definitions or scope of practice for specific medical specialties .

Medical educators have stressed the value of formal resident training in SBP, drawing on principles and strategies from health care policy, management, and business to lead health care improvements . However, few residents have formal training in business or management principles before or during residency . Consequently, when faced with complex business and management decisions in health systems, they are unsure how to proceed, frame questions, and seek assistance.
