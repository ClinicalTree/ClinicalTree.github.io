## Rationale and Objectives

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being added to mammography for screening asymptomatic women at increased risk of breast cancer. Because the direction and extent of correlation between mammography and MRI could potentially result in over- or underestimation of the diagnostic gain related to using MRI as an adjunct to mammographic screening, we performed an analysis to evaluate the extent of correlation between mammography and MRI.

## Materials and Methods

We reviewed the published literature to identify multimodality breast cancer screening studies reporting the sensitivity of mammography and MRI, alone and in combination, for breast cancer diagnosis. After calculating the expected sensitivity of combined mammography and MRI under conditions of test independence (no correlation), we compared the calculated and observed sensitivities for combined mammography and MRI. We then calculated correlation coefficients for mammography and MRI.

## Results

Seven studies of multimodality screening in women at increased risk of developing breast cancer were included for analysis. Of these studies, the correlation between film mammography and MRI was positive in three studies, negative in two studies, and not identified in two studies. The calculated correlation coefficients ranged from −0.38 to 0.18. In six of seven studies, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient included 0.0, indicating no significant correlation.

## Conclusions

Evidence from published trials of multimodality breast cancer screening identified no statistically significant correlation between film mammography and MRI. Using both tests for breast cancer screening is likely to improve the early detection of breast cancer in women at increased risk.

Mammography is the current clinical standard for breast cancer screening. The accuracy of mammography in the general population is relatively high, with a meta-analysis of screening mammography reporting sensitivity in the range of 83%–95% and specificity of 94%–99% . However, the sensitivity of mammography in women at increased risk of breast cancer, including BRCA gene mutation carriers, is substantially lower, in the range of 33%–56% . This is thought to be related to multiple factors, such as the younger age at screening for these women, increased breast radiodensity, as well as pathologic and imaging characteristics of breast cancers in this population. Recent studies indicate that breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly sensitive and can detect breast cancers not seen on mammography, particularly in women at increased risk . The American Cancer Society has endorsed the use of breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography for screening these women .

When two diagnostic tests are combined, a positive combined test can be defined in two ways: 1) either test with positive results is considered positive or 2) both tests with positive results are required for the combined test to be considered positive . In the published studies and in current clinical practice, a positive finding on either screening mammography or breast MRI is followed by further diagnostic evaluation. Thus the two-test combination is considered positive if either individual examination is positive.

For the studies included in this analysis, the expected sensitivity of the mammography and MRI combination, assuming statistical independence, was calculated and compared with the observed sensitivity of the two-test combination. Subsequently, using the observed sensitivities of mammography and MRI, alone and in combination, a correlation coefficient (ρ) was calculated to determine the direction and to quantify the magnitude of positive or negative correlation, as described by Shen et al (Sens Test 1 = sensitivity of the first test, Sens Test 2 = sensitivity of the second test, and Sens Observed Combination = observed sensitivity of the two test combination). For tests which are independent, the correlation coefficient is equal to zero.
