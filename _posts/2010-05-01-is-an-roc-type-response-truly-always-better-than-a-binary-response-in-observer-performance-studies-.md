## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess similarities and differences between methods of performance comparisons under binary (yes or no) and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)–type pseudocontinuous (0–100) rating data ascertained during an observer performance study of interpretation of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) versus FFDM plus digital breast tomosynthesis.

## Materials and Methods

Rating data consisted of ROC-type pseudocontinuous and binary ratings generated by eight radiologists evaluating 77 digital mammographic examinations. Overall performance levels were summarized with a conventionally used probability of correct discrimination or, equivalently, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which under a binary scale is related to Youden's index. Magnitudes of differences in the reader-averaged empirical AUCs between FFDM alone and FFDM plus digital breast tomosynthesis were compared in the context of fixed-reader and random-reader variability of the estimates.

## Results

The absolute differences between modes using the empirical AUCs were larger on average for the binary scale (0.12 vs 0.07) and for the majority of individual readers (six of eight). Standardized differences were consistent with this finding (2.32 vs 1.63 on average). Reader-averaged differences in AUCs standardized by fixed-reader and random-reader variances were also smaller under the binary rating paradigm. The discrepancy between AUC differences depended on the location of the reader-specific binary operating points.

## Conclusions

The human observer's operating point should be a primary consideration in designing an observer performance study. Although in general, the ROC-type rating paradigm provides more detailed information on the characteristics of different modes, it does not reflect the actual operating point adopted by human observers. There are application-driven scenarios in which analysis based on binary responses may provide statistical advantages.

Performance assessments and comparisons of technologies and practices in radiology and other imaging-based fields require complicated, time-consuming, expensive studies, particularly when the observer is considered an integral part of the diagnostic system. Retrospective studies are frequently used for this purpose , but in recent years, prospective studies have also been used and have essentially become the gold standard for large, “pivotal” studies .

Regardless of the particular study design, rating data are often collected under a conventional receiver-operating characteristic (ROC)–type paradigm and are used to indicate the level of confidence in a particular noteworthy finding (or a suspected finding) in question. Whether the rating scale being used is discrete (eg, five categories) or pseudocontinuous (eg, 101 categories ranging from 0 to 100), and whether the data are collected for examinations as a whole (ROC) or for findings within examinations (free-response ROC or region-of-interest paradigms), ultimately, a decision threshold (explicit or latent) is used to obtain a “clinically relevant” performance characteristic (eg, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values).
