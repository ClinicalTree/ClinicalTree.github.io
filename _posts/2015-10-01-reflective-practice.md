## Rationale and Objectives

Professionalism can be challenging to teach during residency training. We undertook this study to evaluate the impact of a case-based, reflective practice (RP) curriculum on the attitudes of radiology residents about professionalism.

## Materials and Methods

We developed a case-based radiology-specific RP curriculum focused on topics related to professionalism and ethics. This year-long curriculum was comprised of six individual sessions and was attended by radiology residents. We assessed the program using the Penn State College of Medicine Professionalism Questionnaire, a validated instrument designed to assess attitudes toward professionalism, with anonymous responses collected before and after completion of the 1-year curriculum. We also obtained feedback on individual sessions.

## Results

Our curriculum affected the professional attitudes of residents in 7 of 36 sample items on the professionalism questionnaire ( _P_ <0.05), when analyzed as unpaired data. When stratified into seven specific elements of professionalism, significant differences in resident response were identified in the areas of accountability, honor and integrity, enrichment, and duty. Furthermore, residents generally agreed that the individual sessions were meaningful and were important to their future careers (3.8–4.4 on a five-point scale).

## Conclusions

A case-based, RP curriculum centered about professionalism offers a unique practical approach to expose residents to the concepts of professionalism and ethics in a small group setting. Based on a widely used validated survey instrument, our results indicate that this method raises resident awareness about professionalism and impacts the way in which residents think about this topic and their eventual career.

Over the past two decades, there has been an increased focus on professionalism within the medical community. The Physician Charter , one of the most widely referenced publications about medical professionalism, states that “Professionalism is the basis of medicine's contract with society.” The increased emphasis placed on professional patient-centered care has been noticeable in many fields including radiology. Major organizations such as the American Board of Radiology (ABR), Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA), and American College of Radiology have jointly made strides to educate radiologists about professionalism and ethics . Furthermore, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has mandated the incorporation of professionalism into residency training as one of the six core competencies .

There is no single validated, reliable instrument to measure professionalism . Nevertheless, the ACGME requires that training programs ensure that residents “demonstrate a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities and an adherence to ethical principles” . Because the definition of professionalism continues to evolve, teaching professionalism can be challenging. In addition, professionalism is not a competency that is readily quantifiable and therefore necessitates a more qualitative approach. In an effort to teach and evaluate professionalism, most residency training programs have integrated multiple approaches into the curriculum. These primarily include dedicated lectures, role modeling, and multisource feedback from peers, attending physicians, patients, technologists, nurses, and other support staff . Recently, a group of family physicians developed a comprehensive list of appropriate and inappropriate observable behaviors related to professionalism that would permit specific formative feedback to occur in the clinical environment . They recognize that professionalism is a complex topic best learned in a clinical context, where conflicts with value-based expectations can be recognized, discussed, and resolved. In practice, however, this approach may be challenging to effectively implement in training programs as residents work with a wide array of subspecialists and different services. However, it may be possible to incorporate these expectations and values into small group sessions, where reflection on clinical scenarios permits a valuable discussion about professional behavior.
