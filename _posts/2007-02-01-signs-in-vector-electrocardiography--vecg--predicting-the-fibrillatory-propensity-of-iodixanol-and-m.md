## Rationale and Objectives

To find signs in vector-electrocardiography (VECG) predicting the ventricular fibrillatory propensity (VF-PROP) of iodixanol and mannitol solutions after injection into the left coronary artery (LCA) of pigs.

## Materials and Methods

Five plasma-isotonic solutions perfused LCA: Iod 320 + Na/Ca (iodixanol 320 mg I/mL, 19 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM CaCl  2 ), Iod 320 + Mann (iodixanol 320 mg I/mL, 50 mM mannitol), Mann + Na/Ca (240 mM mannitol, 19 mM NaCl, 0.3 mM CaCl  2 ), Mann (275 mM mannitol), and Ringer (representing “physiologic electrolytes”). The first two solutions have at 37°C viscosity 13 mPas and the others <1 mPas. In eight pigs, 20 mL of each solution was injected twice for 10 seconds, and in 15 pigs, each solution was injected for 11–40 seconds (0.5 mL/second) through a wedged catheter in the LCA. If ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred, injection was stopped and heart was defibrillated. If VF did not occur, perfusion period was 40 seconds. A higher frequency of VF and a shorter period from start of injection until start of VF gave a solution a higher ranking of VF-PROP.

## Results

The 10-second injections caused no VF. Ringer and Iod 320 + Na/Ca caused no VF after 40-second injections, whereas the other solutions caused VF. Ranking the solutions from lowest to highest VF- PROP gave: Ringer = Iod 320 + Na/Ca < Iod 320 + Mann < Mann + Na/Ca < Mann. Prolongation of QRS time and QTc time were the only VECG signs that showed significant differences ( _P_ < .05) between all solutions and correctly ranked the VF-PROP of all solutions in both animal groups.

## Conclusion

The results fit with the concept that a more physiologic electrolyte composition and a higher viscosity of a test solution will, after start of injection of that solution into LCA, delay changes in the electrolyte composition in myocardial interstitial fluid and also delay start of VF. If a plasma isotonic contrast medium (CM) with lower viscosity than that of iodixanol at 320 mgI/mL were created, we conclude that such a CM should have electrolyte composition closer to that of Ringer than present composition (19 mM NaCl and 0.3 mM CaC1  2 ) to counteract the effects of faster diffusion of nonphysiologic electrolyte composition from the low-viscosity CM to myocardial interstitial fluid.

In a previous study in pigs ( ), the original aim was to evaluate the roles of electrolyte content and “chemotoxicity” (see Discussion for aspects on this term) of an iodine contrast medium (CM) iodixanol with regard to its propensity to cause ventricular fibrillation (VF) after prolonged injection into the left coronary artery (LCA). However, it turned out that the viscosity of the CM solutions had an important role in the fibrillatory propensity of the test solutions.

The fibrillatory propensities (VF-PROP) of four test solutions and one control solution (Ringer), all iso-osmolal to plasma, were compared. The solutions (  Table 1 ) were:

> VF starts when perfusion of test solution through the LCA has made the electrolyte composition of the interstitial fluid of the myocardium, supplied by the LCA, sufficiently non-physiologic. The more physiologic the electrolyte composition of the perfusion fluid, and the higher its viscosity, the slower the electrolyte composition of the myocardial interstitial fluid is changed after start of perfusion and VF occurs later (or not at all).
