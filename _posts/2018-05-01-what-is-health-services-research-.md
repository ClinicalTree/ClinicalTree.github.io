## What is Health Services Research?

This special edition of Academic Radiology not using Radiology Alliance for Health Services Research (RAHSR) edition of Academic Radiology reflects both the content of the 2016 Association of University Radiologists meeting that focused on diversity and inclusion as well as health services research (HSR) topics. However, what is HSR and how does it differ from other types of research radiologist perform? The field was recognized in 1966 with the creation of a study section to review federal grants in the field. The Institute of Medicine or National Academy of Medicine has offered definitions in 1979 and 1995 reports with the later report defining HSR as:

> Health services research is a multidisciplinary field of inquiry, both basic and applied, that examines the use, costs, quality, accessibility, delivery, organization, financing, and outcomes of health care services to increase knowledge and understanding of the structure, processes, and effects of health services for individuals and populations

A 2000 ad hoc committee of the Association of Health Services Research defined HSR as:

> _Health services research is the multidisciplinary field of scientific investigation that studies how social factors, financing systems, organizational structures and processes, health technologies, and personal behaviors affect access to health care, the quality and cost of health care, and ultimately our health and well-being. Its research domains are individuals, families, organizations, institutions, communities, and populations_

As the costs continue to climb and the focus shifts to quality and outcomes, the need for standardization, evidence-based medicine and nationally implemented best practices will continue to grow. Health services researchers can develop the research methods and evidence to determine, disseminate and implement best practices.

In 2016 the Association of University Radiologists annual meeting focused on diversity and inclusion. There were multiple RAHSR session presentations that address this topic—some of which were captured as articles in this RAHSR edition.
