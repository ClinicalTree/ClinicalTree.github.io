## Rationale and Objectives

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique which allows determining the bulk magnetic susceptibility distribution of tissue in vivo from gradient echo magnetic resonance (MR) phase images. Our purpose was to evaluate if there is additional diagnostic value of QSM images in detecting the cortical gray matter involvement in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

## Materials and Methods

Our institutional review board approved this study. Conventional MR imaging, including T2-weighted imaging and two- or three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, and QSM imaging examinations were performed in 27 patients (19 male and eight female) with MS. Two radiologists (radiologists 1 and 2) assessed the MS lesions in the following 3 anatomic regions: intracortical, mixed white matter–gray matter (WM–GM), and juxtacortical regions. The numbers of lesions per region category were compared between conventional MR images with and without QSM images.

## Results

For radiologists 1 and 2, QSM images identified 6 (50.0%) and 7 (50.0%) additional lesions that were not seen in the conventional MR images, respectively. In a lesion-by-lesion analysis, the substantial fraction (20 \[25.3%\] of 79 at radiologist 1, 22 \[29.7%\] of 74 at radiologist 2) of juxtacortical white matter lesions on the conventional MR images were scored as mixed WM–GM lesions with QSM images.

## Conclusions

Our preliminary results suggest that the MR imaging with QSM may increase the sensitivity in cortical lesion detection in the MS brain and improved distinction between juxtacortical and mixed WM–GM lesions.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that usually affects young adults and leads to chronic invalidism. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has high sensitivity, revealing macroscopic tissue abnormalities in MS patients. Conventional MR sequences, such as T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T1WI, both with and without administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent, provide important pieces of information for diagnosing MS, understanding its natural history, and assessing treatment efficacy.

The results of histopathologic studies have shown that a substantial portion of the total cerebral lesion load in MS is located within the gray matter or at the border between the cortex and subcortical white matter . This acknowledgment of gray matter involvement in the disease has led to the incorporation of juxtacortical lesions in recently defined MS diagnostic criteria and interest in the role of diffuse damage in the normal-appearing gray matter in determining disability and cognition . In previous study, the MS lesions involving the U-fibers were classified into four patterns as 1) a lesion involving only the U-fibers, 2) a lesion involving the cortex and U-fibers, 3) a lesion involving the U-fibers and deep white matter, and 4) a lesion involving the cortex, U-fibers, and deep white matter . The acknowledgment of these particular anatomic distributions of plaque burden would be expected to allow for more precise correlation with neurologic impairment; however, on conventional MRI, it has not been well recognized that MS lesions may involve only the U-fibers and may extend to the cortex. Moreover, the cortical lesions are largely missed on conventional MRI.
