Abdominal imaging encompasses a wide gamut of diseases in a variety of organs serving often unrelated functions. A book designed to review common conditions as a quick review is a welcome addition. This book presents these common diseases in a case based format while also summarizing complications and management.

This book is coauthored by two abdominal imagers, Dr Harisinghani, associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of abdominal MRI at Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dr Mueller, professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of abdominal imaging and interventional radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital.

This case-based book reviews hepatic, biliary, pancreatic, splenic, genitourinary, adrenal, gastrointestinal, and retroperitoneal disorders. Organization of each case consists of clinical history, images, and radiologic findings. Often there are annotations identifying the findings on the images. Subsequently, each case includes the differential diagnosis, clinical relevance, complications, etiology, further imaging findings, including multimodality, and treatment. Such an approach is pertinent to everyday clinical practice as well as oral board examinations. References are supplied after each case. The last section summarizes computed tomography (CT) protocols.

The book is well organized and succinctly written. The image quality is good. Many cases include both CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examples for the same case. However, MRI is sometimes underused, such as in genitourinary and pancreatic imaging. In addition, there is no inclusion of MRI in the acute abdomen. An appendix of MRI protocols would have been a nice complement to the included CT protocols.

By providing common disorders in an organized fashion, the experienced and accomplished authors are successful in reviewing abdominal disorders. This book will well serve residents, oral board examinees, and general radiologists. However, a case based review of abdominal MRI would complement this book.
