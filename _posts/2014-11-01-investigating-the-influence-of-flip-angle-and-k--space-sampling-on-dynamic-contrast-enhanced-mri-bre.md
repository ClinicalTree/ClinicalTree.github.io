## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively investigate the effect of flip angle (FA) and _k_ -space sampling on the performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE-) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) breast sequences.

## Materials and Methods

Five DCE-MRI breast sequences were evaluated (10°, 14°, and 18° FAs; radial or linear _k_ -space sampling), with 7–10 patients in each group ( _n_ = 45). All sequences were compliant with current technical breast screening guidelines. Contrast agent (CA) uptake curves were constructed from the right mammary artery for each examination. Maximum relative enhancement, _E_ max , and time-to-peak enhancement, _T_ max , were measured and compared between protocols (analysis of variance and Mann–Whitney). For each sequence, calculated values of maximum relative enhancement, _E_ calc , were derived from the Bloch equations and compared to _E_ max . Fat suppression performance (residual bright fat and chemical shift artifact) was rated for each examination and compared between sequences (Fisher exact tests).

## Results

Significant differences were identified between DCE-MRI sequences. _E_ max increased significantly at higher FAs and with linear _k_ -space sampling ( _P_ < .0001; _P_ = .001). Radial protocols exhibited greater _T_ max than linear protocols at FAs of both 14° ( _P_ = .025) and 18° ( _P_ < .0001), suggesting artificially flattened uptake curves. Good correlation was observed between _E_ calc and _E_ max ( _r_ = 0.86). Fat suppression failure was more pronounced at an FA of 18° ( _P_ = .008).

## Conclusions

This retrospective approach is validated as a tool to compare and optimize breast DCE-MRI sequences. Alterations in FA and _k_ -space sampling result in significant differences in CA uptake curve shape which could potentially affect diagnostic interpretation. These results emphasize the need for careful parameter selection and greater standardization of breast DCE-MRI sequences.

In the evaluation of breast tumors, the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon classifies both lesion morphology and the pattern of contrast agent (CA) uptake with time . Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to increase the specificity of breast MRI examinations, through evaluation of the kinetic behavior of CA uptake . Enhancement curves may demonstrate persistent, plateau, or wash-out behaviors of signal intensity across the dynamic series, where a wash-out of signal intensity is often indicative of malignancy . With smaller lesions in which morphology is indeterminate, this evaluation of CA kinetics becomes increasingly important in diagnosis.

Reliable classification of CA uptake curves requires rapid T  1 -weighted pulse sequences to be designed to provide image intensity directly proportional to CA concentration over the range of expected T  1 values. Effective fat suppression is also required to facilitate the assessment of small lesions. Accurate evaluation and standardization of sequence performance is particularly important because differences across magnetic resonance (MR) systems and sequences can significantly affect sensitivity for detecting lesions . However, the accuracy of sequence assessment with test objects is limited: spatial variations in the B  1 field can hinder verification of image intensity dependence on T  1 and the flip angle (FA) applied to a test object may not accurately represent clinical examinations. In addition, variability in patient size and shape and differences in patient circulation affect T  1 values after intravenous CA administration. An assessment of the impact of sequence parameter changes on the diagnostic capability of an examination would therefore be invaluable. As the internal mammary artery provides a source of arterial enhancement in the examination field of view, we used it to construct signal intensity versus time curves retrospectively and compared these curves between patients examined with breast DCE-MRI sequences of varying FAs and _k_ -space sampling patterns. We simultaneously assessed the effect of these parameters on fat suppression performance. Every sequence evaluated was used in clinical practice and was therefore compliant with current technical breast screening guidelines . Sequences with different _k_ -space sampling coverage pattern and FA were modeled to validate experimental results.
