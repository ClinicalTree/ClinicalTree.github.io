## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the benefits of dual-energy computed tomography (CT) colonography (DECTC) as a preoperative staging tool in patients with clinically suspected colorectal cancer (CRC).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-two patients with colorectal neoplasia underwent preoperative abdominal DECTC on a dual-source scanner (SOMATOM Definition Flash; Siemens) operated at tube potentials of Sn140/100 kVp. Scans were evaluated for local tumor stage and the presence of synchronous intracolonic and extracolonic findings using dual-energy color-coded images. An enhancement ≥25 Hounsfield units (HU) was defined to indicate malignancy. Patients' effective doses were calculated.

## Results

Preoperative DECTC allowed for complete bowel evaluation in all patients, including subjects with stenosing CRC. DECTC revealed 22 carcinomas (mean enhancement, 47 ± 12 HU). In total, 22 synchronous intracolonic lesions were detected, including 19 adenomas (mean enhancement, 51 ± 19 HU). Benign structures showed enhancement <25 HU. Comparing DECTC to histopathology, 95% carcinomas and 71% synchronous lesions proximal to stenosing CRC could be verified. Mean estimated effective dose was 13.0 ± 5.2 mSv.

## Conclusions

Preoperative DECTC can be used as an accurate and dose-efficient primary-staging examination. Especially after incomplete optical colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy enables full preoperative colonic assessment on the same day. Dual-energy CT enables distinction between neoplasia and non-neoplastic findings within and outside the colon. Therefore, DECTC can be regarded as a promising “one-stop” staging examination in patients with clinically suspected CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks second in women and third in men on the list of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in the economically developed world and develops from benign precursor lesions with malignant potential (colorectal adenomas) following the adenoma–carcinoma sequence . For detection of these lesions, optical colonoscopy (OC) is considered standard of care. Noninvasive alternatives are computed tomographic colonography (CTC, also known as virtual colonoscopy) and magnetic resonance (MR) colonography . Exact cancer staging is mandatory to determine the patient's individual prognosis and treatment strategy.

Recently, numerous clinical applications for dual-energy (DE) CT have emerged, predominantly developed on dual-source CT scanners operating two x-ray tubes at different tube potentials. The two data sets acquired show differences in photon attenuation. Based on three material decomposition algorithms, virtual nonenhanced (VNE) images and color-coded iodine maps can be generated (  Fig 1 ) .

Virtual nonenhanced image ( _upper left_ ) and iodine-only image ( _upper right_ ) can be fused to a color-coded DE image ( _lower right_ ). Images show a stenosing CRC ( _arrow_ ) and a synchronous adenoma ( _arrowhead_ ). _Asterisk_ denotes normal enhancement of left kidney. Polypoid lesion detected proximal to colonic stenosis on three-dimensional endoluminal images ( _lower left_ ) can be verified on two-dimensional color-coded DE images ( _lower right_ ), in which colonic neoplasia shows significant iodine uptake.
