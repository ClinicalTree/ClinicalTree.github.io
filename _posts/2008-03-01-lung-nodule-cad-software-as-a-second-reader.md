## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this multicenter, multireader study was to evaluate the performance of computed tomography (CT) lung nodule computer-aided detection (CAD) software as a second reader.

## Methods and Materials

The study involved 109 patients from four sites. The data were collected from a variety of multidetector CT scanners and had different scan parameters. Each chest CT scan was divided into four quadrants. A group of three expert thoracic radiologists identified nodules between 4 and 30 mm in maximum diameter within each quadrant. The standard of reference was established by a consensus read of these experienced radiologists. The cases were then interpreted by 10 other radiologist readers with varying degrees of experience, without and then with CAD software. These readers identified nodules and assigned an actionability rating to each quadrant before and after using CAD software. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to measure the performance of the readers without and with CAD software.

## Results

The average increase in area under the curve for the 10 readers with CAD software was 1.9% for a 95% confidence interval (0.8–8.0%). The area under the curve without CAD software was 86.7% and with CAD software was 88.7%. A nonsignificant correlation was observed between the improvement in sensitivity and experience of the radiologists. The readers also showed a greater improvement in patients with cancer as compared to those without cancer.

## Conclusions

In this multicenter trial, CAD software was shown to be effective as a second reader by improving the sensitivity of the radiologists in detecting pulmonary nodules.

Detection and characterization of primary and metastatic lung cancer depends on successful identification of lung nodules on chest computed tomography (CT) scans ( ). Identification of indeterminate pulmonary nodules on chest multidetector CT (MDCT) scans is a common occurrence in routine radiology practice. It is clinically important to identify small nodules on a chest CT scan. A study by Wisnivesky et al showed that the smaller the size of the nodule more likely is the presence of Stage 1 lung cancer ( ). The location of the detected nodules is recorded for purposes of follow-up. In addition, change in size is valuable in characterization of a nodule. Malignant nodules usually have a faster doubling time compared with benign nodules. If a nodule remains unchanged for more than 2 years, it is conventionally designated as benign ( ).

Several studies have reported that radiologists often overlook nodules while interpreting chest CT scans ( ). This may be due to observational oversight or because of the large amount of data and increasing caseload produced by MDCT scanners. The newest generations of CT scanners allow isotropic scanning of the chest with high spatial resolution enabling identification of small pulmonary nodules. In this context, computer-aided detection (CAD) has been proposed by several researchers ( ) to facilitate accurate and efficient detection of lung nodules.
