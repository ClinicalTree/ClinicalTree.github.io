## Rationale and Objectives

Despite ongoing technical refinements, coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) remains challenging in its diagnostic value by electrocardiographic (ECG) misregistration and motion artifacts, which commonly occur in patients with atrial fibrillation and high or irregular heart rates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the radiation dose and the number of inconclusive coronary segments at cCTA using retrospective ECG gating at 100 and 70 kV.

## Materials and Methods

With institutional review board approval, 154 patients (median age 54 years, 98 men) with high or irregular heart rate prospectively underwent retrospectively ECG-gated cCTA without tube current modulation on a third-generation dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) system at 70 kV ( _n_ = 103) or on a second-generation DSCT system at 100 kV ( _n_ = 51). Images were reconstructed in best diastolic phase (BDP), best systolic phase (BSP), and in all phases (APs) at 10% intervals across the R-R cycle. Objective and subjective image qualities were evaluated as well as the presence of motion artifacts with the three different reconstruction approaches.

## Results

The mean heart rate was 93 ± 16 bpm. The mean effective radiation dose was 4.5 mSv for 70 kV compared to 8.4 mSv for 100 kV ( _P_ < 0.05). At BDP reconstruction, 71% ( _n_ = 110) of the patients showed motion artifacts in one or more coronary segments. At BSP reconstruction, the number of patients with motion artifacts decreased to 37% ( _n_ = 57). In contrast, if images were reconstructed with the AP approach, all vessels and coronary segments were evaluable with both cCTA protocols.

## Conclusions

Retrospectively ECG-gated cCTA at 70 kV results in 52% decreased radiation dose. Further using the AP algorithm allowed for diagnostic evaluation of all coronary segments for stenosis, in contrast to BDP or BSP phase alone.

## Introduction

Despite ongoing technical refinements, coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) remains limited in its diagnostic value by electrocardiographic (ECG) misregistration and motion artifacts, which most commonly occur in patients with atrial fibrillation and high and irregular heart rates. Accordingly, a substantial share of currently available studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy of this test exclude nonevaluable coronary segments from their data analysis . Thus, in _real life_ , diagnostic accuracy of cCTA may be significantly lower compared to the results of clinical trials. From a statistical viewpoint, when gauging cCTA's true diagnostic performance, it may be more appropriate to apply 3 × 2 tables that include nonevaluable coronary segments as a separate cell compared to including them in the “false negative” or the “false positive” cell of a 2 × 2 table, as is common in clinical trials .

Generally, greater robustness of this test is desirable, especially when atherosclerosis is present, to minimize downstream investigations due to inconclusive cCTA studies. Retrospectively ECG-gated cCTA without ECG-controlled tube current modulation is the most robust cCTA imaging technique . This technique allows reconstruction of images at any desired phase of the heart cycle and the removal of image data acquired during irregular heartbeats, which can lead to ECG misregistration and motion artifacts. Moreover, this technique allows accurate assessment of cardiac function facilitating prediction of mortality as recently shown by an analysis from the multinational CONFIRM registry .
