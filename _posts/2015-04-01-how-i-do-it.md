## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to demonstrate that an intra-arterial liver therapy clinical research database system is a more workflow efficient and robust tool for clinical research than a spreadsheet storage system. The database system could be used to generate clinical research study populations easily with custom search and retrieval criteria.

## Materials and Methods

A questionnaire was designed and distributed to 21 board-certified radiologists to assess current data storage problems and clinician reception to a database management system. Based on the questionnaire findings, a customized database and user interface system were created to perform automatic calculations of clinical scores including staging systems such as the Child-Pugh and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer, and facilitates data input and output.

## Results

Questionnaire participants were favorable to a database system. The interface retrieved study-relevant data accurately and effectively. The database effectively produced easy-to-read study-specific patient populations with custom-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria.

## Conclusions

The database management system is workflow efficient and robust in retrieving, storing, and analyzing data.

With the growing amount of clinical research studies in the field of interventional oncology, selective patient data are becoming more difficult to store and organize effectively. Existing hospital electronic medical record (EMR) systems store patient data in the form of reports and data tables. Our institution's EMR system placed our researchers in a position where time-consuming methods are needed to search for suitable patients for clinical studies. Researchers had to manually read through the reports and data tables to filter patients and gather data. For most studies, spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Washington) are often used as a data repository similar to a database to record and organize patient data for research. Once the spreadsheet is populated, it is manually filtered by set study parameters and then pushed to statistical analysis software for further analysis. For statistical analysis, columns containing text are translated into binary values (1 or 0) to be in a format acceptable by statistical analysis software. For example, each tumor entity is assigned a new column. Patient histologic reports are read manually to assign a value of 1 or 0 to each tumor entity column, 1 for positive, and 0 for negative. Under a tumor entity column, researchers would write a value of 1 for all patients with the tumor and a 0 for all patients without the tumor.

This method of data storage has limitations in the organization and the quality of the data. Data input and analysis without a database run a higher risk of incorrect data entry, patient exclusion, and a higher risk of introducing duplicates. Furthermore, data selection and calculation are time consuming. An alternative could be the clinical research database that Meineke et al. proposed . However, it is too unspecific for interventional oncology research and would need additional optimization, for example, the capability to automatically calculate various variables such as tumor staging systems and to record information about multiple treatment sessions.

## Database and Query Interface Design

![Figure 1, The dataflow chart. This chart shows a general layout of the database server and its clients. It illustrates how the database management system performs queries ( orange circle ) such as statistical analysis. Multiple computers are granted access to the database. The blue rectangles represent the database management system software. Researchers can use the database client graphical user interface (GUI) to import data without needing to format. Researchers also control data through the GUI. Queries are usually run through the GUI to provide wanted results. Once the results are obtained, researchers export the query to a spreadsheet, illustrated by the green rectangle .

## Graphical User Interface Design and Utility

![Figure 3, This form illustrates how users input data into the database. The form is divided into three parts: (a) Patient form—data consists of basic patient information. Patient identification (PID) is a unique number generated by the database to uniquely identify patients. LAST MODIFIED is a timestamp of when the data were most recently updated or added. MODIFIED BY is a text box that records who updated/added data. (a1) shows the total patient number contained in the database. (b) Tumor—data consist of a patient's primary and secondary tumors in the liver. The dropdown allows users to select a tumor or add new tumor types (eg, metastatic disease). (b1) shows how many tumor types the patient has in the liver. (c) Embolization procedures—data consist of sessions of intra-arterial therapies (IATs). (c1) shows how many sessions of IATs a patient has went through. DEB, drug-eluting beads; DOB, date of birth; EMBO, embolization; HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; MRN, medical record number; TACE, transarterial chemoembolization.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/HowIDoIt/2_1s20S1076633214004607.jpg)
