## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare average glandular dose (AGD) in two full-field digital mammography units using different anode/filter combinations.

## Materials and Methods

Mammographies of 50 consecutive patients on a mammography system using a tungsten/rhodium (W/Rh) anode/filter combination were retrospectively compared to prior examinations on a different mammography unit using combinations of Molybdenum (Mo) and Rhodium (Rh). To exclude effects of increasing patient age, two prior examinations within 5 years were used. Both views of one breast were chosen for analysis. AGD was recorded as stated by each mammography unit. Accuracy of stated AGD and contrast-detail resolution were assessed using different breast phantoms.

## Results

The mean AGDs from the examinations using W/Rh were 0.95 mGy and 1.01 mGy for craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views compared to 1.51 mGy and 1.54 mGy, respectively, using combinations of Mo and Rh ( _P_ < .001). Relative reduction of AGD was independent of breast thickness but decreased with increasing breast density (partial correlation coefficient of 0.46, _P_ < .005 and 0.57, _P_ < .001, for CC and MLO views, respectively). Low-level contrast resolution was equal in both units using standard acquisition parameters.

## Conclusion

In clinical mammographies, higher energy beam spectra obtained using W/Rh anode/filter combinations may significantly contribute to lowering AGD compared to Mo/Mo, Mo/Rh, and Rh/Rh in breasts that are not extremely dense.

The use of digital mammography has led to significant reductions in the average glandular dose (AGD) associated with mammography examinations . Among the advantages of digital mammography are an increased dynamic range and the ability to optimize image contrast by postprocessing techniques . In film mammography, the detector dose is determined by properties of the film and relative contrast can be optimized by using a molybdenum anode with characteristic peaks at 17.5 and 19.6 keV . However, with the high dynamic range of digital detectors, image quality has to be characterized by signal-difference-to-noise-ratio (SDNR), which for calcifications and tumors is optimal for photon spectra of higher mean energy . The latter may be particularly true in thicker breasts . It has been reported that higher energy photons may be absorbed more effectively by selenium layers used in some flat panel detectors . Several phantom studies have demonstrated a decrease in AGD for a given SDNR with the use of a tungsten/rhodium (W/Rh) anode filter combination compared with molybdenum/molybdenum (Mo/Mo) or molybdenum/rhodium (Mo/Rh) . One recent study compared two groups of patients examined with either Mo/Mo or Mo/Rh according to breast thickness or with W/Rh . However, no direct, intraindividual comparison of the AGD of different mammography systems in clinical use has so far been published.

Currently available digital mammography systems differ in terms of both the x-ray beam spectra and detector technologies used. Charge-coupled device–based systems are in use in stereotactic breast imaging, but are no longer being used in full-field digital mammography. One system uses a photon counting slot-scan technique . However, the majority of digital mammography systems available employ flat panel detectors on the basis of amorphous silicon or selenium. Several studies have examined the image quality of different detector technologies .

where _C  i_ represents the object position in the contrast column (thickness), _D  i_ ,  th denotes the smallest visible diameter in this column, and _n_ represents the number of rows/columns in the phantom. A higher IQFinv corresponds to a better contrast-detail resolution. Four Plexiglas plates of 1 cm thickness each were placed on the phantom to simulate a typical breast. At a tube voltage of 28kVp, eight consecutive images were acquired at tube currents of 63 mAs, 80 mAs, and 100 mAs. In addition to using predefined imaging settings, a further set of phantom images using automated settings were acquired on each system. Automated analysis of phantom images was performed using a software program (CDMAM Analyser Version 1.1, Artinis Medical Systems BV, AS Zetten, Netherlands) and the IQFinv at each setting was determined.
