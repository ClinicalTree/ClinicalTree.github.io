## Rationale and Objectives

It is well known that synchronous cancers (incidence, 2%–11%) and polyps (incidence, 12%–58%) occur in patients with colorectal cancer. Magnetic resonance colonography (MRC) seems like the obvious choice as a diagnostic tool in preoperative evaluation, because it is noninvasive, and most of the colon can be evaluated. Furthermore, it has higher patient acceptance, and no sedation or radiation is used. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing MRC preoperatively in an everyday clinical situation in a group of patients who were not offered a full conventional colonoscopy or in whom full conventional colonoscopy was not possible.

## Materials and Methods

In a 13-month period, 47 patients diagnosed with rectal or sigmoid colon cancer scheduled for operation were included in the study. MRC was performed with bowel purgation either the night before surgery or as ambulatory MRC the week before surgery.

## Results

Full MRC was performed in 98% of the patients. In four patients, 12 synchronous lesions (one cancer, two plaques of carcinosis, and nine adenomas) were found. One flat adenoma and five small polyps were missed by MRC and perioperative palpation but found on postoperative colonoscopy. The findings resulted in altered operative strategies in three patients.

## Conclusion

This study shows the feasibility and potential gain of preoperative MRC in patients with sigmoid colon cancer or rectal cancer.

Synchronous cancers and polyps in the colon are well-known occurrences in patients with colorectal cancer. Synchronous lesions have been described numerous times in the literature, with varying incidences of 2% to 11% for cancers and 12% to 58% for polyps . Thus, the widespread recommendation for full colonic evaluation preoperatively with conventional colonoscopy (CC) seems only sensible and is aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality.

Magnetic resonance (MR) colonography (MRC) was first described in 1997 by Luboldt et al , and with its noninvasive nature and per patient high sensitivity for MRC with bowel purgation close to 100% for lesions >10 mm , many have begun regarding MRC as the diagnostic tool of the future. Thus, MRC seems like the obvious choice as a diagnostic tool in preoperative evaluation. It is noninvasive (fewer complications), and because of the method of using water or air for colon distention, most of the colon can be evaluated (fewer incomplete evaluations) . Furthermore, MRC has higher patient acceptance (compliance), and no sedation or radiation is used . So far, only one smaller experimental study has been conducted concerning the preoperative evaluation of patients with colorectal cancer using MRC , but several studies using computed tomographic colonography have been published . Although not directly comparable, all of the studies have concluded that MRC or computed tomographic colonography is feasible and useful in evaluating the entire colon preoperatively, especially in patients with occlusive carcinomas.
