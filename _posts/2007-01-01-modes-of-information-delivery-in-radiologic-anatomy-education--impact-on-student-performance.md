## Rationale and Objectives

This study provides a systematic assessment of different methods of delivering radiologic teaching content (lecture, printed text, and digital content delivery) under standard conditions, enabling comparison of the effectiveness of these methods.

## Materials and Methods

A printed atlas of sectional anatomy was used as a standard. Digital content was developed on the basis of the printed atlas. Lecturers used both the printed and the digital content to prepare lectures. Standardized teaching material thus created was presented to second-term undergraduate students who had attended the school’s anatomy course, but had not received any radiology teaching. Multiple choice examinations were used to assess the students’ ability to recognize anatomical structures in known as well as unknown images. In a survey, the students’ subjective experience of the learning process was assessed.

## Results

No difference was seen between the groups regarding examination results. Students preferred a combination of digital media and lectures by enthusiastic teachers.

## Conclusions

The shortage of teachers requires a compromise concerning the delivery of radiologic anatomy content in a medical school setting. Based on our results, we recommend a combined approach of lecture and digital content delivery.

The use of digital media is continually extending its foothold within undergraduate, postgraduate, and continued medical education. Instructional methods that use digital methods of information delivery have been evaluated with promising results ( ). They appear to be particularly successful when the teaching content and exemplars are predominantly visual ( ). A case in point is undergraduate training in diagnostic radiology, in which image understanding and pattern recognition need to be practiced, and an essential part of teaching consists in pointing out features of an image by annotation.

That resources for teaching tend to be tightly constrained necessitates optimal use of such resources as measured by learners’ knowledge retention and development of pattern recognition skills. At the same time, the subjective learning experience should be positive and motivating. We therefore chose instructional methods based on different modes of information delivery and compared these by taking various measures that reflect the outcomes.
