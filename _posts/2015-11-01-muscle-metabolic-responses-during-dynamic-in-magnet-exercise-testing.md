## Rationale and Objectives

The clinical utility of supine in-magnet bicycling in combination with phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  31 P MRS) to evaluate quadriceps muscle metabolism was examined in four children with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) in remission and healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

## Materials and Methods

Two identical maximal supine bicycling tests were performed using a magnetic resonance–compatible ergometer. During the first test, cardiopulmonary performance was established in the exercise laboratory. During the second test, quadriceps energy balance and acid/base balance during incremental exercise and phosphocreatine recovery were determined using  31 P MRS.

## Results

During the first test, no significant differences were found between patients with JDM and their healthy peers regarding cardiopulmonary performance. The outcomes of the first test indicate that both groups attained maximal performance. During the second test, quadriceps phosphocreatine and pH time courses were similar in all but one patient experiencing idiopathic postexercise pain. This patient demonstrated faster phosphocreatine depletion and acidification during exercise, yet postexercise mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate synthesis rate measured by phosphocreatine recovery kinetics was approximately twofold faster than control (time constant 23 seconds vs 43 ± 7 seconds, respectively).

## Conclusions

These results highlight the utility of in-magnet cycle ergometry in combination with  31 P MRS to assess and monitor muscle energetic patterns in pediatric patients with inflammatory myopathies.

Exercise is increasingly used as a nonpharmacological intervention in the clinical management of patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. Evaluation of the impact of exercise on systemic health commonly involves periodic testing with concomitant measurement of direct and indirect physiological outcome parameters (eg, maximal oxygen uptake) . These, however, are all macroscopic outcome measures that greatly rely on voluntary effort. Availability of more objective outcome measures that provide functional information at the cellular, or even molecular, level would significantly strengthen ongoing efforts to tailor exercise interventions to individual patient needs and limitations. Although muscle biopsies before and after exercise may provide relevant microscopic information , the procedure is highly invasive and therefore undesirable, particularly in pediatric care. Therefore, we explored the potential of an in vivo magnetic resonance (MR)–based methodology to serve as a sensitive and noninvasive tool that guides the development of personalized exercise interventions.

In vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  31 P MRS) has long offered a noninvasive window into the metabolic capacity of skeletal muscle to support exercise . Recordings of  31 P MR spectra from human muscle during exercise and metabolic recovery have been commonly used to evaluate cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthetic function on the basis of dynamic changes in phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH . In a more general sense, these recordings yield information on the in vivo homeostatic capacity of the metabolic networks in muscle with respect to myocellular energy balance (MEB) and myocellular proton balance (MPB) during exercise.
