## Rationale and Objectives

The main aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical validity and correlation with pathologic invasiveness in the pulmonary adenocarcinoma spectrum based on the novel qualitative computed tomography criterion for subsolid nodule (SSN) classification, which classified SSN into pure ground-glass nodule, heterogeneous ground-glass nodule, and part-solid nodule. In addition, we compared the performance of the conventional and novel classifications.

## Materials and Methods

The computed tomography images of 41 SSN nodules were interpreted by six observers independently, and the SSN characteristics were classified according to both the conventional and the novel classification systems. Each observer assessed 41 nodules in two different classifications separated by a minimum of 8 weeks. The kappa ( _κ_ ) coefficient test was used to determine the reliability. The correlation between pulmonary adenocarcinoma spectrum and the SSN classification was analyzed with Spearman correlation coefficients.

## Results

Interobserver agreement ( _κ_ ) was 0.702 (range 0.42–0.89) and 0.707 (range 0.58–0.88) for the conventional and the novel classifications for SSN, respectively, and intraobserver agreement ( _κ_ ) was 0.92 and 0.88 for the conventional and the novel classifications for SSN, respectively. The novel SSN classification (correlation coefficient range 0.622–0.732) is more strongly correlated with the pathologic invasiveness degree of lesions in adenocarcinoma spectrum than the conventional SSN classification (correlation coefficient range 0.458–0.644).

## Conclusions

The agreement between observers on the novel SSN classification system was good and had better correlation with pathologic invasiveness than the conventional SSN classification. Further studies are needed to confirm these results on interobserver agreement.

## Introduction

Pulmonary subsolid nodules (SSNs) have emerged as important aspects of the lung adenocarcinoma spectrum following the introduction of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening over the past few years . SSNs may be further classified as either pure ground-glass nodules (GGNs) or part-solid nodules (PSNs) according to the convention classification proposed by the Fleischner Society . An accurate and objective assessment of the SSN classification system is necessary before it can be reliably used in a clinical setting. The inconsistency in differentiating between GGN and PSN may affect surveillance recommendations and prognostic determination, which would lead to different management strategies and follow-up periods . Previous studies have reported a low to moderate interobserver agreement for classifying solid nodules, PSNs, and GGNs on LDCT scans . Ridge et al has found that a moderate interobsever agreement for differentiating subsolid from solid nodules . However, limited studies have investigated interobsever agreement for differentiating GGNs from PSNs .

In the present study, a novel classification algorithm based on qualitative computed tomography (CT) criterion proposed by Kakinuma et al divided SSNs into pure GGN, heterogeneous GGNs (partly consolidated on lung windows), and PSNs (with a mediastinal window solid component) . Previous studies have investigated the clinical prognostic importance and natural course of SSNs based on the novel classification . However, this classification has not yet been well validated for interobserver and intraobserver agreement.

A solid component in the mediastinal window was not observed. (c and d) “Heterogeneous ground-glass nodules” represent lesions having a solid component ( white arrow ) in only the lung window but not in the mediastinal window.

![Figure 2, Flowchart of the study design. The review process consists of one interactive education training session and two review rounds. The image analysis was performed sequentially in two rounds by the six observers on two separate occasions 8 weeks apart. The first-round analysis of images was designed to assess the interobserver variability among the six observers and intraobsever variability among two observers by conventional subsolid nodule classification, whereas the second-round analysis aimed to evaluate the interobserver variability among the six observers and intraobsever variability among two observers by the novel subsolid nodule classification.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/QualitativeCTCriterionforSubsolidNoduleSubclassification/1_1s20S1076633218300254.jpg)
