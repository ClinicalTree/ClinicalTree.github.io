## Rationale and Objectives

The sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of meniscal tears has been studied extensively, with tears usually verified by surgery. However, surgically unverified cases are often not considered in these studies, leading to verification bias, which can falsely increase the sensitivity and decrease the specificity estimates. Our study suggests that such bias may be very common in the meniscal MRI literature, and illustrates techniques to detect and correct for such bias.

## Materials and Methods

PubMed was searched for articles estimating sensitivity and specificity of MRI for meniscal tears. These were assessed for verification bias, deemed potentially present if a study included any patients whose MRI findings were not surgically verified. Retrospective global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was performed when possible.

## Results

Thirty-nine of the 314 studies retrieved from PubMed specifically dealt with meniscal tears. All 39 included unverified patients, and hence, potential verification bias. Only seven articles included sufficient information to perform GSA. Of these, one showed definite verification bias, two showed no bias, and four others showed bias within certain ranges of disease prevalence. Only 9 of 39 acknowledged the possibility of verification bias.

## Conclusion

Verification bias is underrecognized and potentially common in published estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of MRI for the diagnosis of meniscal tears. When possible, it should be avoided by proper study design. If unavoidable, it should be acknowledged. Investigators should tabulate unverified as well as verified data. Finally, verification bias should be estimated; if present, corrected estimates of sensitivity and specificity should be used. Our online web-based calculator makes this process relatively easy.

The efficacy of diagnostic tests is assessed by comparing them against a reference standard test (“gold standard”). Sensitivity and specificity are key indices of the efficacy of a test. However, the reference test may not be applied to all patients when it is expensive, painful, invasive, dangerous, or refused by patients. This can result in biased estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic test . This type of bias is called “verification bias,” “workup bias,” or “posttest referral bias.” Verification bias is a common problem in imaging research, particularly in retrospective studies. Verification bias is introduced if patients receiving the tests of interest are not equally likely to undergo the reference standard to verify their diagnosis and only those who receive the reference standard are included in the statistical analysis . Verification bias also occurs when an imperfect reference standard is used or when patients are verified using different reference standards in the same study .

The prevalence of verification bias in the medical literature has previously been estimated by several investigators. Greenes and Begg surveyed the medical literature between 1976 and 1980 and found that at least 26% of diagnostic efficacy studies had potential verification bias . Bates et al reviewed verification bias in the pediatric literature between 1987 and 1989 . Of the pediatric studies evaluating diagnostic tests, 36% were subject to verification bias. In a review of all diagnostic test studies published between 1978 and 1993, Cronin found that correction for verification bias was performed in 46% . This same study also found that the proportion of studies correcting for verification bias significantly increased over time: 29% between 1978 and 1981 to 62% and between 1990 and 1993. In a review of studies examining diagnostic tests for cancer published between 1990 and 2003, 40% at least mentioned verification bias as a potential source for bias . In our own recent review of four radiology journals, we found evidence of potential verification bias in 13%–36% (average 27%) of articles . This potential bias was acknowledged in only 17.1% of these articles.
