## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate whether a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) technique can accurately classify breast calcifications in full-field digital mammograms (FFDMs) as malignant or benign. The computer technique was developed previously on screen-film mammograms (SFMs) in which individual calcifications were identified manually. The present study evaluated the computer technique independently on a new database of FFDM images with automatic detection of the individual calcifications.

## Materials and Methods

We analyzed 49 consecutive FFDM cases (19 cancers) that showed suspicious calcifications. Four mammography radiologists read soft-copy mammograms retrospectively and electronically indicated the region of calcifications in each image. The computer then automatically detected the individual calcifications within the indicated region and analyzed eight features of calcification morphology and distribution to arrive at an estimated likelihood of malignancy. The radiologists entered Breast Imaging Report and Data System assessments before and after seeing the computer results. Performance was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic analysis.

## Results

Despite variability in radiologist-indicated regions of calcifications, the computer achieved consistently high performance taking input from the four radiologists (receiver operating characteristic curve area, A  z : 0.80, 0.80, 0.78, and 0.77; differences not statistically significant). Previous results showed that the computer technique achieved an A  z value of 0.80 on SFMs, which improved radiologists’ performance significantly.

## Conclusions

The computer technique appears to maintain consistently high performance in classifying calcifications in FFDMs as malignant or benign without requiring substantial modification from its initial development on SFMs. The computer performance appears to be robust with respect to variations in radiologists’ input.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non–skin cancer among women in the United States, with approximately 274,900 new cases (including carcinoma in situ) expected in 2006. It is the second leading cause of female cancer deaths, killing more than 40,970 women every year ( ). Early detection is important for reducing mortality from breast cancer and, currently, screening mammography is the most effective method for detecting breast cancer early. Recently, full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and computer-aided detection (CADe) have been adopted clinically as a possible improvement to the conventional screen-film mammography (SFM). FFDM offers potentially better breast cancer detection ( ) and better facilitates the application of CADe by eliminating the film-digitization process necessary for SFMs to be analyzed by a computer ( ).

Whereas the goal of CADe is to help radiologists detect suspect lesions in a mammogram, the goal of computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) is to help radiologists determine whether a breast lesion is malignant when the results of computer analysis of the mammogram are provided to the radiologist as a second opinion ( ). Previous research indicates that CADx can potentially help radiologists increase the number of biopsies performed on mildly suspicious but histologically malignant lesions and reduce the number of biopsies performed on mildly suspicious but histologically benign lesions, thereby improving, simultaneously, both sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic mammography ( ). Research ( ) suggests that CADe and CADx, together, could serve as an alternative to double reading by radiologists for improving the diagnostic accuracy and consistency of radiologists’ mammogram interpretation ( ).

Table 2


Algorithm for Computer to Estimate the Number of Calcifications Within a Region of Interest in which the Computer Makes Four Presumptions of the Number of Calcifications and then Determines the Most Likely Number Range Based on Detection Results Under Each Presumption


Presumed Number of Calcifications Detection Results Under Each Presumption 3–5 Close to 5 Close to 5 Close to 5 Any 6–10 Close to 10 Close to 10 Any Close to 6 11–30 Close to 30 Any Close to 11 Close to 11 >31 Any Close to 31 Close to 31 Close to 31 Most likely number range >31 11–30 6–10 3–5

_Note._ —When the computer detection results does not fit into one of these four patterns, the computer asks the observer to select a number range for the calcifications.
