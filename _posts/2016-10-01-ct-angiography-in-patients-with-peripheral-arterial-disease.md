## Rationale and Objectives

We investigated the effects of small focal spot (SFS) imaging and iterative model reconstruction (IMR) on the image quality of computed tomography angiographs (CTA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

## Materials and Methods

We divided 60 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed peripheral artery disease into two equal groups. One group underwent large focal spot scanning under our standard CTA protocol with hybrid iterative reconstruction (iDose  4 ) (protocol 1), and the other underwent scanning with the SFS protocol and IMR (protocol 2). Quantitative image quality parameters, ie, arterial computed tomography attenuation, image noise, and the contrast-to-noise ratio, were compared and the visual image quality (depiction of each vessel) was scored on a 5-point scale.

## Results

There was no significant difference in the arterial attenuation among all evaluated slice levels. The mean image noise was significantly lower under protocol 2 and the contrast-to-noise ratio was significantly higher at all slice levels. The visual scores assigned to the two protocols for the depiction of large vessels, such as the abdominal aorta and iliac artery, were comparable. However, the mean visual scores for small vessels in the lower extremities were significantly higher under protocol 2.

## Conclusion

CTA with SFS and IMR yielded significantly better qualitative and quantitative image quality especially for small vessels.

## Introduction

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common, chronic, progressive health problem . It affects up to 8.5 million (7.2%) Americans in their 40s and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality . The 5-, 10-, and 15-year morbidity and mortality rates from all causes in patients with PAD are approximately 30%, 50%, and 70%, respectively. Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of death amongpatients with PAD (40%–60%); cerebral artery disease accounts for 10%–20% of deaths . Early diagnosis and appropriate medical intervention can mitigate limb-specific symptoms, improve the quality of life, and decrease systemic cardiovascular risks .

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered the reference standard for diagnosing PAD. However, it is invasive and carries limitations and risks . Computed tomography angiography (CTA), a less invasive and safer examination, is an alternative to DSA and has gained widespread clinical acceptance for diagnosing PAD . Although CTA of lower extremities is more sensitive, specific, and accurate for assessing the location and extent of peripheral artery stenosis than DSA , its spatial resolution is inferior to DSA, and the visualization of small vessels, such as the peripheral small artery and collateral vessels, is suboptimal.
