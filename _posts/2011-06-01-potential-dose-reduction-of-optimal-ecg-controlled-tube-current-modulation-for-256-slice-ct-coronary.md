## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to design an optimized heart rate (HR)-dependent electrocardiogram (ECG) pulsing protocol for computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) on a 256-slice CT scanner and to assess its potential dose reduction retrospectively, based on the retrospective ECG gating data without dose modulation.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 137 patients were enrolled to perform CTCA with a 256-slice scanner. Two independent radiologists graded image quality of coronary artery segments (1 = excellent, no motion artifacts; 4 = poor, severe motion artifacts) to define optimal reconstruction window in end-systolic phase, mid-diastolic phase, and the combination of both cardiac phases. According to statistical analysis for HR against image quality, four HR-depended ECG-pulsing protocols were proposed. We also demonstrated the potential dose reduction of the proposed technique.

## Results

For patients with HR <59 beats/min (group 1), 60–72 beats/min (group 2), 73–84 beats/min (group 3), and >85 beats/min (group 4), the optimal reconstruction windows were at 74.1–81.3%, 73.4–82.2%, 38.3–82.3%, and 37.2–61.6% of R-R interval, respectively. The ECG-pulsing protocols with minimal radiation dose (ie, no tube current outside the pulsing window) can reduce the effective dose of CTCA by 79.5%, 75.7%, 38.3%, and 57.4% for HR groups 1 to 4, respectively. The corresponding results for reducing tube current by 80% outside the pulsing window were 63.7%, 56.6%, 32.0%, and 46.0%.

## Conclusion

Through the optimization of ECG-pulsed tube-current modulation, radiation exposure can be greatly reduced, especially in patients with HR <72 beats/min or >85 beats/min.

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) is highly accurate compared to invasive diagnostic catheterization . Various dose reduction techniques were introduced in CTCA to reduce exposure by approximately 25%–50% . A tube current modulation technique where the x-ray tube is turned on at predefined time points is called prospective electrocardiogram (ECG) triggering. Scheffel et al reported a mean effective dose range of 1.4–4.4 mSv for patients having heart rate (HR) range of 44–69 beats/min . Though this protocol can be applied to a limited number of sporadic arrhythmias , it is usually feasible for patients with monotonous cardiac rhythm and minimal heart rate variability (HRV). Another important strategy for dose reduction in CTCA is ECG-controlled tube current modulation (ETCM) . The tube current is only at maximum within the most quiescent phase of the cardiac cycle, whereas it can be reduced by 80% or more outside the pulsing window, depending if functional evaluation such as valve motion, wall motion or ejection fraction is desirable or not. A study of a dual-source 64-slice CT reported that mean effective dose of 33.4 mSv from CTCA without ETCM can be reduced to 11.0 mSv and 6.8 mSv when tube currents were set at 20% and 4% of the nominal value outside the pulsing window, respectively .

Radiation exposure of CTCA with ETCM technique on 64-slice and dual-source scanners has been investigated in several studies that demonstrated that an effective implementation of ETCM technique is highly dependent on the HR of patients and the temporal resolution of CT scanner. The recently introduced 256-slice CT offers temporal resolutions with a minimum of 135 ms. This scanner also provides z-axial coverage of 80 mm, allowing an acquisition time for the whole heart as low as 5 seconds for a 120-mm z-axial coverage . To the best of our knowledge, no similar study for a 256-slice multidetector CT (MDCT) has been reported yet. The purpose of this study was to design and implement an optimal ECG-pulsing protocol for a 256-slice CT scanner, and evaluate its potential in radiation dose reduction.
