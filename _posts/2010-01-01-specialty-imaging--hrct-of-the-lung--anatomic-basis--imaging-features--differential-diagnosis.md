This first-edition, comprehensive text of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging of the lung is a fabulous reference source for anyone involved in reading cardiothoracic CTs. It is a useful resource for learning HRCT imaging features, generating a differential diagnosis, and referencing a particular entity. The book is the collaborative effort between Dr. Gurney, four additional thoracic radiologists, and Amirsys, a leading provider of imaging informatics and diagnostic reference support for pathology and radiology. In fact, this text is presented in a style similar to STAT dx, another Amirsys creation and a friend to many a resident on call. The result is a comprehensive, well-organized reference text for the interpretation of HRCT.

The text is organized into five sections; normal anatomy, airways, lung, radiographic patterns, and pathologic injury patterns. The first section introduces the reader to the normal anatomy and physiology of the lung, providing a framework for distinguishing normal from abnormal. This section includes many graphic illustrations of lung and airway anatomy with complementary HRCT images. The first part of the section illustrates normal lung structure and the second part describes normal lung function. To delineate normal lung anatomy, the lung is divided into its various components, which include the secondary pulmonary lobule, airways, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, lymphatics, and normal inspiration and expiration. The lung physiology section, created to establish the basis of how physiology affects the distribution of disease, discusses cross-sectional physiology in relation to disease distribution and gravitational gradients.

The second and third sections, airways and lung, discuss numerous different disease processes. Each different disease includes several pages of radiographic and HRCT images of both typical and variant presentations. Many different examples are provided and each image includes an explanation of key findings. There is concise, bulleted text that includes terminology, imaging findings, pathology findings, clinical issues, and a differential diagnosis of each disease entity. There is also a highlighted box of key facts for each disorder, providing quick and easy reference. My only critique is that the book does not include a section devoted to pediatric lung disease, although some of the disease processes it covers certainly apply to pediatrics.

The final two sections, radiographic patterns and pathologic injury patterns, are a quick reference source for HRCT interpretation. The authors rank diseases from most common to most rare, providing a good starting point in formulating a differential. They again provide a comprehensive analysis of each lung disease entity with regard to pathophysiology, location, and HRCT findings and also provide helpful clues on how to narrow down the often extensive differential diagnosis for both the common and the rare entities. There are numerous very high quality plain film and HRCT images for each entity to illustrate their range of imaging characteristics.

This very well-organized and beautifully illustrated text is a helpful tool in successfully navigating the complex and often confusing world of lung disease and HRCT. The image quality is excellent and includes more than 1200 images. Use is made of the most current literature, which is cited for easy reference at the end of each disease entity discussion. As a bonus, purchase of the book includes Amirsys eBook Advantage for online access. Given that this book is somewhat cumbersome in size, it is probably better suited for use as an online reference. This book is an excellent resource for residents, fellows, radiologists, and medical students. Any chest reading room would benefit from a copy.
