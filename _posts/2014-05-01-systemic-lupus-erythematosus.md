## Rationale and Objectives

Many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) manifest the recurrence of new brain lesions on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We assessed whether the initial MRI findings help to predict the subsequent development of brain lesions in patients with SLE.

## Materials and Methods

We enrolled 64 patients with SLE who had undergone initial and follow-up MRI studies. Two radiologists reviewed and categorized the initial MRI findings and divided the patients into those with no lesions on the initial and follow-up MRI scans (group A, _n_ = 18), those with lesions on the initial scans only (group B, _n_ = 32), and those with lesions on the first and new lesions on the follow-up MRI scans (group C, _n_ = 14). We then looked for independent predictors of the subsequent development of brain lesions, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and findings on the initial MRI studies.

## Results

The incidence of lacunar and localized cortical infarcts was significantly greater in group C than group B (50% vs. 0%, _P_ < .001 and 50% vs. 9%, _P_ < .05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that lacunar or localized cortical infarcts on the initial MRI scans were independent predictors of the subsequent development of brain lesions (odds ratio \[OR\]: 5.412, 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 1.18–24.85, _P_ = .03), whereas the presence of APS was not (OR: 0.621, 95% CI: 0.18–2.19).

## Conclusions

The presence of lacunar and/or localized cortical infarcts on initial MRI scans may predict the development of new brain lesions in patients with SLE.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that frequently involves the central nervous system (CNS, . Neuropsychiatric (NP) SLE has been reported in as many as 30%–56% of all patients with SLE , and the quality of life is poorer in patients with NPSLE than without NPSLE . However, the etiology of and basis for NPSLE-associated brain lesions remain uncertain .

The development of NPSLE-associated brain lesions is related to disease activity and severity; one of the most important risk factors for brain lesions is the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and/or anticardiolipin antibodies (aPL, . Kaichi et al. showed that abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were more common in SLE patients with APS than without APS. The recognition of APS is critical for appropriate therapy. Antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy is recommended for NPSLE related to aPL, especially in patients with thrombotic cerebrovascular disease (CVD, . SLE patients without aPL are also potentially at risk for the recurrence of CVD .
