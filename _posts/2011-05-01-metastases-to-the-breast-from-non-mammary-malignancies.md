## Rationale and Objectives

Most secondary intramammary tumors occur as metastatic involvement from the contralateral breast. Breast metastases (BM) from nonmammary malignancies are very rare. The aims of this study were to estimate retrospectively the prevalence of BM from nonmammary malignancies and to describe their radiologic appearance.

## Materials and Methods

BM were identified in 51 patients, including 43 women and eight men with a median age of 61 years (range, 24–84 years). Computed tomography of the thoracic region identified 108 lesions in 38 patients. Mammography was available for 37 patients (54 lesions). Ultrasound evaluation was performed in 43 patients (71 lesions). In 24 patients (93 lesions), magnetic resonance imaging of the breast was done. Images were reviewed in consensus by two radiologists according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon.

## Results

The prevalence of BM in several tumors ranged from 0.12% to 4.92%. On computed tomography, most metastases were round or oval in shape with marked or moderate enhancement. On mammography, solitary or multiple round or oval masses with circumscribed margins were the most common pattern of BM. Ten percent showed microcalcifications. On ultrasound, most BM were hypoechoic, oval or round in shape, with microlobulated or circumscribed margins, and posterior acoustic enhancement. Doppler imaging showed hypervascularity in 39% of BM. On magnetic resonance imaging, most lesions demonstrated marked homogenous contrast enhancement. Type 1 kinetic curve was seen in 18%, type 2 in 52%, and type 3 in 30%.

## Conclusions

The radiologic features reported in this study should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions.

Most secondary intramammary tumors occur as metastatic involvement from the contralateral breast . Breast metastases (BM) from nonmammary malignancies are very rare . This may related to the fact that the breast contains large areas of fibrous tissue with a relatively poor blood supply .

Alva and Shetty-Alva found in their review of the literature that most BM arise from malignant melanomas, sarcomas, lung cancers, ovarian tumors, renal carcinomas, and thyroid tumors in decreased order of frequency . Some single-institution studies have suggested, however, that BM from ovarian and renal carcinomas are very rare .
