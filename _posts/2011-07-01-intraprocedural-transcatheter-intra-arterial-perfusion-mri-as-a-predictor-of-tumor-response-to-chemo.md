## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively test the hypothesis that transcatheter intraarterial perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (TRIP-MRI) measured semiquantitative perfusion reductions during transcatheter arterial chemoembolization of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with tumor response.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight patients (mean age 63 years; range 47–87 years) with 29 tumors underwent chemoembolization in a combined magnetic resonance interventional radiology suite. Intraprocedural tumor perfusion reductions during chemoembolization were monitored using TRIP-MRI. Pre- and postchemoembolization semiquantitative area under the time-signal enhancement curve (AUC) tumor perfusion was measured. Mean tumor perfusion pre- and postchemoembolization were compared using a paired _t_ -test. Imaging follow-up was performed 1–3 months after chemoembolization. We studied the relationship between short-term tumor imaging response and intraprocedural perfusion reductions using univariate and multivariate analysis.

## Results

Intraprocedural AUC perfusion value decreased significantly after chemoembolization (342.1 vs. 158.6 arbitrary unit, _P_ < .001). Twenty-six patients with 27 HCCs ( _n_ = 27) had follow-up imaging at mean 39 days postchemoembolization. Favorable response was present in 67% of these treated tumors according to necrosis criteria. Fifteen of 16 (94%) tumors with 25%–75% perfusion reductions showed necrosis treatment response compared to only 3 of 11 (27%) tumors with perfusion reductions outside the above range ( _P_ = .001). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that intraprocedural tumor perfusion reduction and Child-Pugh class were independent factors associated significantly with tumor response ( _P_ = .012 and .047, respectively).

## Conclusion

TRIP-MRI can successfully measure semiquantitative changes in HCC perfusion during chemoembolization. Intraprocedural tumor perfusion reductions are associated with future tumor response.

Early identification of tumor response to transcatheter arterial chemoembolization may facilitate efficient assessment of treatment efficacy, timing of repeat therapy, and patient prognosis. Radiological hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) response assessment by conventional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) typically occurs 1–3 months after chemoembolization. Although several studies have identified early vascular and cellular changes using dynamic-contrast enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI as potential markers for early tumor response assessment , few studies have explored intraprocedural functional imaging biomarkers that may objectively predict future tumor response at the time of chemoembolization procedures.

Intraprocedural MRI allows objective assessment of tumor functions during transcatheter liver-directed embolotherapies . We previously demonstrated that transcatheter intraarterial perfusion (TRIP)-MRI, which uses direct catheter-based intraarterial injections of gadolinium (Gd) contrast, may be clinically employed for intraprocedural monitoring and quantification of tumor perfusion changes during chemoembolization when performed in a combined MRI/digital subtraction angiography (DSA) unit (termed MR-IR suite) . TRIP-MRI serially monitors tumor contrast uptake during chemoembolization, providing reliable objective measurement of tumor perfusion before and after therapy .
