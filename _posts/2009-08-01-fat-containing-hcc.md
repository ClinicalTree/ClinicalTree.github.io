## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this article is to review the spectrum of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of fat containing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), including serial contrast–enhanced imaging.

## Materials and Methods

Imaging findings of 10 fat-containing HCCs on CT ( _n_ = 2) or MRI ( _n_ = 3) or on both CT and MRI ( _n_ = 5) were retrospectively reviewed in 9 patients. Both techniques included serial contrast enhanced imaging in arterial, portal venous, and late venous phases.

## Results

On non-contrast CT, fat containing HCC was either homogenously hypodense ( _n_ = 6) or of mixed density (n = 1). The density values ranged between −11 and 9 HU. On MRI, homogenous ( _n_ = 4) or heterogenous ( _n_ = 4) signal loss was observed on T1-weighted out-of-phase images as compared to in-phase images. Enhancement patterns on serial contrast–enhanced CT and MRI included: arterial enhancement indistinguishable from the liver with venous wash out ( _n_ = 2), arterial capillary blush with venous phase fading ( _n_ = 2), and heterogenous arterial enhancement with unenhanced foci and venous phase wash out of enhancements. Larger lesions had late capsular enhancement.

## Conclusions

Fat containing HCC has spectrum of imaging findings on CT and MRI. MRI with chemical shift technique depicts the fat content. Arterial contrast enhancement with venous washout or fading may help for the diagnosis of HCC in inconclusive cases.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may rarely contain fat. Histopathologic features and imaging findings of fat containing HCC have been investigated . Fat content may be the initial finding of HCC during its early development from small hepatocellular regenerative and dysplastic nodules; therefore, its diagnosis and differentiation from other fat containing liver lesions is important . Imaging findings of fat containing HCC have been described on computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ( ). The latter technique was shown to depict the fat content of HCC not recognized on CT images. Presently, patients are screened for focal liver lesions with the serial contrast–enhanced techniques that comprise arterial, portal venous, and equilibrium phases in both in MRI and CT .

In this report, we retrospectively review spectrum of imaging findings of fat containing HCC on CT and MRI with the use of current imaging techniques that include multiphase contrast-enhanced imaging of the liver.
