This book is an authorized, revised, and enlarged translation of the second German edition published and copyrighted in 2006 by the same publisher. It is a comprehensive text of the clinical and radiological management of breast diseases. _Diagnosis of Breast Diseases_ was largely written by a single author, Volker Barth, and has contributions from five colleagues at the Breast Imaging Center, Esslingen, Germany, and two specialists from a different institution. The authors provide the radiologist with the fundamentals of breast imaging for the differential diagnosis of breast diseases using a case-based approach with abundant illustrations, tables, photographs, mammograms, and ultrasound.

The book begins by discussing the various aspects of breast tumor biology, prognostic factors, and histology. Before moving on to the various pathologies of the breast, the authors provide us with an exquisitely illustrated review of the macroanatomy of the breast with histologic, mammographic, sonographic, and ductographic correlation. The multimodality correlation continues throughout the book as both preinvasive and invasive breast diseases are described. Although there are countless beautiful images in the book, some updated magnetic resonance imaging would have greatly improved the book.

The largest chapter in the book discusses various methods for early detection and accurate diagnosis through analog and digital mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and interventional procedures. There is a subsection on the imaging of various types of breast augmentation with multimodality imaging and anatomic/pathologic correlation. The interventional procedures section is divided into a diagnostic section and a perioperative section. The details of how to perform fine-needle aspiration, ductography, core needle biopsy, as well as vacuum-assisted core biopsy using sonographic, stereotactic, or magnetic resonance imaging guidance are described. Later on in the book, there is a thorough description of stereotactic/ultrasound-guided localization and sentinel lymph node scintigraphy. The book closes with an in-depth discussion of postoperative management of the breast cancer patient. Various complications of breast cancer treatment are presented using the case-based format.

A highlight of the book is the inclusion of material to aid the reader's learning. This includes easy-to-find color-coded tips and notes, as well as the question-and-answer style of some chapters of the book. The question-and-answer style can be a boon for readers who prefer this style of learning, and for readers preparing for their first or subsequent board examinations. Through these case-based discussions, the authors challenge the reader with difficult cases that effectively demonstrate the diagnostic dilemmas and forensic pitfalls in breast diseases.

The authors have tried to adapt the static traditional printed medium to allow greater reader interaction with case images by relying on a system in which the images are not annotated, but marked with a coordinate grid at their margins. The image captions identify the areas of interest by referring to the coordinate location on the image. For readers interested in testing themselves by using the cases as unknowns, this coordinate system provides an opportunity to interact with the images in a way that permanently annotated images cannot. The corollary, however, for those readers who may be less familiar with the imaging findings, is that the occasionally broad area denoted by the coordinate system may make it more difficult to identify the area of interest confidently. Readers may wish to consider their needs and preferences in having annotated or non-annotated images before purchasing this book.

Overall, this is a thorough review of the review of breast diseases. The multimodality approach and clinical correlation fits well with any breast imaging practice, the system of imaging captioning and annotation may not necessarily suit all readers' preferences.
