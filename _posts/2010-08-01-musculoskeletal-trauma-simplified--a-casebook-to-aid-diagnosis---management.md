This is a case-based textbook of musculoskeletal trauma. The intended audience is medical students and junior residents, particularly those in orthopedic surgery, emergency medicine, and radiology. Two of the authors, Amna Diwan and Shivani Gupta, are residents in orthopedic surgery and radiology, respectively. They collaborated with R. Malcolm Smith, Robert Perone, and Cornelia Wenokor, professors of orthopedics and radiology departments.

The book is organized by chapters of anatomic location, including the spine and all major joints, as well as pediatric trauma. Each chapter has two to 10 unknown cases. The reader is given a clinical presentation, much like a brief emergency room history, with mechanism of injury, Glasgow Coma Scale information, and pain complaints; a physical exam; and imaging, typically one or two plain films. There are then multiple questions regarding the diagnosis, classification system of the injury, and management. Following this is a discussion of the radiologic findings, in-depth answers to the questions, and usually more imaging from another modality or of similar injuries. A discussion of management issues then follows, and there are “Key Points” to summarize the case. An appendix of x-rays with normal results is also included.

This is an excellent textbook for learning the basic clinical evaluation, radiologic workup, assessment, and management of common musculoskeletal trauma. The cases are representative of what will be encountered in any emergency department. The questions are helpful for focusing on key concepts and testing the reader's knowledge base. The text is succinct, pertinent, and well written. The management discussions are informative and also well written. Image quality is excellent throughout the text.

This is a great case review for junior residents, particularly in orthopedic surgery, emergency medicine, and radiology. I particularly like that the authors included all aspects of medical delivery, allowing readers to understand the different components of the workup, even though they may ultimately be involved only in interpreting images or repairing fractures. This is invaluable information at the early stages of training, and the format allows readers to test their knowledge as they work through the cases. This would also be a great book for medical students on orthopedic, radiology, or emergency medicine rotations. Junior residents in these areas of medicine will also find this text useful for learning and referencing as they progress through their training.
