## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the performance of radiology residents in the interpretation of on-call, emergency “triple-rule-out” (TRO) computed tomographic (CT) studies in patients with acute chest pain.

## Materials and Methods

The study was institutional review board–approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Data from 617 on-call TRO studies were analyzed. Dedicated software enables subspecialty attendings to grade discrepancies in interpretation between preliminary trainee reports and their final interpretation as “unlikely to be significant” (minor discrepancies) or “likely to be significant” for patient management (major discrepancies). The frequency of minor, major and all discrepancies in resident's TRO interpretations was compared to 609 emergent non–electrocardiography (ECG)-synchronized chest CT studies using Pearson χ  2 test.

## Results

Minor discrepancies occurred more often in the TRO group (9.1% vs. 3.9%, _P_ < .001), but there was no difference in the frequency of major discrepancies (2.1% vs. 2.8%, _P_ = .55). Minor discrepancies in the TRO group most commonly resulted from missed extrathoracic findings with missed liver lesions being the most frequent. Major discrepancies mostly encompassed cardiac and extracardiac vascular findings but did not result in unnecessary interventions, significant immediate changes in management, or adverse patient outcomes.

## Conclusions

On-call resident interpretation of TRO CT studies in patients with acute chest pain is congruent with final subspecialty attending interpretation in the overwhelming majority of cases. The rate of discrepancies likely to affect patient management in this domain is not different from emergent non–ECG-synchronized chest CT.

In patients presenting with acute, undifferentiated, or atypical chest pain, computed tomography (CT) offers the possibility of ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease, pulmonary embolism, acute aortic syndrome, and other pathologies in a single comprehensive evaluation . This approach is commonly referred to as “triple-rule-out” (TRO) CT and is performed as an electrocardiography (ECG)–synchronized CT angiography (CTA) study of the heart or the entire chest . Evidence on the clinical utility of this approach is rapidly accumulating .

At the majority of academic institutions throughout the United States, preliminary interpretation of emergent diagnostic imaging studies in the on-call setting is provided by radiology trainees. On-call imaging studies are typically reviewed and finalized by subspecialty attending radiologists during normal business hours. For a number of imaging modalities and indications, a small but significant discrepancy rate between preliminary residents' and final subspecialists' interpretation has been demonstrated .

Most Common Sources of “Minor” Discrepancies in the Triple-Rule-Out Group

![Figure 1, Representative images from patients with discrepancies between residents' preliminary and final subspecialty attending interpretations rated as “minor” are shown. (a) Transverse computed tomography (CT) image demonstrates a liver lesion, which was missed by the on-call resident on this triple-rule-out (TRO) study. The patient was referred to magnetic resonance imaging which identified the lesion as benign focal nodular hyperplasia. (b) Transverse CT image demonstrates a small defect in the muscular portion of the interventricular septum likely unrelated to the patient's acute chest pain. This finding was not described in the on-call resident's preliminary report. (c) Four-chamber reformatted TRO CT study demonstrates mitral valve prolapse with leaflet thickening. This was not mentioned in the resident's report.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ResidentsPerformanceintheInterpretationofOnCallTripleRuleOutCTStudiesinPatientswithAcuteChestPain/0_1s20S1076633214001913.jpg)

![Figure 2, Representative images from patients with discrepancies between residents' preliminary and final subspecialty attending interpretations rated as “major” are shown. (a) The sagittal reformat of this triple-rule-out (TRO) computed tomography (CT) examination demonstrates a sternal fracture as the most likely cause of the patient's chest pain. This was missed by the on-call resident and later identified by the reviewing attending. (b) Transverse CT image demonstrates eccentric calcification and mild vessel wall irregularity of the left main coronary artery. The on-call resident interpreted this as a case of significant coronary artery stenosis, but it was assessed as nonsignificant by the subspecialty attending reviewing the case. (c) Transverse CT image demonstrates anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the left cusp with a “malignant” interarterial proximal course. This was missed by the on-call resident.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ResidentsPerformanceintheInterpretationofOnCallTripleRuleOutCTStudiesinPatientswithAcuteChestPain/1_1s20S1076633214001913.jpg)
