## Rationale and Objectives

The _h_ index is a recently developed tool to assess the impact of an author's publications. The purpose of this study was to apply and evaluate the _h_ indexes of US academic radiologists.

## Materials and Methods

Radiology programs that participated in the residency match in 2009 were identified through the National Resident Matching Program's Web site. One third of programs were randomly selected. The academic ranks (instructor, assistant professor, associate professor, professor, or chairperson) of faculty members were determined on the basis of information from the programs' Web sites during October and November 2009. One third of radiologists at each randomly selected institution were randomly selected for detailed analysis. For each radiologist, an automatically computed _h_ index was obtained through the Scopus database. The _h_ index was compared across ranks using analysis of variance. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed to determine the best predictors (number of publications, number of citations, _h_ index, and number of citations per publication) of academic rank.

## Results

Sixty hundred eighty-three radiologists from 47 programs were included in this study. The mean _h_ indexes were 1.1 ± 2.7 for instructors, 2.3 ± 4.1 for assistant professors, 6.2 ± 7.2 for associate professors, 12.5 ± 10.8 for full professors, and 12.0 ± 9.5 for chairpersons. There was a significant relationship between _h_ index and academic rank ( _P_ < .0001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that _h_ index ( _P_ < .0001) and number of publications ( _P_ < .0001) were the best predictors of academic rank.

## Conclusion

There exists a significant relationship between _h_ index and academic rank, with _h_ index increasing with academic rank. These results offer a benchmark for comparing a given academic radiologist to national averages.

Excellence in teaching, patient care, service, and research are important factors in assessing academic faculty members. In assessing excellence in research, publications, research grants, and resident and fellow mentorship are important factors in the assessment of physicians who work in an academic research setting. Perhaps the most important of these factors is the number of publications an academic physician produces. However, simply counting the number of publications a faculty member produces may not be an accurate means of assessing his or her performance as a researcher or impact on his or her research field. A number of calculated indexes have been proposed as a means of assessing a researcher's impact. These include the _h_ index, _m_ quotient, _g_ index, _m_ index, _r_ index, and _a_ index . Although there is debate regarding the accuracy of each of these indexes, it seems as though the new _h_ index is now increasingly in use .

The _h_ index was created in 2005 by Hirsch and has been applied to a number of scientific and medical fields. It is an appropriate tool to evaluate the combination of quantity and clinical significance of papers, because it depends largely on peers' citations of publications. Hirsch proposed “the index _h_ , defined as the number of papers with citation number ≥ _h_ .” For example, to calculate the _h_ index for an investigator with 10 total papers, one first ranks from highest to lowest the number of citations for each paper. If that list shows that five papers have been cited ≥5 times, that investigator's _h_ index is 5. The availability of the _h_ index in Scopus, the Institute for Scientific Information's Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar facilitates its widespread use.
