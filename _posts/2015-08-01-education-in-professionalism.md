Radiologist Saurabh “Harry” Jha still recalls the first time he was on call for radiology in the United States. He received simultaneous emergency requests for a head computed tomography (CT) and chest CT, both in the same patient, to rule out stroke and pulmonary embolism. The indication for the examinations was the same: syncopal episode. Jha was flabbergasted. “I thought to myself, there is no way we would do both examinations in the United Kingdom, so I called the ordering physician. I asked, ‘What are the patient's oxygen saturations,  d -dimer results, and Wells score?’ She sounded amused, and simply responded, ‘How is that going to help you find pulmonary embolism?’”

Jha's perplexity stemmed in part from the fact that, after graduating from a British medical school, he trained in surgery in the United Kingdom for three years and then practiced for a year in Australia. In those systems, resources were less plentiful, and radiologists were expected to be vigilant, asking hard questions to verify the appropriateness of imaging examinations. Now a faculty member at University of Pennsylvania, he has come to believe that the US health system encourages excessive rates of diagnostic testing, partly through its health care payment and medical malpractice systems.

Jha recalls another encounter that further illustrates this distinctively American approach to diagnostic testing. About 10 years ago at a state radiologic society meeting, he trumpeted the potential value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Seated next to him was a radiologist who shook his head sarcastically. “Are you kidding?” the man asked. “In the 90 minutes it takes you to do one cardiac MRI examination, for which you will not be paid, I could do six knee MRI examinations and get paid for every one. Who would want to develop cardiac MRI?”

To Jha, such stories are emblematic of one of radiology's greatest contemporary challenges. “Simply put,” he says, “we radiologists have priced ourselves out of doing anything. We have let the equation, ‘volume times price equals revenue’ so dominate our outlook that we have relinquished our role as true professionals.” Consulting with referring physicians to make sure that patients get the most appropriate care has often taken a back seat to generating as much revenue as possible. “And this,” says Jha, “is causing radiologists to lose control of imaging.”

Jha is referring to the fact that, in many radiology departments today, radiologists play no gatekeeper role, instead performing more or less any study as it is requested. In this situation, radiologists do little to ensure that imaging is used appropriately. The radiology department comes to resemble the pathology laboratory, which analyzes without question any blood or urine samples sent to it. Radiology tests are simply “ordered,” and the radiologist becomes little more than an image interpreter, having forfeited an important professional prerogative to ensure that imaging is used appropriately.

What is the solution? One important challenge, Jha believes, is for radiologists to reassert their control over imaging. “We can solve this problem overnight if each day larger groups would designate one or two radiologists to step out of the high-producer model and instead devote their time to meeting patients and consulting with referring physicians. Inevitably, radiologists who did so would be chided by their colleagues—‘While you were off schmoozing, I read 60 chest radiographs!’—but in the long run, radiologists could again show that they are in control of imaging.”
