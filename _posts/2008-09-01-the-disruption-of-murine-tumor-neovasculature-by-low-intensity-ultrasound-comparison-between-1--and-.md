## Rationale and Objectives

The goal was to determine whether the tumor vascular disrupting actions of low-intensity ultrasound were frequency dependent.

## Materials and Methods

The effect of the frequency (1 MHz at 2.2 W/cm  2 or 3 MHz at 2.4 W/cm  2 ) of low-intensity ultrasound as a neovascular disrupting modality was investigated in 15 murine melanomas (K1735  22 ) insonated for 3 minutes after the intravenous injection of a microbubble contrast agent (Definity). In contrast-enhanced power Doppler observations of each tumor (before and after treatment), measurements were made of the size of the area of the tumor that was perfused with blood containing the ultrasound contrast agent (percentage area of flow \[PAF\]), and the volume of contrast agent flowing through the unit volume of the tumor (color-weighted fractional area \[CWFA\]). During insonation of the tumor, the temperature was measured with a fine wire thermocouple in an additional eight mice.

## Results

The antivascular action of low-intensity ultrasound was significantly enhanced (PAF by 64%; CWFA by 106%) when the tumor was treated with 3-MHz ultrasound rather than 1 MHz (analysis of variance: PAF, _P_ = .02; CWFA, _P_ = .04). The average rate of tumor temperature increase was 2.6 ± 1.3°C/min for 1 MHz and 5.0 ± 1.7°C/min for 3 MHz; these increases were significantly different ( _P_ = .04).

## Conclusions

Insonation of the tumor at a higher frequency amplified the heating of the neoplasm and led to greater disruption of the tumor vasculature; 3-MHz ultrasound was more efficacious than 1 MHz for antivascular cancer therapy.

The influence of low-intensity physiotherapy ultrasound beams on the growth of neoplasms has been investigated. In a rhabdomyosarcoma in mice, it was found that the neoplasms receiving ten 5-minute treatments over 2 weeks with a continuous 3-MHz beam at 1 W/cm  2 grew at a faster rate than the control, untreated tumors ( ). Such an increase in growth may have been related to an enhanced angiogenic response similar to that observed after the insonation (15 or 30 minutes, 1.0 MHz, 20% duty cycle, 2.2 W/cm  2 ) of endothelial cells in tissue culture ( ). Subsequent rhabdomyosarcoma studies showed that 3-MHz beams of 0.75 W/cm  2 (continuous) and 1.5 W/cm  2 (pulsed) had no effect on tumor growth, and at necropsy, there were no histologic changes related to the therapy ( ).

As opposed to sonication alone, the combination of a microbubble-containing contrast agent and low-intensity ultrasound acted as a potent tumor vascular disrupting agent ( ). Treatment of a murine melanoma with a low-intensity beam (1 MHz, continuous, spatial average temporal average intensity (I  SATA ) = 2.3 W/cm  2 ) reduced tumor blood flow by 25% for each minute of insonation ( ). Contrast-enhanced Doppler imaging used in this study assesses blood flow by measuring the fractional area of tumor enhanced by the contrast agent and the magnitude of enhancement. These properties of Doppler images are intimately related to fractional blood volume or tumor perfusion; in this work, we have used these terms interchangeably.

Because the color level of pixels in the power Doppler image is related to the concentration of moving scatterers, CWFA is a measure of the volume of contrast agent flowing through the unit volume (voxels) of the tumor within the image plane.

The mean ± standard deviation of each of the temperature and TD measurements for each frequency were determined and the statistical significance of the difference between frequencies was established by an unpaired _t_ -test assuming unequal variances (MedCalc Software). Each mouse was euthanized at the completion of the experiment.

After therapy, the light gray blocks represent the mean size of the change in vascularity as measured by percentage area of flow (PAF), and the dark gray blocks as measured by color-weighted fractional area (CWFA). There were no significant changes in PAF or CWFA after the sham treatment. The analysis of variance, however, showed significant reductions in tumor blood flow (overall PAF, P = .002, overall CWFA, P = .001). After therapy with the 1- and 3-MHz low-intensity ultrasound beams (in comparison to the sham-treated group), the reductions were significant (1 MHz: PAF, P = .006, CWFA, P = .02; 3 MHz: PAF, P = .001, CWFA, P = .003). The increased antivascular effect of the 3-MHz treatment in comparison to the 1 MHz treatment was also statistically significant (PAF, P = .02, CWFA, P = .04).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/TheDisruptionofMurineTumorNeovasculaturebyLowintensityUltrasoundComparisonBetween1and3MHzSonicationFrequencies/1_1s20S1076633208002511.jpg)
