## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the breast cancer diagnostic capability of “dual-side readout” computed radiography–based mammography (DRCRM) with a 50-μm pixel size compared to that of conventional film-screen mammography (FSM).

## Materials and Methods

Thirty patients who were scheduled for surgical treatment for breast cancer and 10 normal volunteers were enrolled. All 30 patients underwent surgical treatment, and breast cancer was proved histopathologically. Twenty-eight patients had 35 invasive carcinomas, and the remaining two had ductal carcinomas in situ. Each of the 40 women underwent both DRCRM and FSM (with double exposure and the same view, without removing compression). Three observers retrospectively interpreted the mammograms independently and evaluated and rated masses and class categories. The accuracy of the detection of masses was evaluated with alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic analysis. Sensitivity for the detection of masses and of cancers was also evaluated.

## Results

The mean areas under the alternative free-response receiver-operating characteristic curves in the detection of the masses were 0.88 for DRCRM and 0.91 for FSM ( _P_ = .08). The corresponding values for mean sensitivity for the detection of masses were 0.74 and 0.77 ( _P_ = .48) and those for the detection of cancers 0.79 and 0.84 ( _P_ = .20).

## Conclusion

No significant differences were observed between DRCRM and FSM for diagnosis of breast cancers.

Over the past decade, various different digital mammographic systems have become available for clinical use . The main advantage of any digital imaging system is the separation of image acquisition, processing, and display, which allows for the optimization of these steps . One such system is a computed radiography (CR)–based mammographic system using photostimulated storage phosphor plates. In recent years, a computed radiographic system dedicated to mammography has been released. This system uses the “dual-side readout” technique, which collects emitted light efficiently from both sides of the storage phosphor plate . Dual-side readout CR-based mammography (DRCRM) allows for higher detective quantum efficiency, with an image sampling rate of 50 μm .

The evaluation of microcalcification findings is essential for the detection of breast cancers and to distinguish cancers from other, benign lesions. However, because the spatial resolution of 100 μm of most digital mammographic systems is inferior to that of conventional film-screen mammography (FSM), diagnosis with conventional digital mammographic systems has been considered to be at a disadvantage for the evaluation of microcalcification findings. However, DRCRM has twice the spatial resolution of other digital systems, which may help overcome the disadvantage of digital mammography for the evaluation of microcalcification findings.
