## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to measure the effect of _prevalence expectation_ as determined by clinical history on the diagnostic performance of radiologists during pulmonary nodule detection on adult chest radiographs.

## Materials and Methods

A multi-observer, counter-balanced study (having half the readers in each group read a different condition initially) was performed to assess the effect of abnormality expectation on experienced radiologists' performance. A total of 33 board-certified radiologists were divided into three groups and searched for evidence of malignancy on a single set of 47 postero-anterior (PA) chest radiographs, 10 of which contained a single pulmonary nodule. The radiologists were unaware of disease prevalence. Before each viewing of the same dataset, the radiologists were allocated to two of three conditions based on the differing clinical information (previous cancer, no history, visa applicant). Location sensitivity, specificity, and jack-knife free-response receiver operator characteristics figure of merit were used to compare radiologist performance between conditions.

## Results

A significant reduction in specificity was shown for the cancer compared to that for the visa condition (W = −41 P = 0.02). No other significant findings were demonstrated for this or the other condition comparisons. No significant difference in the performance of radiologists was noted when viewing images under the same conditions.

## Conclusions

This study suggested that there is a reduction in specificity with high compared to low prevalence expectation following specific radiological contexts. A reduction in specificity can have important clinical consequences leading to unnecessary interventions. The results and their implications emphasize the caution that should be placed on providing accurate referral criteria.

## Introduction

Previous research exploring the effect of making clinical information available to the radiologist's interpretation process has had mixed results. Berbaum et al. and White et al. have suggested that clinical information increases diagnostic accuracy, whereas other researchers concluded that it had no effect. Berbaum et al. further suggested that clinical prompts can influence search patterns, which may lead to a positive effect in the perception of certain abnormalities but a negative effect in others.

Although a number of studies, within the medical and nonmedical domains, have indicated that target prevalence can affect performance, there has been less research undertaken on the effect of prevalence expectation. Expectation bias occurs when expectations about an outcome influences a subject's behavior, which in radiology is a factor for almost every diagnosis. Additionally, they may also be influenced by the reading task, for example undertaking a reporting session for routine chest radiographs versus diagnosing images from a chest cancer clinic. One paper by Reed et al. explored this prevalence expectation issue using 30 postero-anterior (PA) chest radiographs with a consistent prevalence of 50% lung nodules. A total of 22 board-certified radiologists were asked to read the same image set twice, but only after they had been given explicit prior information about the prevalence, which was either the true prevalence (15 of 30), or a high (22 of 30) or a low (9 of 30) falsely stated prevalence rate. This varying prior information had little effect on diagnostic performance in terms of receiver operator characteristics values although the number of fixations and time spent interpreting each image increased at higher prevalence rates. However, Reed et al.'s research informed the radiologists of the prevalence of abnormal images for each read, which, unlike the present paper, does not reflect the clinical situation where the radiologists cannot know the true prevalence of abnormalities in the cases that they are about to report and, as such, do not address the problem of expectation.
