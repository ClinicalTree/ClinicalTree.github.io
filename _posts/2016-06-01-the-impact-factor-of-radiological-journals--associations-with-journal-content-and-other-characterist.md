## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the trends in the impact factor (IF) of radiological journals over a recent 12-year period, including associations between IF and journal topic.

## Materials and Methods

Journal Citation Reports (JCR) was used to identify all biomedical journals and all radiological journals (assigned a JCR category of “Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, & Medical Imaging”), along with journal IF, in 2003 and 2014. Radiological journals were manually classified by topic. Trends in median IF (mIF) were assessed.

## Results

The number of radiological journals increased from 83 (2003) to 125 (2014) (all biomedical journals: 5907 to 8718, respectively). mIF of radiological journals increased from 1.42 (2003) to 1.75 (2014) (all biomedical journals: 0.93 to 1.46, respectively). The most common topic among new radiological journals was general (nonspecialized) radiology (8). Five new radiological journals in 2014 were in topics (cancer imaging and molecular imaging) having no journals in 2003. mIF of general radiological journals was 1.49. Topics having highest mIF were cardiac imaging (2.94), optics (2.86), molecular imaging (2.77), radiation oncology (2.60), and neuroradiology (2.25). Topics with lowest mIF were ultrasound (1.19) and interventional radiology (1.44). Topics with the largest increase in mIF were cardiac imaging (from 1.17 to 2.94) and neuroradiology (from 1.07 to 2.25).

## Conclusions

Radiological journals exhibited higher mIF than biomedical journals overall. Among radiological journals, subspecialty journals had highest mIF. While a considerable number of new radiological journals since 2003 were general radiology journals having relatively low IF, there were also new journal topics representing emerging areas of subspecialized radiological research.

## Introduction

One measure of the quality of biomedical journals is their influence on subsequent research. Such influence on future investigations can, in turn, be measured via the frequency of citations to articles published within the given journal . While numerous strategies exist for quantifying the frequency of citations to a journal's articles, the most widely applied approach is the determination of the journal's 2-year impact factor (IF) , originally developed in 1951 . Thomson Reuters' Journal Citation Reports (JCR) updates journals' IFs on a yearly basis and makes this information publicly available though the online Web of Knowledge database . The IF is calculated as the number of citations occurring in a given year to the journal's articles during the previous 2 years divided by the number of citable articles in the journal during the same preceding 2-year period .

The IF has been applied to evaluate the quality not only of journals, but also the academic productivity of individual investigators, departments, and institutions . Although such practice has been criticized , the IF nonetheless has been applied in making determinations regarding hiring, promotion, tenure, and awarding of grant funding . Moreover, the IF has been used as a basis for inferences regarding the overall influence of research within a given discipline .
