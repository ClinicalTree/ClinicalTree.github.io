## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluates the validity and reliability of measuring the diameters of the thoracic and abdominal aorta from plain volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) images.

## Materials and Methods

The study included 50 male subjects from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania. They underwent imaging of the thoracic and abdominal aorta at 1.5 Tesla using a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) and plain VIBE sequence. Diameters were measured at five predefined anatomic sites from reformatted orthogonal CE-MRA images and axial plain VIBE images. The measurements were validated using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. The Bland-Altman method was also used to assess reliability.

## Results

Comparison of the diameters measured from CE-MRA and VIBE images revealed strong correlation for the ascending, descending, suprarenal, and infrarenal aorta with _r_ = 0.95 ( _P_ < .0001), _r_ = 0.88 ( _P_ < .0001), 0.92 ( _P_ < .0001), and 0.87 ( _P_ < .0001), respectively. Measurement for the aortic arch was moderately correlated with _r_ = 0.78 ( _P_ < .0001). Mean bias did not exceed 0.1 cm (6%). The 95% limits of agreement (LOA) were less than 0.5 cm (15%). Intra- and interobserver agreement showed a mean bias of less than 2%; the 95% LOA were less than 11%.

## Conclusions

Axial measurement of the diameters of the thoracic and abdominal aorta using a plain axial VIBE sequence is highly valid and reliable, making it suitable for use in epidemiologic research.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly popular in epidemiologic research. Ongoing population-based MRI studies such as the Rotterdam Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and the Framingham Heart Study include protocols for brain or cardiac MRI . A novel approach is pursued in the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP is an epidemiologic study that differs from the aforementioned studies in that the examinations performed in a large population of approximately 4000 subjects include a whole-body MRI protocol with optional administration of a contrast agent . The data from such population-based studies can be used to estimate the prevalence and incidence of risk factors and diseases and to identify the complex relationships that exist among them. In addition, such data can be used to measure organ dimensions and define normal values. Of particular interest are the diameters of the thoracic and abdominal aorta. Conditions characterized by dilatation of the aorta such as dissecting or true aortic aneurysm are common and a significant health issue because of a considerable risk of acute and potentially fatal complications. However, no definition exists to distinguish normal diameter variation from a pathologically enlarged aorta . Moreover, many physiologic and pathologic factors affecting aortic diameter have been identified, which are particularly well understood for the thoracic aorta . Recent studies investigating aortic dimensions used computed tomography (CT) or MRI data obtained in small or highly selected samples that are not representative of the general population . Population-based studies with inclusion of a large number of subjects can potentially overcome this lack, providing unbiased estimates of the diameters of the aorta.

In addition, most investigators measured diameters from axial imaging slices, a method that is simple but prone to overestimation compared with orthogonal diameter measurement (perpendicular to blood flow) . Orthogonal measurement requires image postprocessing, which is time-consuming when performed manually and for a large number of datasets. A simple, validated measurement technique is desirable for epidemiologic research. Ideally, such a method should enable measurement from MRI scans obtained without contrast medium administration, because stricter criteria apply to their use in volunteers participating in epidemiologic research .
