## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate and compare the accuracy of cross-sectional imaging using an intravascular antenna in the context of vascular morphological measurements performed during a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided vascular intervention.

## Materials and Methods

Cross-sectional imaging of a multimodality vascular phantom was performed using intravascular and surface MRI, multidetector computed tomography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Using a balanced steady-state free-precession sequence, 18 sequences parameters sets were investigated (12 for intravascular MRI and 6 for surface MRI). Vessel diameters for all images and modalities were computed using an automated vessel segmentation algorithm.

## Results

Using IVUS as a gold standard, imaging using an intravascular antenna leads to an increase in geometrical accuracy in comparison to traditional surface MRI. This level of accuracy appears to follow a significant inverse proportionality relation in respect to vessel wall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Taking into account the rapid decrease in SNR as a function of the distance to the intravascular antenna, these results imply that, for a given level of geometrical accuracy, faster sequences can be used for the imaging of smaller vessels.

## Conclusion

Imaging using an intravascular antenna appears as a valuable assistance to increase the accuracy of vascular morphological measurements. This increase in geometrical accuracy would be beneficial during the realization of an MRI-guided intervention, either to perform pretreatment measurements or to assess the outcome of the procedure. Acquisition parameters should be tailored to vessel size and procedural time constraints.

Atherosclerosis and arterial obstructive diseases are leading causes of death and impairment in Western countries. Imperative to an effective treatment of stenosis is an accurate estimation of the plaque burden and vessel morphology and a prediction of the plaque vulnerability. Because of its excellent soft-tissue contrast and flexibility, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used to detect and quantify stenosis and image atherosclerotic plaque, especially in superficial vessels such as carotid arteries .

In addition to the established diagnostic use of MRI with surface coils, several developments have been made toward the accomplishment of therapeutic vascular procedures under MRI guidance . In comparison to the standard clinical setup using x-rays, MRI offers a complete elimination of the use of ionizing radiation, a reduction in the use of nephrotoxic contrast agents, functional and anatomical information in three dimensions, and a significantly improved contrast between soft tissues. Several techniques have been proposed for the visualization and tracking of the interventional devices, generally relying on either a passive or an active approach. In a similar scope, active intravascular imaging coils have also been used for atherosclerotic plaque imaging and classification . However, to our knowledge, the benefits arising from the use of an intravascular coil allowing vascular imaging during a therapeutic procedure have not been completely investigated. Still, in such an interventional context, in which important time constraints exist, the higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) achievable with intravascular MRI could likely be advantageous to increase the accuracy and precision of morphologic measurements either before a procedure or to assess the therapeutic outcome.
