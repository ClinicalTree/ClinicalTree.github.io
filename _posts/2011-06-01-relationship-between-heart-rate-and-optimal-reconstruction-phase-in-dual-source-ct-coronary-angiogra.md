## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate reconstruction image quality at the systolic and diastolic cardiac phases and determine the optimal phase for reconstruction according to heart rate when using dual-source computed tomography (CT) with 75 ms temporal resolution.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the CT datasets of 35 patients with regular heartbeats who underwent coronary CT angiography. Images were reconstructed in 2% steps between 32 and 78% of the beat-to-beat interval. Two experienced radiologists determined the reconstruction interval with the fewest motion artifacts and the motion score of each vessel for the systolic and diastolic phases. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients having heart rates of <70, 70–80, and >80 beats per minute (bpm).

## Results

In the subgroup with heart rates of <70 bpm, the diastolic phase reconstruction image quality was significantly better than for the systolic phase ( _P_ < .01). In the 70–80 bpm and >80 bpm subgroups, no significant difference was observed. In the diastolic phase, the image quality of the <70 bpm subgroup was significantly better than for the >80 bpm subgroup ( _P_ < .05). In all systolic phase subgroups and other diastolic phase subgroups, no significant difference was observed.

## Conclusions

Using a DSCT scanner with 75 ms temporal resolution, reconstruction at the diastolic phases should be used for patients with heart rates <70 bpm. For heart rates >70 bpm, larger studies are necessary to determine whether reconstruction at the systolic, diastolic, or both phases should be used.

Recently, cardiac computed tomography (CT) has found widespread acceptance as a noninvasive imaging tool for the evaluation of coronary heart disease. In the past, the retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated helical scanning technique was usually used for coronary CT angiography (CTA) . However, in recent years the prospective ECG-gated scanning technique has found increased use thanks to developments in CT technology, leading to a reduction in radiation exposure . Furthermore, motion artifacts have been reduced through improved reconstruction techniques and improved temporal resolution made possible by faster gantry rotation speeds.

The recently introduced dual-source CT (DSCT) scanner is fitted with two sets of image acquisition systems (consisting of an x-ray tube and detector) arranged relative to each other at an angle of approximately 90°. Thus, if data from both detectors are combined, an almost 90° rotation of the gantry is sufficient to acquire the 180° projection data needed for image reconstruction. Moreover, the effective gantry rotation speed is increased. With these developments, the achievable temporal resolution using a half-scan reconstruction technique is as low as 75 ms in currently available systems and remains constant at all heart rates.
