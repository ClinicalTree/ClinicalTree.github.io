## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to describe the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of fat necrosis on magnetic resonance mammography, which may downstage a suspicious lesion to a merely benign finding.

## Materials and Methods

This prospective study included 82 female patients (mean age 50 years) who were diagnosed to have suspicious lesions by mammography, ultrasonography or both. All patients underwent MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging and spectroscopy. Image postprocessing and analysis included signal intensity, enhancement characteristics, diffusion restriction, and spectroscopic analysis. All patients underwent histopathological analysis for confirmation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative (NPV) predictive value were calculated.

## Results

To label a lesion as fat necrosis on MRI analysis, presence of fat signal in a lesion revealed sensitivity of 98.04%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPP of 96.88%, whereas nonenhancement of the lesion itself revealed sensitivity of 96.08%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPP of 93.94%. However, adding both the nonrestriction on diffusion analysis and the lack of tCholine at 3.22 ppm increased the sensitivity and specificity to 100%, as well as PPV of 100% for fat necrosis and hence a NPV for malignancy of 100%.

## Conclusions

MRI proved to be of value in differentiating fat necrosis from malignancy based on the molecular composition of fat necrosis, clearly depicted by MRI without the need for invasive confirmation by biopsy.

## Introduction

Fat necrosis is a benign non–suppurative inflammatory process of adipose tissue , initially described in the breast in 1920s . It is described as “an innocent lesion” in medical literature labeled as BI-RADS 2, which stands for totally benign breast lesion if it met its classical oil cyst form on mammogram. Nonetheless, it gained its notorious reputation and clinicians thrive to diagnose it accurately, as it is the number one differential diagnosis of an early breast cancer . Before the era of imaging and tissue biopsy, the treatment of choice was a wide resection of the breast .

Even with the advent of the different breast imaging procedures, fat necrosis still displays a wide spectrum of morphologic criteria on the different imaging modalities. This depends on the pathological stage of fat necrosis process, which depends on the balance of fat content and the degree of inflammation and fibrosis of the lesions .

At the end of the year, we ended up with 82 female patients (mean age ± SD: 50.10 ± 10.55, age ranging between 34 and 76 years), with 58 being suspected for postmanagement recurrence, whereas the rest were newly diagnosed lesions.

![Figure 1, A 44-year-old female patient with a history of right breast cancer managed surgically followed by chemo- and radiotherapy on periodic follow-up. Ultrasound examination ( a ) identified a linear hypoechogenicity matching with postoperative scar; 2 years later, follow-up ultrasound ( b ) revealed irregular stellate hypoechoic lesion, raising the suspicion of malignancy. Axial T1 non–fat-suppressed ( c ) and T2 fat-suppressed ( d ) images revealed marked focal fibrosis along the operative scar associated with few internal fat foci reflecting end-stage fat necrosis with maturing fibrous tissue. Postcontrast T1 subtracted ( e ) and MIP ( f ) images show negligible enhancement of the fibrosis with central nonenhancing fat foci confirming fibrosis maturation. Diffusion-weighted image ( g ) with b-value of 800 showed no evidence of diffusion restriction confirming the nonrestricted values on ADC map ( h ), endorsing the BI-RADS 2 class assigned to the lesion based on morphology and kinetics analysis and excluding suspicion of recurrence.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/FatNecrosisoftheBreast/0_1s20S1076633218300011.jpg)

![Figure 2, A 54-year-old female patient with a history of right breast cancer managed surgically followed by chemo- and radiotherapy on follow-up. Mammographic MLO view of the right breast ( a ) revealed upper outer quadrant focal asymmetry, and ultrasound ( b ) identified a suspicious focus within the operative bed. Axial T1 non–fat-suppressed ( c ) and T2 fat-suppressed ( d ) images revealed a markedly hypointense focus on both sequences along the operative scar associated with surrounding edema. No fat signal is identified, still marked signal void of hemosiderin deposition is the most likely cause. Postcontrast subtracted image for mean curve analysis ( e ) revealed focal enhancement of type I b progressive enhancement with delayed washout. No central nonenhancement identified, making the diagnosis equivocal for recurrence; still no choline trace was identified on spectroscopic analysis (f) , with the value of tCholine being zero at the 3.22 ppm point along the scale, endorsing the BI-RADS 3 class assigned to the lesion based on morphology and kinetics analysis and excluding the suspicion of recurrence. Diffusion-weighted image ( g ) with b-value of 800 and ADC map ( h ) showed no evidence of diffusion restriction, confirming the spectroscopic analysis and excluding recurrence. Low power microscopic examination of the lesion ( i ) shows multiple communicating fat cysts, hemorrhage, and a diffuse mixed inflammatory infiltrate (hematoxylin and eosin [H&E] ×100), higher power examination ( j ) shows large fat cyst surrounded by necrosis entangling karyorrhectic debris and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (H&E × 200). High power examination ( k ) confirms the inflammatory infiltrate formed by large foamy histiocytes (arrows), neutrophils, lymphocytes, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (H&E × 400).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/FatNecrosisoftheBreast/1_1s20S1076633218300011.jpg)
