## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to determine the appropriate body mass index (BMI)-dependent noise index (NI) setting in computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) with automatic tube current modulation with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 480 patients who had a CTPA were divided into group A (18.5 kg/m  2 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m  2 ), group B (25 kg/m  2 ≤ BMI < 30 kg/m  2 ), and group C (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m  2 ), according to their BMI values; each group had 160 patients. The three groups were further randomly divided into four subgroups: A1, A2, A3, A4; B1, B2, B3, B4; and C1, C2, C3, C4, with corresponding NI values of 26, 36, 40, and 46, respectively. All images were restructured with the ASiR algorithm, and the images with the lowest NI (26 Hounsfield units) in each group were used as reference standard. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for the pulmonary artery of each group were calculated. Subjective image quality was evaluated using a five-score method by two independent radiologists. The CT dose index of volume and dose-length product were recorded and were converted to effective dose (ED). SNR and CNR in the group A, B, and C subgroups were compared to repeated measures analysis of variance, and the subjective score, Volumetric CT dose index of volume, dose-length product, and ED were compared to one-way analysis of variance.

## Results

For groups A and B, the SNR, CNR, and subjective scores of the images in their subgroups showed no statistical differences ( _P_ \>  .05). The ED in subgroups A4 and B4 was significantly lower than that in subgroups A1 (by 33.24%) and B1 (by 34.47%) ( _P_ <  .01). For group C, there was no significant difference in the SNR, CNR, and the subjective image scores between subgroups C3 and C1 ( _P_ \>  .05). The ED in subgroup C3 was significantly lower than the ED in subgroup C1 (by 47.75%) ( _P_ <  .01)

## Conclusions

Patient BMI-dependent NI settings that are higher than the recommended value may be used in CTPA with automatic tube current modulation and ASiR to effectively reduce radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality.

## Introduction

Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is currently a widely accessible and quick to perform technique for patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism (PE) in clinic , and it has a high sensitivity (94%–100%) and specificity (89%–100%) for the diagnosis of acute PE . However, the amount of radiation exposure to the patient population in CTPA and its risks have also increased concerns regarding potential radiation damage . Thus, reducing the radiation dose on CTPAstudies has become a priority for radiologists. For clinical populations in particular, it is important to reduce radiation dose by reducing the tube current . The automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) technique selects the optimal tube current in an automated manner by using the attenuation values on anteroposterior and lateral scanogram, and it is an important method to reduce radiation dose. In one implementation of ATCM technique, the noise index (NI) value can be used to control the output of the tube current, so the NI is used as an indirect representation of image quality. However, reducing the tube current can increase image noise and adversely affect image quality. Higher image noise can be reduced by different advanced reconstruction algorithms in maintaining low radiation doses; adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASiR) is a widely used and effective way to reduce noise and maintain image quality .

To our knowledge, no one has compared image quality and radiation dose in CTPA for the combination of different NI settings and different body mass index (BMI) values. The purpose of our study was to determine the appropriate BMI-dependent noise NI setting in CTPA with ATCM and ASiR algorithm by comparing radiation dose and image quality to the combination of different NI values and BMI values to maximize dose reduction while maintaining image quality.
