Prior articles have reviewed reporting guidelines and study evaluation tools for clinical research. However, only some of the many available accepted reporting guidelines at the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research Network have been discussed in previous reports. In this paper, we review the key Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research reporting guidelines that have not been previously discussed. The study types include diagnostic and prognostic studies, reliability and agreement studies, observational studies, analytical and descriptive, experimental studies, quality improvement studies, qualitative research, health informatics, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, economic evaluations, and mixed methods studies. There are also sections on study protocols, and statistical analyses and methods. In each section, there is a brief overview of the study type, and then the reporting guideline(s) that are most applicable to radiology researchers including radiologists involved in health services research are discussed.

## Introduction

In 2006, the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) Network was formed to standardize and improve the quality of the reporting of health research with the development of research reporting guidelines. This article reviews how to report research in health care for the following study designs: diagnostic and prognostic studies, reliability and agreement studies, observational studies, experimental studies, quality improvement studies, qualitative research, health informatics, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, economic evaluations, mixed methods studies; and study protocols are discussed, as well as the reporting of statistical analysis. In each section, there is a brief overview of the study type, and then the available guideline(s) on how to report these different study types of health research are discussed. In this paper, we complete the review of the key EQUATOR reporting guidelines most applicable to radiology researchers including radiologists involved in health services research. The aim of this paper is to increase awareness in the radiology community of the available resources to enable researchers to produce scientific articles with a high standard of reporting of the research content and with a clear writing style. Where guideline checklists (and where applicable flow charts) are easily available from the EQUATOR Network Web site (or guideline statement Web site or other Web site), these Web links are provided. When guideline checklists are less easily available, they are summarized in tables.

## Diagnostic and Prognostic Studies

Diagnostic test accuracy studies evaluate a test for the diagnosis of a disease by comparing the test in patients with and without disease using a reference standard. Diagnostic test accuracy studies provide evidence on how well a test correctly identifies or rules out disease and informs subsequent decisions about treatment for clinicians, their patients, and healthcare providers . This research study design is one of the most commonly used in radiology research. Prognosis refers to the possible outcomes of a disease and the frequency with which they can be expected to occur. Sometimes the characteristics of a particular patient can be used to more accurately predict that patient's eventual outcome. These characteristics are called prognostic factors, and they can be used to predict outcome. Prognostic factors need not necessarily cause the outcomes, but may have a strong enough association to predict their development. Prognostic studies aim to predict the course of a disease following its onset. A prediction model is a mathematical equation that combines information from multiple predictors measured from an individual to predict the probability of the presence (diagnosis) or future occurrence (prognosis) of a particular disease or outcome. Other names for a prediction model include risk prediction model, predictive model, prediction rule, and risk score . The EQUATOR Network has recently changed its study type section from a section for diagnostic test accuracy studies to a section that includes both diagnostic and prognostic studies. Currently, there are nine reporting guidelines for this section with the key reporting guidelines being STAndards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy (STARD) 2015 and Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis (TRIPOD).

## Toward Complete and Accurate Reporting of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy: The STARD Initiative

This is a reporting guideline for studies of diagnostic accuracy . The objective of the STARD initiative is to improve the accuracy and completeness of reporting of studies of diagnostic accuracy, to allow readers to assess the potential for bias in the study (internal validity) and to evaluate its generalizability (external validity) . The initial STARD statement (now known as STARD 2003) consisted of a checklist of 25 items. The STARD statement has been recently updated with the updated statement known as STARD 2015. In STARD 2015, the updated list now contains 30 essential items that should be included in every report of a diagnostic accuracy study. A summary of new items in STARD 2015 is shown in  Table 1 . This update incorporates recent evidence about sources of bias and variability in diagnostic accuracy studies. The statement also recommends the use of a flow diagram that describes the design of the study and the flow of patients . It is hoped that STARD 2015 will help to improve completeness and transparency in the reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies. More than 200 biomedical journals encourage the use of the STARD statement in their instructions for authors . This has been covered in depth in an article in the previous Radiology Alliance for Health Services Research (RAHSR) edition . The STARD and STARD 2015 checklist and flow diagram are available to download from the STARD Web site and the EQUATOR Network .

TABLE 1


Summary of New Items in STARD 2015


# Section and Topic Item Checklist Item and Rationale 2**Abstract**

Structured abstract Abstracts are increasingly used to identify key elements of study design and results. 3**Introduction**

Intended use and clinical role of the test Describing the targeted application of the test helps readers to interpret the implications of reported accuracy estimates. 4**Introduction**

Study hypotheses Not having a specific study hypothesis may invite generous interpretation of the study results and “spin” in the conclusions. 18**Methods**

Sample size Readers want to appreciate the anticipated precision and power of the study and whether authors were successful in recruiting the targeted number of participants. 26–27**Discussion**

Structured discussion To prevent jumping to unwarranted conclusions, authors are invited to discuss study limitations and draw conclusions keeping in mind the targeted application of the evaluated tests (see item 3). 28**Other information**

Registration Prospective test accuracy studies are trials, and, as such, they can be registered in clinical trial registries, such as  ClinicalTrials.gov  , before their initiation, facilitating identification of their existence and preventing selective reporting. 29**Other information**

Protocol The full study protocol, with more information about the predefined study methods, may be available elsewhere, to allow more fine-grained critical appraisal. 30**Other information**

Sources of funding Awareness of the potentially compromising effects of conflicts of interest between researchers' obligations to abide by scientific and ethical principles and other goals, such as financial ones; test accuracy studies are no exception.

STARD, STAndards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy.


## TRIPOD

The TRIPOD Statement is an evidence-based, minimum set of recommendations for the reporting of both diagnostic and prognostic prediction modeling studies. It comprises a 22-item checklist that focuses on reporting how the study was designed, conducted, analyzed, and interpreted. The main components of the TRIPOD checklist are available to download from the TRIPOD Web site and the EQUATOR Network . It is hoped that this will aid their critical appraisal, interpretation, and uptake by potential users. On January 6, 2015, 11 journals simultaneously published the TRIPOD Statement . It is endorsed by a large number of prominent general medical journals and leading editorial organizations.

TABLE 6


Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys (CHERRIES)


Section and Topic Item # Checklist Item Explanation Design 1 Describe survey design Describe target population, sample frame. Is the sample a convenience sample? (In “open” surveys, this is most likely.) Institutional review board (IRB) approval and informed consent process 2 IRB approval Mention whether the study has been approved by an IRB. 3 Informed consent Describe the informed consent process. Where were the participants told the length of time of the survey, which data were stored and where and for how long, who was the investigator, and what was the purpose of the study? 4 Data protection If any personal information was collected or stored, describe what mechanisms were used to protect unauthorized access. Development and pretesting 5 Development and testing State how the survey was developed, including whether the usability and the technical functionality of the electronic questionnaire had been tested before fielding the questionnaire. Recruitment process and description of the sample having access to the questionnaire 6 Open survey versus closed survey An “open survey” is a survey open for each visitor of a site, whereas a closed survey is only open to a sample that the investigator knows (password-protected survey). 7 Contact mode Indicate whether the initial contact with the potential participants was made on the Internet. (Investigators may also send out questionnaires by mail and allow for Web-based data entry.) 8 Advertising the survey How/where was the survey announced or advertised? Some examples are off-line media (newspapers), or online (mailing lists—If yes, which ones?) or banner ads (Where were these banner ads posted and what did they look like?). It is important to know the wording of the announcement as it will heavily influence who chooses to participate. Ideally, the survey announcement should be published as an appendix. Survey administration 9 Web/E-mail State the type of e-survey (eg, one posted on a Web site, or one sent out through e-mail). If it is an e-mail survey, were the responses entered manually into a database, or was there an automatic method for capturing responses? 10 Context Describe the Web site (for mailing list/newsgroup) in which the survey was posted. What is the Web site about, who is visiting it, and what are visitors normally looking for? Discuss to what degree the content of the Web site could preselect the sample or influence the results. For example, a survey about vaccination on a anti-immunization Web site will have different results from a Web survey conducted on a government Web site. 11 Mandatory/voluntary Was it a mandatory survey to be filled in by every visitor who wanted to enter the Web site, or was it a voluntary survey? 12 Incentives Were any incentives offered (eg, monetary, prizes, or nonmonetary incentives such as an offer to provide the survey results)? 13 Time/Date In what time frame were the data collected? 14 Randomization of items or questionnaires To prevent biases, items can be randomized or alternated. 15 Adaptive questioning Use adaptive questioning (certain items, or only conditionally displayed based on responses to other items) to reduce number and complexity of the questions. 16 Number of items What was the number of questionnaire items per page? The number of items is an important factor for the completion rate. 17 Number of screens (pages) Over how many pages was the questionnaire distributed? The number of items is an important factor for the completion rate. 18 Completeness check It is technically possible to do consistency or completeness checks before the questionnaire is submitted. Was this done, and if “yes,” how (usually JAVAScript)? An alternative is to check for completeness after the questionnaire has been submitted (and highlight mandatory items). If this has been done, it should be reported. All items should provide a nonresponse option such as “not applicable” or “rather not say,” and selection of one response option should be enforced. 19 Review step State whether respondents were able to review and change their answers (eg, through a back button or a review step that displays a summary of the responses and asks the respondents if they are correct). Response rates 20 Unique site visitor If you provide view rates or participation rates, you need to define how you determined a unique visitor. There are different techniques available, based on IP addresses or cookies or both. 21 View rate (ratio of unique survey visitors/unique site visitors) Requires counting unique visitors to the first page of the survey, divided by the number of unique site visitors (not page views!). It is not unusual to have view rates of less than 0.1% if the survey is voluntary. 22 Participation rate (ratio of unique visitors who agreed to participate/unique first survey page visitors) Count the unique number of people who filled in the first survey page (or agreed to participate, for example, by checking a checkbox), divided by visitors who visit the first page of the survey (or the informed consents page, if present). This can also be called “recruitment” rate. 23 Completion rate (ratio of users who finished the survey/users who agreed to participate) The number of people submitting the last questionnaire page, divided by the number of people who agreed to participate (or submitted the first survey page). This is only relevant if there is a separate “informed consent” page or if the survey goes over several pages. This is a measure for attrition. Note that “completion” can involve leaving questionnaire items blank. This is not a measure for how completely questionnaires were filled in. (If you need a measure for this, use the word “completeness rate.”) Preventing multiple entries from the same individual 24 Cookies used Indicate whether cookies were used to assign a unique user identifier to each client computer. If so, mention the page on which the cookie was set and read, and how long the cookie was valid. Were duplicate entries avoided by preventing users' access to the survey twice, or were duplicate database entries having the same user ID eliminated before analysis? In the latter case, which entries were kept for analysis (eg, the first entry or the most recent)? 25 IP check Indicate whether the IP address of the client computer was used to identify potential duplicate entries from the same user. If so, mention the period of time for which no two entries from the same IP address were allowed (eg, 24 hours). Were duplicate entries avoided by preventing users with the same IP address access to the survey twice, or were duplicate database entries having the same IP address within a given period of time eliminated before analysis? If the latter, which entries were kept for analysis (eg, the first entry or the most recent)? 26 Log file analysis Indicate whether other techniques to analyze the log file for identification of multiple entries were used. If so, please describe. 27 Registration In “closed” (nonopen) surveys, users need to log in first and it is easier to prevent duplicate entries from the same user. Describe how this was done. For example, was the survey never displayed a second time once the user had filled it in, or was the username stored together with the survey results and later eliminated? If the latter, which entries were kept for analysis (eg, the first entry or the most recent)? Analysis 28 Handling of incomplete questionnaires Were only completed questionnaires analyzed? Were questionnaires that terminated early (where, for example, users did not go through all questionnaire pages) also analyzed? 29 Questionnaires submitted with an atypical time stamp Some investigators may measure the time people needed to fill in a questionnaire and exclude questionnaires that were submitted too soon. Specify the time frame that was used as a cutoff point, and describe how this point was determined. 30 Statistical correction Indicate whether any methods such as weighting of items or propensity scores have been used to adjust for the nonrepresentative sample; if so, please describe the methods.
