The introduction of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT), single photon-emission CT/CT, and software packages for multimodality imaging has accelerated the need for nuclear medicine physicians to obtain more training in cross-sectional imaging, especially in CT. In recent years, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the American Board of Radiology, and the American Board of Nuclear Medicine have promulgated new rules and regulations. In addition, the Society of Nuclear Medicine, the American College of Radiology, and the American College of Cardiology Foundation have crafted new guidelines and training requirements. All these changes have consequences for the education of physicians in nuclear medicine. Self-referral and concerns about radiation exposure from nuclear medicine examinations and CT are also affecting the education of physicians practicing nuclear medicine. The authors examine the impact of these developments on training and certification in nuclear medicine and suggest another pathway to train some nuclear medicine physicians.

Computed tomography (CT) has excellent spatial resolution but is not always a good predictor of tissue behavior. For many tumors, whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) has several advantages over regional CT, including illustrating areas of pathology on the basis of abnormal metabolism before a lesion is evident anatomically, better staging, quicker assessment of the response to therapy, and imaging the whole body to discover areas where abnormalities were unexpected. With PET, it is often possible to predict if an enlarged node is likely to contain a significant number of malignant cells within it or to be a benign node or a node that has had the malignant cells within it destroyed by therapy. Combined modalities such as PET/CT and single photon-emission CT (SPECT)/CT have resulted in better diagnostic tools than each modality alone because there is better anatomic localization and accuracy of diagnosis. Other uses of 2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET/CT include evaluating a solitary pulmonary nodule, radiation therapy planning, infection or inflammation studies, cardiac imaging, predicting the response of tumors to chemotherapy, and neurologic imaging ( ).

PET/CT is currently one of the fastest growing imaging techniques. Furthermore, there are numerous radiopharmaceuticals other than 2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose that can be used in PET ( ). It is believed that there will soon be commercially available PET/magnetic resonance (MR) units ( ). Images of the brain using simultaneous PET/MR have been produced ( ). Many believe that there is tremendous potential for PET/MR ( ). Even if this expected development does not find widespread application, the growth of MR alone, and multimodality fusion software, will stimulate more study of MR by nuclear medicine physicians in the future. Instrumentation and software advances will require that nuclear medicine physicians learn more about cross-sectional imaging and that radiologists learn more about nuclear medicine ( ).

## Board and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements

Changes by the Nuclear Medicine Residency Review Committee that became effective in July 2007 included a requirement that, for those who are doing 2- or 3-year residencies in nuclear medicine, there be “a minimum of 4 months of CT experience that may be combined with a rotation that includes PET-CT or SPECT-CT, although rotation on a CT service is desirable for part of the training.” Those who have already fulfilled the requirements of a radiology residency are excused from this requirement ( ). For a nuclear medicine resident to have a dedicated rotation in CT will require cooperation from the radiology department of his or her program's institution ( ). In the coming years, there will be a need to require more training in molecular imaging, both clinically and in research ( ).

Completing a nuclear radiology fellowship program is no longer sufficient for eligibility for taking the American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM) examination, unless the nuclear radiology program is also certified as a nuclear medicine residency program. This is because of the different requirements of nuclear radiology and nuclear medicine residency programs in therapy ( ).

There is a rarely used pathway to ABNM eligibility with the American Board of Internal Medicine. For this, a candidate must take 2.5 years of internal medicine and 1.5 years of nuclear medicine and obtain preapproval from the ABNM ( ).
