## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to validate a projection-domain lesion-insertion method with observer studies.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 51 proven liver lesions were segmented from computed tomography images, forward projected, and inserted into patient projection data. The images containing inserted and real lesions were then reconstructed and examined in consensus by two radiologists. First, 102 lesions (51 original, 51 inserted) were viewed in a randomized, blinded fashion and scored from 1 (absolutely inserted) to 10 (absolutely real). Statistical tests were performed to compare the scores for inserted and real lesions. Subsequently, a two-alternative-forced-choice test was conducted, with lesions viewed in pairs (real vs. inserted) in a blinded fashion. The radiologists selected the inserted lesion and provided a confidence level of 1 (no confidence) to 5 (completely certain). The number of lesion pairs that were incorrectly classified was calculated.

## Results

The scores for inserted and proven lesions had the same median (8) and similar interquartile ranges (inserted, 5.5–8; real, 6.5–8). The mean scores were not significantly different between real and inserted lesions ( _P_ value = 0.17). The receiver operating characteristic curve was nearly diagonal, with an area under the curve of 0.58 ± 0.06. For the two-alternative-forced-choice study, the inserted lesions were incorrectly identified in 49% (25 out of 51) of pairs; radiologists were incorrect in 38% (3 out of 8) of pairs even when they felt very confident in identifying the inserted lesion (confidence level ≥4).

## Conclusions

Radiologists could not distinguish between inserted and real lesions, thereby validating the lesion-insertion technique, which may be useful for conducting virtual clinical trials to optimize image quality and radiation dose.

## Introduction

To optimize computed tomography (CT) image quality and radiation dose for liver lesion detection tasks, patient images containing proven liver lesions are required. Proof of lesion presence and etiology may be obtained from biopsy, surgical extirpation, or regression or progression of hepatic disease on cross-sectional imaging in patients with known hepatic malignancy. Although images containing proven liver lesions can be collected via clinical trials, the process is time-consuming and expensive. An alternative to conventional clinical trials is a virtual clinical trial, which acquires images by inserting lesions into patient images at specified locations. With virtual clinical trials, the image data collection process becomes substantially more time-efficient and less costly. Moreover, creating images containing inserted lesions would permit control of lesion characteristics and locations.

The pathway toward a virtual clinical trial in low-dose liver CT would necessitate several milestones, including (1) the ability to insert lesions into designated locations to ensure that lesions obey anatomic boundaries, (2) that inserted and actual proven liver lesions appear indistinguishable to experienced radiologists, and (3) that lesion detection and characterization for the inserted and real lesions are similar over a range of acquisition and reconstruction conditions. A lesion-insertion method has been recently developed , which inserts lesions via the projection domain (ie, before the image reconstruction) and is compatible with a state-of-the-art commercial CT scanner in both axial and helical modes, with various tube potential settings and focal spot movement patterns. The projection-domain insertion method is more sophisticated than conventional image domain (ie, after the image reconstruction) lesion-insertion methods because the resulting inserted lesions reflect the impact of reconstruction method and parameters on lesion appearance, which is critical to the evaluation of lower dose images with iterative reconstruction.
