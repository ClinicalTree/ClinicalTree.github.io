## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to apply a decision analytic model for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) to define the optimal utilization of coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) and stress testing.

## Materials and Methods

The model tested in this study assumes that CAD is evaluated with a stress test and/or cCTA and that a patient with positive evaluation results undergoes cardiac catheterization. On the basis of values of sensitivity, specificity, and radiation dose from the published literature and test costs from the Medicare fee schedule, a decision tree model was constructed as a function of disease prevalence.

## Results

The false-negative rate is lowest when cCTA is used as an isolated test. The false-positive rate is minimized when cCTA is used in combination with stress echocardiography. Effective radiation is minimized by use of stress electrocardiography or stress echocardiography alone or prior to cCTA. When the pretest probability of CAD is low, a strategy that uses stress echocardiography followed by cCTA minimizes the false-positive rate and effective radiation exposure, with relatively low imaging costs and with a false-negative rate only slightly higher than a strategy including stress myocardial scintigraphy. As the pretest probability of CAD increases above 20%, the false-negative rate of stress echocardiography followed by cCTA increases by >5% relative to cCTA alone.

## Conclusion

Effective radiation dose and imaging costs for the workup of CAD may be minimized by an appropriate combination of stress testing and cCTA. A strategy that uses stress echocardiography followed by cCTA is most appropriate for the evaluation of low-risk patients with CAD with a pretest probability < 20%, while cCTA alone may be more appropriate in intermediate-risk patients.

Although the age-adjusted death rate from heart disease has been declining slowly over the past 50 years, heart disease remains the most common cause of death in the United States and was responsible for 26% of all deaths in 2006 . Atherosclerotic disease of the coronary arteries remains the most important etiology of heart disease. The evaluation of suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) should always begin with an appropriate history, physical examination, and electrocardiography (ECG). In stable, symptomatic patients, evaluation for CAD often progresses to noninvasive stress testing. Stress testing provides a physiologic evaluation of cardiac function and serves as a diagnostic study and prognostic marker for future coronary events .

Coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) provides a noninvasive alternative to cardiac catheterization for the visualization of coronary anatomy and has demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the anatomic presence of CAD . Although functional information about wall motion can be obtained during cCTA, the primary utility of cCTA is for imaging the coronary arteries to define the presence of CAD. Stress testing provides additional information to predict the functional relevance of coronary stenosis with respect to myocardial ischemia . When cCTA demonstrates coronary stenosis of uncertain hemodynamic significance, a follow-up stress test may evaluate the functional significance of CAD found by cCTA. Given the divergent emphases of stress testing on functional physiology and cCTA on coronary anatomy, these two modalities may provide complementary information in the evaluation of CAD .

![Figure 1, Decision tree for the workup of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD). The decision tree begins on the left side with a decision node (rectangular box), in which a CAD workup strategy is chosen. The option at the very top of the tree corresponds to no advanced testing, such that all patients are treated medically (medical Rx). The option at the bottom of the tree corresponds to cardiac catheterization (cath) for all patients. The remaining workup options include evaluation with a stress test and/or coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA). Each noninvasive test is identified by a round “chance” node that uses the sensitivity and specificity associated with the test to propagate positive and negative detection rates down the tree. At the terminal points of the tree (arrows), the effective radiation dose and imaging cost for each pathway are computed. The focus of this study is to distinguish the strengths and weaknesses of these various workup options.
