## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to retrospectively evaluate whether computed tomographic (CT) parameters were predictors of in-hospital mortality within 30 days of CT imaging and to compare CT parameters with clinical, echocardiographic, and laboratory findings in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 122 patients (61 women, 61 men; mean age, 64 ± 15 years) with CT scans positive for acute PE were reviewed. Two independent readers who were blinded to clinical outcomes scored pulmonary artery obstructions, evaluated cardiovascular measurements, and assessed qualitative findings. Reports of echocardiographic, clinical, and laboratory findings and clinical outcome were reviewed. Results were correlated with patient outcomes using Wilcoxon’s rank-sum, χ  2 , and Student’s _t_ tests. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictors of patient outcomes.

## Results

Thirteen patients (11%) died related to PE within 30 days in the hospital. There were significant differences in the ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen and in heart rate between survivors and nonsurvivors ( _P_ < .05). No CT or echocardiographic predictor was associated with mortality.

## Conclusions

The ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fraction of oxygen and heart rate strongly predicted mortality due to PE. Neither CT pulmonary angiographic variables nor echocardiography could successfully predict in-hospital mortality in patients with acute PE.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal disease, with an overall 30-day mortality rate that exceeds 10% . Although most late deaths are due to underlying disease, such as cancer, chronic lung disease, or congestive heart failure, the main cause of death within 30 days is right ventricular (RV) failure . Rapid risk stratification is paramount for identifying high-risk patients and helps select the appropriate treatment strategy. Thrombolysis , catheter intervention , or surgical embolectomy as adjuncts to anticoagulation may rapidly reverse RV failure and reduce the risk for recurrence and death. In recent years, many attempts have been made to stratify patients according to their risk for death due to acute PE. From the results of large retrospective registries and randomized trials of thrombolytic agents, clinical presentation is considered the most powerful predictor of death due to PE . However, there have been attempts to further risk-stratify patients with imaging. With the development of narrow collimation, multi–detector row computed tomographic (CT) imaging, and modern workstations for image postprocessing and analysis, CT pulmonary angiography is being recommended as the modality of choice for the assessment of patients with pulmonary emboli .

Several retrospective studies have investigated the relationships between pulmonary artery (PA) obstruction score, cardiovascular parameters, and patient outcomes . On the other hand, several reports have suggested that some clinical and laboratory parameters, such as arterial blood gas measurements and troponin T, are prognostic findings in patients with acute PE . However, conflicting conclusions are present between these studies. Furthermore, none of the existing CT studies have attempted to control for clinical presentation variables or echocardiographic and laboratory findings. Thus, the aims of our study were to retrospectively evaluate whether CT quantitative and qualitative parameters were predictors of in-hospital mortality within 30 days of CT imaging and to compare CT parameters with echocardiographic, clinical, and laboratory findings in patients with acute PE.
