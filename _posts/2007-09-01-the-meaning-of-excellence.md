## Rationale and Objectives

Program directors would like to interview the very best students applying to their programs. The summary paragraph of the dean’s letter should provide useful information regarding a student’s performance in medical school. One frequently found descriptor is _excellent._ However, its very frequency suggests the word may be loosely used. The purpose of this investigation is to determine the meaning of excellence.

## Materials and Methods

The descriptor _excellent_ was searched for in the summary paragraph. An effort was made to determine how many medical schools used _excellent_ , how precisely the medical school defined this word, whether numbers were used to define the upper and lower boundaries of _excellent_ , and what other buzzwords were used in the summary paragraphs for students not defined as _excellent._

## Results

_Excellent_ was the most common descriptor, used by 75% of the medical schools. Defined numeric boundaries were used by 47% of schools. Tabulated results showed that within a school the range of excellence varied from as tight as 20 percentile points to so broad that 65% of the students were classified as _excellent._ The boundaries of _excellent_ , among different schools, varied from as low as the third to as high as the ninety-second percentile. In half the schools, students described as _excellent_ might be in the bottom half of their class. A total of 28% of the schools used _excellent_ , but without any numeric definition. No school used _excellent_ to describe its best students.

## Conclusions

Medical student deans often exaggerate the quality of their graduates by using the word _excellent_ at variance with the dictionary definition of exceptionally good. Inaccurate descriptions by deans of their graduating medical students diminish the value of MSPE.

Program directors would like to interview the very best of the graduating medical students applying to their programs. Diagnostic radiology is a competitive residency with far more candidates than can be invited for interviews. Accompanying each application is the dean’s letter, an obvious tool to help in the selection process.

The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in their 2002 publication ( ) offered explicit guidelines for the composition of the dean’s letter, including renaming this document the Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) so as to emphasize its purpose, to provide information regarding how a student performed at the medical school compared with his and her peers. It is the AAMC standard that each MSPE contain a summary section that will include this comparative information and any school specific categories that differentiate among levels of student performance. They also recommend an Appendix D, a graphic representation of the student’s relative performance compared to their classmates.

Medical Schools Using _Excellent_ in their Summary Paragraph


Medical schools surveyed 75 (100%) Medical schools using _excellent_ as a descriptor in their summary paragraph 56/75 (75%) Medical schools using _excellent_ as a descriptor in their summary paragraph with a defined hierarchy of categories (eg, _good, very good, excellent, superior_ , and _outstanding_ ) 40/75 (53%) There are three subcategories for the 40 medical schools using _excellent_ as part of a defined hierarchy:

5/75 (7%) Medical schools using _excellent_ as a descriptor in their summary paragraph, but without a defined hierarchy. 16/75 (21%) Medical schools not using the descriptor _excellent._ 19/75 (25%)

The three schools at the bottom of this chart have defined the upper but not the lower boundary for their descriptor _excellent_ .

Table 3


Idiosyncratic Medical School Variations of the Hierarchy of _Good, Very Good, Excellent, Superior_ , and _Outstanding_

Three schools used _superior_ as their top category with _outstanding_ second best. One school used _superior_ as their top category and eliminated _outstanding._ One school eliminated _superior_ and used instead _superb_ as their top category, with _outstanding_ relegated to second best. One school eliminated _excellent_ , and used instead _exceptional_ as their top category with _outstanding_ second best. One school used _excellent_ as better than _superior_ , but subordinate to _outstanding._ In this case, the range of _excellent_ was 61%–83%, but the range of _superior_ was only from 36%–60%. One school described 65% of their students as _excellent_ , but with the lowest 20% of the class categorized as _very good_ and the top 25% as either _superior_ or _outstanding_ . This adds up to 110%.
