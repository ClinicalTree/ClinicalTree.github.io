## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms on computer-assisted detection (CAD) software for lung nodules in ultra-low-dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) for lung cancer screening.

## Materials and Methods

We selected 85 subjects who underwent both a low-dose CT (LD-CT) scan and an additional ULD-CT scan in our lung cancer screening program for high-risk populations. The LD-CT scans were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP; LD-FBP). The ULD-CT scans were reconstructed with FBP (ULD-FBP), adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D; ULD-AIDR 3D), and forward projected model-based IR solution (FIRST; ULD-FIRST). CAD software for lung nodules was applied to each image dataset, and the performance of the CAD software was compared among the different IR algorithms.

## Results

The mean volume CT dose indexes were 3.02 mGy (LD-CT) and 0.30 mGy (ULD-CT). For overall nodules, the sensitivities of CAD software at 3.0 false positives per case were 78.7% (LD-FBP), 9.3% (ULD-FBP), 69.4% (ULD-AIDR 3D), and 77.8% (ULD-FIRST). Statistical analysis showed that the sensitivities of ULD-AIDR 3D and ULD-FIRST were significantly higher than that of ULD-FBP ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

The performance of CAD software in ULD-CT was improved by using IR algorithms. In particular, the performance of CAD in ULD-FIRST was almost equivalent to that in LD-FBP.

## Introduction

The results from the National Lung Screening Trial showed that lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) compared to chest X-ray screening significantly reduced lung cancer mortality among heavy smokers . Recently, several guidelines have recommended annual LD-CT screening for lung cancer in high-risk populations .

If lung cancer screening using LD-CT is to become routinely available, it is desirable to further reduce the radiation dose. Several techniques have been proposed to reduce the radiation dose , and, recently, iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms have become clinically applicable in decreasing the radiation dose while maintaining diagnostic image quality . There are two types of IR algorithm: hybrid IR and model-based IR. Hybrid IR algorithms involve a combination of IR and filtered back projection (FBP). In contrast, model-based IR algorithms are fully iterative and use models of the acquisition process, image statistics, and system geometry.  Table 1 shows a list of the major commercially available IR algorithms. A number of studies have investigated the detectability of lung nodules in LD-CT or ultra-low-dose CT (ULD-CT) reconstructed with IR algorithms .
