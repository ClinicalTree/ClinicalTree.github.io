## Rationale and Objectives

Basal lung opacities are frequently observed on supine chest x-ray (SCXR) of intensive care patients, causing insecurity among clinicians and radiologists. We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of SCXR for basal pneumonia.

## Materials and Methods

We identified 172 patients who received both SCXR and computed tomography within 1 hour. Two readers examined the SCXR and rated findings in both basal zones according to the following scale: 0 = “no pneumonia,” 1 = “possible pneumonia,” 2 = “highly suspected pneumonia.” Computed tomography served as standard of reference. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) were calculated once pooling 0 and 1 as negative and once pooling 1 and 2 as positive finding.

## Results

When pooling 0 and 1 as negative, sensitivity was 0.45 (right)/0.38 (left), specificity was 0.94/0.97, PPV was 0.76/0.79, and NPV was 0.81/0.84. When pooling 1 and 2 as positive, sensitivity was 0.80/0.75, specificity was 0.62/0.58, PPV was 0.45/0.35, and NPV was 0.88/0.89. The most common findings in false-positive cases were combined pleural effusions and lower lobe atelectasis.

## Conclusions

Interpreting only highly suspicious basal opacities as pneumonia considerably increases the PPV with almost constant NPV. Clinicians and radiologists should be aware of the limitations of SCXR regarding basal pneumonia.

## Introduction

Supine chest x-ray (SCXR) is the most commonly performed examination in modern intensive care medicine despite the technological advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging. Interpreting SCXR examinations still represents a diagnostic challenge. As daily routine use of SCXR provided no benefit regarding patient mortality and safety compared to an on-demand approach , several institutions have banned SCXR as a daily routine examination on intensive care units (ICUs).

Even in these institutions, SCXR remains a frequently performed diagnostic test in patients with suspected pulmonary infections. Importantly, pneumonia still prevails as the leading cause of death in ICU patients. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is a crucial task for intensive care physicians . Clinical and laboratory findings such as respiratory deterioration, raised inflammatory markers, fever, and sputum cultures can be very difficult to interpret in the context of the patients' severe underlying diseases . Thus, imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis of pneumonia.

Diagnostic accuracy values for supine chest x-ray readings of basal pneumonia, with results of CT scans serving as a reference standard. Grades for pneumonia on chest x-ray: 0 = no, 1 = possible, 2 = highly suspected. Diagnostic accuracy values are shown both for rating grades 1 and 2 as positive for pneumonia and for rating only grade 2 as positive. For each categorization, diagnostic accuracy values are presented for the reading results without and with comparison to previous examinations, where available. Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals are given in parentheses.
