## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the improved accuracy of radiologic assessment of lung cancer afforded by computer-aided diagnosis (CADx).

## Materials and Methods

Inclusion/exclusion criteria were formulated, and a systematic inquiry of research databases was conducted. Following title and abstract review, an in-depth review of 149 surviving articles was performed with accepted articles undergoing a Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-based quality review and data abstraction.

## Results

A total of 14 articles, representing 1868 scans, passed the review. Increases in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve of .8 or higher were seen in all nine studies that reported it, except for one that employed subspecialized radiologists.

## Conclusions

This systematic review demonstrated improved accuracy of lung cancer assessment using CADx over manual review, in eight high-quality observer-performance studies. The improved accuracy afforded by radiologic lung-CADx suggests the need to explore its use in screening and regular clinical workflow.

## Introduction

Lung cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States and among the top 10 worldwide. More Americans die each year from lung cancer than from breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers combined. Annually, lung cancer kills more men than prostate cancer and more women than breast cancer .

Whereas overall cancer incidence rates are declining, lung cancer incidence rates among women are rising. Between 1960 and 1990, deaths from lung cancer among women increased over 400%. It is the second most common cancer among African American men and kills more African Americans than any other cancer. Five-year survival ranges from 70% for stage I disease to less than 5% for stage IV disease. As of 2014, overall 5-year survival is 17%, with only 15% diagnosed at the localized stage .
