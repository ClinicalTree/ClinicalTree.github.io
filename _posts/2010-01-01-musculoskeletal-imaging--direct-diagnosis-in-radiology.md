This is 1 of a 12-book series published by Thieme (series title Direct Diagnosis in Radiology). Each book covers 1 of the 12 main subspecialties in radiology. The aim is to produce a well-organized reference text for the most commonly encountered pathology in daily practice. The book is half the size of a standard textbook, likely reflecting its perceived use as a quick reference source.

There are nine chapters: tumors, inflammatory disease, degenerative disease, metabolic disorders, developmental disorders, osteonecrosis, intra-articular lesions, ligament and tendon injuries, and fractures and dislocations. The chapters comprise the “most common” lesions encountered in each category. Individual lesions are detailed with high-yield information related to epidemiology, etiology/pathophysiology, imaging signs and findings from each modality, clinical issues, differential diagnosis with high-yield discriminators, and tips and pitfalls. Selected references are cited for each subject.

The intended audience is primarily medical students and radiology residents, but musculoskeletal radiology fellows, practicing radiologists, emergency room providers, and sports medicine clinicians would also benefit from this textbook.

The text is well organized and easily navigated. There are typically two to four high-quality images included for each lesion. Many illustrations are also included for topics such as fracture patterns or grading schemes, which are also of high quality and instructive for learning purposes.

This is a useful, well-written quick reference text of musculoskeletal imaging. Image quality is superb throughout. This book would be most useful as a quick reference book in the reading room or for medical students rotating in musculoskeletal imaging.
