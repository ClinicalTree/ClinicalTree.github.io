## Rationale and Objectives

Satisfaction of search (SOS) occurs when an abnormality is missed because another abnormality has been detected. This research studied whether the severity of a detected fracture determines whether subsequent fractures are overlooked.

## Materials and Methods

Each of 70 simulated multitrauma patients presented examinations of three anatomic areas. Readers evaluated each patient under two experimental conditions: when the images of the first anatomic area included a fracture (the SOS condition), and when it did not (the control condition). The SOS effect was measured on detection accuracy for subtle test fractures presented on examinations of the second and third anatomic areas. In an experiment with 12 radiology readers, the initial SOS radiographs showed nondisplaced fractures of extremities, fractures associated with low morbidity. In another experiment with 12 different radiology readers, the initial examination, usually a computed tomography scan, showed cervical and pelvic fractures of the type associated with high morbidity. Because of their more direct role in patient care, the experiment using high morbidity SOS fractures was repeated with 17 orthopedic readers.

## Results

Detection of subtle test fractures was substantially reduced when fractures of low morbidity were added ( _P_ < .01). No similar SOS effect was observed in either experiment in which added fractures were associated with high morbidity.

## Conclusions

The satisfaction of search effect in skeletal radiology was replicated, essentially doubling the evidence for SOS in musculoskeletal radiology, and providing an essential contrast to the absence of SOS from high-morbidity fractures.

Physicians have long been aware that an injury may draw and hold their attention, diverting it from other injuries ( ). A “satisfaction of search” (SOS) effect has been demonstrated in which the discovery of a fracture on one image interfered with the detection of a subtle fracture on another image of the same patient ( ). Detection of subtle test fractures was substantially reduced when additional fractures were included in other images of each multitrauma series. The clinical practice of radiology has changed greatly since this experiment was performed in 1994. Whereas the previous experiment used radiographs interpreted at a film viewer, current practice relies heavily on computed tomography and direct digital radiography with interpretation at workstations equipped with high-resolution displays. The first experiment reported here attempts to replicate the SOS effect of finding “minor” added fractures on subsequent test fractures in a patient’s multitrauma series using modern images and displays.

In 2001, gaze time on fractures was measured in an attempt to determine whether test fractures were missed in this SOS effect because of misdirection of attention ( ). Although readers spent somewhat less time inspecting subsequent radiographs of a patient’s trauma series after viewing initial radiographs that contained added fractures, they generally did look at the test fractures that they failed to report. When the experiment was repeated to examine whether the severity of the added fracture affected search, test fractures were missed more often when they appeared with major added fractures than with minor added fractures. Because there were only 10 cases and only one that included no test fracture, true- and false-positive rates could not be estimated with acceptable precision or certainty. We address this question in the second and third experiments using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology, testing whether added fractures with major morbidity yield greater SOS.

Obvious abnormalities with major clinical significance (arrows) include a C6 bilateral facet dislocation (a) with anterior translation of C6 and C7 (b) . The acetabular fracture (arrow) in (c) represents a noticeable, but less significant, abnormality. The navicular fracture (arrow), although the least obvious, is best seen on the lateral view (d) , although the anteroposterior and oblique views were also presented. The navicular fracture serves as a test fracture. Its detection was measured when a fracture of major clinical significance (a,b) was present in the case and when it was not. In a separate experiment, the detection of the test fracture (d) was measured when a more obvious, though non–life-threatening fracture (c) was present in the case and when it was not.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SatisfactionofSearchinMultitraumaPatientsSeverityofDetectedFractures/0_1s20S1076633207001390.jpg)

The test fracture was a right navicular fracture visible on the foot (when shown on a 3-megapixel monitor, a–d ). The chest examination was normal (a–d) . The minor added fracture in experiment 1 was a left acetabular fracture (a) . The corresponding pelvic study for the non-SOS condition was a normal pelvis (b) .
