## Rationale and Objectives

Podcasts and vodcasts (video podcasts) have become popular means of sharing educational information via the Internet.

## Materials and Methods

In this article, we introduce another method, an enhanced podcast, which allows images to be displayed with the audio. Bookmarks and URLs may also be imbedded within the presentation. This article describes a step-by-step tutorial for recording and distributing an enhanced podcast using the Macintosh operating system. Enhanced podcasts can also be created on the Windows platform using other software. An example of an enhanced podcast and a demonstration video of all the steps described in this article are available online at web.mac.com/mthapa.

## Results

An enhanced podcast is an effective method of delivering radiological information via the Internet. Viewing images while simultaneously listening to audio content allows the user to have a richer experience than with a simple podcast. Incorporation of bookmarks and URLs within the presentation will make learning more efficient and interactive.

## Conclusion

The use of still images rather than video clips equates to a much smaller file size for an enhanced podcast compared to a vodcast, allowing quicker upload and download times.

Audio podcasting has been available since October 2003. The term _podcasting_ is a portmanteau of two words: iPod and broadcasting. As a simple definition, podcasting refers to the delivery of subscribable audio content through the Internet. Video podcasting (vodcasting) became practical with the advent of the video iPod in November 2005.

A more comprehensive definition of podcasting is the distribution of audio or video files, such as radio programs or music videos, over the Internet using either Really Simple Syndication (RSS) or Atom syndication for listening or watching on mobile devices and personal computers (not just iPods).
