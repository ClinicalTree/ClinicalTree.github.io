## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of imaging or tracking hepatocellular carcinoma cells by modifying these cells to carry a multimodality reporter gene, enabling fluorescence, bioluminescence, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vitro and in vivo.

## Materials and Methods

HepG2 cells were labeled with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/luciferase2/ferritin—the multimodality reporter gene (labeled HepG2 cells). The labeled and unlabeled HepG2 cells were cultured in vitro and then injected subcutaneously into mice as a hepatoma model in vivo. The expressions of EGFP, luciferase2, and ferritin in HepG2 cell suspensions and hepatoma model were investigated using fluorescence, bioluminescence, and MRI.

## Results

Individual HepG2 cells expressing EGFP were identified under blue laser excitation. The linear coefficient between the optical signal intensity of luciferase2 and the number of labeled cells was 0.993. MRI was used to distinguish the T2\* signal of 2 × 10  7 cells/mL between the labeled (6.67 ± 1.88 ms) and unlabeled cells (10.66 ± 2.22 ms) ( _P_ = 0.034). In vivo, individual HepG2 cells expressing EGFP in frozen sections were observed. Labeled cells expressing luciferase2 have been detected since the second day after injection, and the bioluminescence increased with the tumor size. The T2\* signal was significantly different between the labeled (6.04 ± 1.60 ms) and unlabeled cells (17.06 ± 2.17 ms) ( _P_ <  0.001).

## Conclusions

A multimodality reporter gene consisting of EGFP, luciferase2, and ferritin was successfully integrated into the HepG2 cell genome via a lentiviral vector and was highly expressed in the daughter cells. These cells could be detected by fluorescence, bioluminescence, and MRI in vitro and in vivo.

## Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common forms of cancer and is the fifth most prevalent cause of tumor-related death globally . The absolute number of new HCC cases continues to increase, and HCC is projected to remain as the largest cancer burden for the next several decades. Although advancements in gene diagnosis and treatment modalities have helped improve the survival and prognosis of HCC patients, HCC diagnosis predominantly depends on imaging studies such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), limiting the early diagnosis of the disease . Several biomarkers have been proposed , but no available theory can explain how these malignant cells are capable of evading immune clearance or when and where they prefer to reside and metastasize. This limited knowledge has hindered our understanding of the pathologic changes caused by HCC and our identification of potential therapeutic targets. Thus, tracing or imaging HCC cells in vitro and in vivo at the molecular level is a challenge for the treatment of HCC.

Gene imaging , which is a distinct imaging from exogenous tracers, can be visualized stably in cells, enabling the precise localization of labeled cells. Both optical imaging and MRI facilitate the noninvasive tracking of transplanted cells in living organisms. Due to its advantages in terms of sensitivity and specificity, bioluminescent reporters are among the most widely used, as they can provide qualitative and quantitative information about the cells . However, due to photo attenuation and light scattering within deep tissues, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) lacks tomographic resolution and limits its application to small animals or superficial areas . Ferritin has been used as a T2\*-weighted MRI probe to dynamically track cells in vivo because of the low-intensity signals generated from T2\*-weighted MRI . In contrast to optical imaging, MRI displays the advantages of unlimited depth penetration, high spatial resolution, and multiple imaging parameters; however, MRI cannot distinguish whether or not the transplanted cells are surviving . Apparently, the combination of these two imaging tools may overcome their disadvantages while benefiting from each of their advantages to provide improved cell tracking in vivo . Moreover, because the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) can be detected in single cells, the sensitivity of EGFP enables its function as a sorting and qualitative marker for cell tracing. Therefore, the expression of reporter genes that can be used for several imaging modalities in targeted cells would have complementary advantages in sensitivity and specificity and would provide a complete and precise description of the biological processes in these cells.
