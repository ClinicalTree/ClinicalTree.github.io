## Rationale and Objectives

Previous cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that airway wall thickness and air trapping are greater in subjects with severe asthma than in those with mild-to-moderate asthma. However, a better understanding of how airway remodeling and lung density change over time is needed. This study aimed to evaluate predictors of airway wall remodeling and change in lung function and lung density over time in severe asthma.

## Materials and methods

Phenotypic characterization and quantitative multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) of the chest were performed at baseline and ∼2.6 years later in 38 participants with asthma (severe _n_ = 24 and mild-to-moderate _n_ = 14) and nine normal controls from the Severe Asthma Research Program.

## Results

Subjects with severe asthma had a significant decline in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent (FEV  1 %) predicted over time ( _P_ < .001). Airway wall thickness measured by MDCT was increased at multiple airway generations in severe asthma compared to mild-to-moderate asthma (wall area percent \[WA%\]: _P_ < .05) and normals ( _P_ < .05) at baseline and year 2. Over time, there was an increase in WA% and wall thickness percent (WT%) in all subjects ( _P_ = .030 and .009, respectively) with no change in emphysema-like lung or air trapping. Baseline prebronchodilator FEV  1 % inversely correlated with WA% and WT% (both _P_ < .05). In a multivariable regression model, baseline WA%, race, and health care utilization were predictors of subsequent airway remodeling.

## Conclusions

Severe asthma subjects have a greater decline in lung function over time than normal subjects or those with mild-to-moderate asthma. MDCT provides a noninvasive measure of airway wall thickness that may predict subsequent airway remodeling.

Over 25 million people in the United States are afflicted with asthma . The increased rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) in subjects with asthma compared to normal subjects has been reported to be 5–25 mL/year . Most of the longitudinal studies to date have focused primarily on decline in lung function in asthma and response to treatment . When compared to controls, airway walls are thicker in older but not in younger subjects with fatal asthma, suggesting that airway remodeling is a progressive process over time . Airway remodeling defined by histologic airway wall thickening has been associated with airway hyperreactivity and airflow obstruction .

In cross-sectional studies, increased airway wall area (WA) and wall thickness (WT) measured by computed tomography (CT) correlate with asthma severity and negatively correlate with FEV  1 . Airway WA measured by CT also correlates with histologic airway wall thickening on endobronchial airway biopsies . Studies focusing on the progression of the airway remodeling in asthma radiographically and pathologically over time have been limited.
