_Breast Imaging_ is a single volume in the Dx-Direct series from Thieme. This book is a concise, pocket-sized manual, which encompasses and reviews both benign and malignant processes within the breast.

The book describes the epidemiology and imaging features of both benign and malignant entities. The images are excellent representations of the disease processes and all the modalities are adequately represented. Specifically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and findings are detailed in a clear distinct fashion.

Imaging signs of for each modality are described for the pathology in a logical progression, including MRI. The differential diagnosis is also presented with the imaging signs and highlighted with tips, as well as a description of common pitfalls and errors.

The description and presentation of Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System is abbreviated, but details the salient features concisely. There is sparse information on the physics of breast imaging, including digital mammography. However, the overall description of the technical aspects of mammography, ultrasound, and MRI are clear and easy to follow.

The text does describe features of treatment options, especially for low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, which are more characteristic of European management of the disease. However, there is an adequate discussion on the course and prognosis of all benign and malignant pathology.

The text is an adequate, quick reference guide for a radiologist in practice or medical students, but it does not replace a standard textbook. Breast imaging fellows may find that the manual lacks the detailed discussion in evaluation of clinical and imaging findings. The text could also be useful to radiology residents as an adjunct resource for board review.
