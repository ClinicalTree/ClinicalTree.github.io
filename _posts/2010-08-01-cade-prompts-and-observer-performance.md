In computed tomographic (CT) colonography, also known as virtual colonoscopy, patients are typically scanned in two positions . By comparing the two CT scans, radiologists can maximize the visible region of colon for polyp detection and also identify mobile residual materials or normal anatomy that could imitate abnormalities in a single scan. However, current computer-aided detection (CADe) systems consider each scan as a separate study; therefore, the locations of CADe prompts do not necessarily match between the two position scans of the same patient. Thus, radiologists are expected to review all regions indicated by CADe prompts alike, regardless of whether the region was prompted on both scans or on only one.

This month's issue of _Academic Radiology_ contains a research study that investigated the effect of “dual-matching” true-positive CADe prompts on the polyp identification performance of a computer-assisted reader in CT colonography . Four radiologists reviewed simulated CADe prompts of 33 CT colonography studies, 21 of which contained one medium-sized (6–9 mm) adenomatous polyp. Medium-sized polyps are of interest because unaided radiologists tend to miss them more often than larger lesions . Each patient had eight CADe prompts: four in supine and four in prone CT scans. A polyp was indicated either by one true-positive CADe prompt on either CT scan or by a true-positive CADe prompt on both CT scans. According to the results, the use of the matching true-positive CADe prompts yielded a statistically significant 11% increment in the detection sensitivity of computer-assisted readers.

The effect of CADe prompts on observer performance has been studied in medical imaging for more than two decades. A majority of these studies has involved mammography, which is one of the earliest applications of CADe . As with CT colonography, mammography studies have multiple projection images per patient. Retrospective and prospective studies have indicated that the use of CADe prompts can increase breast cancer detection rate , but it has also been observed that CADe systems have low specificity, their sensitivity is relatively poor for subtle lesions, and that CADe prompts do not serve as a decision-making aid . Similar observations have been made with CADe for CT colonography . To date, the single most common complaint of radiologists has been that current CADe systems display too many false positives. Studies and user comments suggest that false-positive CADe prompts increase interpretation time, confuse readers, and that routine observation of a large number of redundant CADe prompts on obviously normal regions can make the reader lose confidence on the ability of the CADe system to be of real help .

It is also well-known that radiologists can dismiss true lesions even if they are indicated correctly by CADe prompts. An often overlooked issue is that even if radiologists can see a lesion, they can still have difficulty in interpreting the image correctly and making the right decision about the case . A recent CADe study in CT colonography indicated that, even though computer-assisted readers reported more of the medium-sized polyps than did unaided readers, the likelihood that a computer-assisted reader incorrectly dismissed a lesion that was indicated correctly by a CADe prompt increased with increasing lesion size and, in particular, with non-polypoid appearance of the lesion .

Obviously, if a reader lacks the training and experience to identify true lesions even if they are pointed out to that reader or if the prompted lesions are not considered “actionable,” CADe prompts alone will be of limited help in improving detection sensitivity. The reader could also dismiss CADe prompts too eagerly because of a conscious or subconscious bias about the CADe system. Such a bias could be caused by a variety of reasons, such as routine display of large numbers of false-positive CADe prompts or expectations that CADe is only useful for indicating certain types of lesions. The reader could also be confused by clinical studies that often generalize their observations made on a specific version of a specific CADe system to apply to all CADe systems, even though another CADe system that uses different detection algorithms could have quite different performance profile with the same or different data .

The conventional approach to improve reader confidence on CADe has been to develop methods for reducing false-positive CADe prompts and for improving detection sensitivity for subtle lesions. However, effective communication between CADe systems and radiologists is becoming increasingly important. To help radiologists make better decisions, CADe systems may need to provide additional information, such as the estimated likelihood that a CADe prompt represents a true lesion; for example, in terms of the size or color of CADe prompts. This would also reduce the gap to computer-assisted diagnosis, in which the goal is to aid radiologists in the diagnosis of already detected lesions but that to date has been kept largely separate from CADe .
