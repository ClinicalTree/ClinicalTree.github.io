## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis for evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of 1.5 Tesla and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA), in the detection of scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) injury.

## Materials and Methods

A literature search was performed (until July 2015) using the PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and conference proceedings. Original studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of MRI or MRA in the detection of SLIL injuries using arthroscopy or open surgery as the reference standard were included.

## Results

Of the initial 930 published records and 103 conference proceedings, 24 studies (1902 MRI examinations) were included (median SLIL injury prevalence: 33% \[interquartile range: 25–42\]). Heterogeneity was detected for 1.5 T MRI (chi-square: 47.93, _P_ < 0.001) but not for 3.0 T MRI (chi-square: 8.00, _P_ value: 0.09) and MRA (chi-square: 14.54, _P_ value: 0.34) studies. The sensitivities of 1.5 T MRI, 3.0 T MRI, and MRA for detection of SLIL injury were 45.7% (95% confidence interval: 40.1–51.4), 75.7% (66.8–83.2), and 82.1% (76.1–87.2), respectively. The specificities of 1.5 T MRI, 3.0 T MRI, and MRA for detection of SLIL injury were 80.5% (77.3–83.4), 97.1% (89.8–99.6), and 92.8% (90.2–94.9), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratios of 1.5 T MRI, 3.0 T MRI, and MRA for detection of SLIL injury were 5.56 (2.71–11.39), 23.23 (3.16–171.00), and 65.04 (32.89–128.62) ( _P_ value < 0.001), respectively. The results were consistent after addressing publication bias and sensitivity analyses.

## Conclusions

MRA is superior to 3.0 T MRI, and 3.0 T MRI is superior to 1.5 T MRI in terms of diagnostic performance. 3.0 T MRI has the highest specificity for the detection of SLIL injuries.

## Introduction

The scapholunate interosseous ligament (SLIL) is a small, intrinsic structure with an essential role in the stability of the proximal carpal row . The SLIL is a frequently injured interosseous ligament, and SLIL tear is the most common cause of chronic wrist ligamentous instability . Compromised function, chronic wrist pain, and ultimately secondary osteoarthritis are some of the most important complications of SLIL injury .

In some patients, diagnosis of wrist instability can be made using clinical examination and plain radiographs . However, noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or minimally invasive magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) plays a major role in the detection of specific intrinsic ligaments' injuries and decision-making for surgical management .
