## Rationale and Objectives

Dynamic flow ultrasound (DFUS) is a new color Doppler imaging method with better B-mode imaging and fewer blooming effects and color noises. This study was designed to compare the imaging quality of vessel signals in thoracic lesions using DFUS, color Doppler US (CDUS), and power Doppler US (PDUS).

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-four patients with thoracic lesions abutting pulsatile organs \[heart ( _n_ = 13), aorta ( _n_ = 14) and pulmonary artery ( _n_ = 7)\] and undergoing complete chest US examinations were included to assess the imaging quality about vessel signals, blooming effect, color noise, and the influence of decision in needle biopsy between different US modes.

## Results

Our results showed that DFUS, CDUS, and PDUS could all demonstrate the vessel signals clearly (all _P_ \> .05). However, when focusing on the blooming effect and color noise, DFUS showed the more superior imaging quality than CDUS and PDUS (all _P_ ≤ .001); and acceptable blooming effects/color noise were found with 100% (34/34)/97% (33/34), 35% (12/34)/68% (23/34), and 26% (9/34)/38% (13/34) in DFUS, CDUS, and PDUS, respectively. Especially, in the assessment of decision making for percutaneous needle biopsy, DFUS had the less influence than CDUS and PDUS (3% \[1/33\] versus 29% \[10/34\] and 3% \[1/33\] versus 38% \[13/34\], both _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

We concluded that DFUS has a clearly more superior imaging quality than CDUS and PDUS in demonstrating the vessel signals of thoracic lesions, with less blooming effect and color noise.

Chest ultrasound (US) examination and US-guided needle biopsy have been widely used to assess and diagnose thoracic lesions abutting the chest wall with promising results, even in critically ill patients ( ). However, the use of conventional gray-scale US only is often limited in the assessment of vessel signals in thoracic lesions because US-guided needle biopsy for pulmonary lesions is somewhat risky, especially the biopsy of uncommon and unknown mediastinal tumors and pulmonary consolidations ( ). Thus the real-time visualization of vessel signals during the performance of US-guided needle biopsy becomes more important, useful, and valuable ( ).

For the evaluation of vessel signals in normal tissues, organs, and pathologic lesions, color Doppler US (CDUS) and Power Doppler US (PDUS) have been used to assess vessel signals, including those of the cardiovascular system, abdominal lesions, obstetric and gynecologic lesions, breast lesions, carotid and intracranial vessels, and pulmonary lesions ( ). Nevertheless, CDUS and PDUS can easily produce blooming effects of vessels and color noises in demonstrating the lesions abutting pulsatile organs ( ). The blooming effects of vessels render the US assessment of vessel signals not so real, and color noises lower confidence in the US demonstration of vessel signals.
