## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the reproducibility of volume computed tomographic perfusion (VPCT) measurements in normal pancreatic tissue using two different kinetic perfusion calculation models at three different time points.

## Materials and methods

Institutional ethical board approval was obtained for retrospective analysis of pancreas perfusion data sets generated by our prospective study for liver response monitoring to local therapy in patients experiencing unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, which was approved by the institutional review board. VPCT of the entire pancreas was performed in 41 patients (mean age, 64.8 years) using 26 consecutive volume measurements and intravenous injection of 50 mL of iodinated contrast at a flow rate of 5 mL/s. Blood volume(BV) and blood flow (BF) were calculated using two mathematical methods: maximum slope + Patlak analysis versus deconvolution method. Pancreas perfusion was calculated using two volume of interests. Median interval between the first and the second VPCT was 2 days and between the second and the third VPCT 82 days. Variability was assessed with within-patient coefficients of variation (CVs) and Bland–Altman analyses. Interobserver agreement for all perfusion parameters was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).

## Results

BF and BV values varied widely by method of analysis as did within-patient CVs for BF and BV at the second versus the first VPCT by 22.4%/50.4% (method 1) and 24.6%/24.0% (method 2) measured in the pancreatic head and 18.4%/62.6% (method 1) and 23.8%/28.1% (method 2) measured in the pancreatic corpus and at the third versus the first VPCT by 21.7%/61.8% (method 1) and 25.7%/34.5% (method 2) measured also in the pancreatic head and 19.1%/66.1% (method 1) and 22.0%/31.8% (method 2) measured in the pancreatic corpus, respectively. Interobserver agreement measured with ICC shows fair-to-good reproducibility.

## Conclusions

VPCT performed with the presented examinational protocol is reproducible and can be used for monitoring purposes. Best reproducibility was obtained with both methods for BF and with method 2 also for BV data for both follow-up studies.

Volume perfusion computed tomography (VPCT) is an imaging technique enabling the acquisition of functional perfusion-based data complementary to classical morphologic CT diagnostics . Some authors have demonstrated that perfusion measurements can be easily integrated in a normal whole-body CT examinational protocol meant to acquire information about the course of oncologic and inflammatory diseases . For the purpose of performing perfusion-based monitoring of all these disorders, reproducibility of functional parameters is imperative. Some previous reports have dealt with this issue presenting in part contradictory data and emphasizing the role of using standardized examination protocols . Moreover, the calculation kinetic models (compartmental vs. deconvolution) for perfusion quantification differ, and their strengths and limitations have been already reported . These models quantify perfusion parameters and allow pixel-by-pixel calculation of a range of physiological parameters (blood flow \[BF\], blood volume \[BV\], mean transit time \[MTT\], time to peak, and k-trans or flow extraction product, defined as the sum of flow within the microvasculature and capillary permeability) and depiction as parametric maps. The pancreas is a common site for primary and secondary tumors and for inflammatory diseases, therefore, an important anatomic site in which to evaluate appropriate imaging techniques. In addition, the pancreas represents a less mobile organ that allows optimized motion correction and is lying adjacent to the aorta, which is preferentially used, as the arterial input vessel. Our objectives were to assess the variability of perfusion CT measurements in the normal pancreas tissue measured twice by repeat VPCT within 48 hours and once again 3 months later to evaluate the robustness of results delivered by two different kinetic perfusion models.

## Materials and methods

## Patients and Target Lesions

Our prospective study for liver response monitoring to local therapy in patients experiencing unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was approved by the institutional review board, written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study complied with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. Liver measurements included also the pancreas, so we retrospectively analyzed pancreas perfusion in terms of data reproducibility. Institutional ethical board approval for retrospective analysis of pancreas perfusion was obtained separately for all patients. Inclusion criteria were perfusion of the hole pancreas, normal pancreas function based on the evaluation of amylase and lipase, normal CT morphology, and exclusion of chronic or acute pancreatitis based on laboratory analysis, clinical examination, and CT examination. Exclusion criteria were known chronic or acute pancreatitis, alcohol abuse, elevated amylase and lipase, and morphologic disorders of the pancreas like tumor, fatty, or fibrotic degeneration of the pancreas. Furthermore, patients were excluded from evaluation if the pancreas shows any morphologic disorders or if amylase and lipase showed an increase after transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE). A total of 41 patients (36 men and 5 women; mean age, 64.8 years; range, 37–78 years, respectively) from a cohort of 51 patients were eligible for retrospective perfusion data analysis.
