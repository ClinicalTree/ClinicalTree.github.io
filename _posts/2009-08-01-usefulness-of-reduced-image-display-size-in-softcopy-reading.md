## Rationale and Objectives

The purposes of the present study were to investigate the impact of viewing size on soft-copy diagnosis for detecting abnormalities on digital chest radiographs and to verify the usefulness of reduced digital chest radiography.

## Materials and Methods

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and localized ROC (LROC) analysis of clinical images was performed using the standard digital image database of the Japanese Radiation Technology Society. A total of 30 images with and 20 images without nodule samples were extracted randomly from the database and used for ROC analysis. A total of 100 images were prepared for observation of reduced and nonreduced images. Observers' viewing images were adjusted as nonreduced size (large, 30 × 30 cm) and reduced size (small, 15 × 15 cm).

## Results

The estimated mean areas under the LROC curves were 0.665 ± 0.071 for large-size images and 0.669 ± 0.087 for small-size images. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the two groups ( _P_ = .823). The viewing time of small-size images (1201.4 seconds) was significantly shorter than that of large-size images (1719.7 seconds). A statistically significant difference was also found in viewing times between reduced and nonreduced digital images with Wilcoxon's signed-rank test ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

This study provided important information that there was a statistically significant difference in viewing times between reduced and nonreduced digital chest radiographic images, whereas no significant difference was found in areas under the LROC curves for the accuracy of diagnosis between the two groups. However, the double-check method for chest x-ray screening would be done efficiently by changing the viewing size to improve the specificity of diagnosis.

Digital image acquisition and display technologies are undergoing rapid development as a replacement for hard-copy interpretation. Although image diagnosis with a radiograph viewed on a standard light box is still popular, viewing radiologic images from monitors has become common practice in medicine. In Japan, radiography and photofluorography have both been selectively used depending on the purpose of the imaging. Photofluorography has in the past provided an economical means for mass chest radiography and has been used extensively for tuberculosis surveys in Japan. However, this is not a common technique today because of recent digital innovation in radiology. On chest x-ray examination, photofluorography was first performed, and if necessary, radiography was then recommended as a follow-up. Although it is seldom used now, in our experience, reduced-size photofluorography was better for diagnostic accuracy for lung nodules than radiography. A few reports are available on observer performance of viewing size with hard copy to support the merits of reduced images . Nakano reported that the diagnostic accuracy of photofluorography was often better than that of radiography. Kobayashi et al reported that the detectability of these two methods was similar and that its degree depended largely on human visual system sensitivity or the films' characteristics. On the other hand, Tanaka et al reported that radiologists often failed to identify lesions during chest photofluorography, because with this mode of imaging, the influence of reduced image size and the direction of viewing varied.

The diagnosis of chest diseases is often difficult for radiologists because lung lesions tend to be located over low-contrast structures, such as ribs and other bones, the diaphragm, or the mediastinum. Furthermore, false-positive diagnoses may occur. The chest x-ray has limitations; therefore, overall diagnostic tests (eg, computed tomography, positron emission tomography) should be performed to diagnose, for example, lung disease. Many manufacturers offer different viewing software for soft-copy reading in digital radiography. Almost all viewing software includes zoom tools for users to magnify and reduce the view of images, thereby facilitating easy viewing. Our previous phantom study showed that there was no significant difference between reduced and non-reduced image size, but there was a significant difference in the viewing time . If there is no significant difference in observer performance between reduced and nonreduced digital images, such as photofluorography and radiography, radiologists can diagnose quickly and decrease total viewing time using reduced digital images. The shortening of overall diagnostic viewing time also brings benefits of economy. The purposes of the present study were to investigate the impact of viewing size on soft-copy reading for detecting abnormalities on digital chest radiographs and to verify the usefulness of reduced digital chest radiography.
