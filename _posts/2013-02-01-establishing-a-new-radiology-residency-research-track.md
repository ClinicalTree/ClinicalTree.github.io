The authors describe the establishment of a radiology residency research track at their institution. Based on growing biomedical technology needs and the tremendous increase in imaging-based research, the importance of training and cultivating future clinical investigators continues to grow. Within the framework of a supportive environment, a residency research track exposes motivated radiologists-in-training to the tools, challenges, and successes of a career in academics. The authors describe their program's design, admissions process, curriculum, and expectations. Lastly, the authors share the insight of their experience and seek feedback from readers who have been involved in similar endeavors.

## Introduction

In 1999, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) launched its new research initiative, entitled Revitalizing the Radiology Research Enterprise (RRRE) . The RRRE helped to refocus the research mission within academic radiology by educating leaders on how to develop, to grow, and to sustain research programs in departments of radiology. In 2000 the creation of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) further articulated this growing and ever evolving relationship between radiology and research. Among its initial five major strategic goals, the NIBIB strove to cultivate the careers of interdisciplinary clinical investigators interested in grant-funded and hypothesis-driven research involving imaging technologies. With the inception of the NIBIB, imaging and radiologic science secured an important position within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) . Between 1996 and 2003, NIH funding to academic radiology departments increased from $105 million to $276 million . With the help of these initiatives, imaging research received a hallmark stimulus.

In 2000, the American Board of Radiology (ABR) addressed the shortage of young physician investigators in diagnostic radiology by creating the “ABR Holman Research Pathway,” named in honor of B. Leonard Holman, MD, former chair of radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. The Holman Pathway was designed to promote the academic careers of young aspiring trainees who possessed strong clinical abilities along with an interest and enthusiasm for research.

In our ever-growing and interconnected world, academic radiology relies on physician scientists to maintain our preeminent expertise in imaging. As imaging continues to increase in popularity and application, there are a growing number of medical disciplines venturing into imaging research. This enriches the field yet accentuates the need for sustaining radiology-trained expertise. To maintain a central role in imaging research, radiology requires an infusion of highly motivated clinician-investigators. No greater resource exists to mold young clinician-investigators than the radiology training programs with their legion of trainees eager to contribute. Such young and enthusiastic individuals hold the greatest promise to push the envelope of innovation and to foster the development of burgeoning and promising new fields such as molecular imaging , nanotechnology , contrast-enhanced ultrasound , and dynamic magnetic resonance imaging to name just a few. With these thoughts in mind, we recall Dr. Dunnick's 2002 remarks to the Intersociety Commission Meeting, “Today's research is tomorrow's practice” .

## Guiding philosophy and goals

To ensure the success of young physician scientists, we need to invest ourselves in their education and training. A radiology research track provides a structured environment to foster the necessary skills to perform translational research and to prepare for an academic career. The research training plan should be individually modifiable to adjust for differing research backgrounds among candidates. Thus, a research track must have three operating goals: 1) to provide uncompromised training in diagnostic radiology, 2) to offer a structured opportunity to excel in clinical and/or basic imaging science research, and 3) to develop skills that will enhance the likelihood of a successful career in academic radiology that includes research.

Ultimately, the success of any research program hinges on its ability to retain its trainees within academic medicine. This objective requires trainees to develop a research project that can serve as the foundation for their future scholarly focus and support the development and refinement of critical translational research skills. With such groundwork in place, these individuals can more successfully compete for federal funding and academic research resources such as laboratory space, protected academic time, and “start-up” packages.
