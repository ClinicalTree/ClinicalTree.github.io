## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of measurements of lung volumes reconstructed using three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) imaging from thin-section multidetector-row CT images compared to standard pulmonary function testing.

## Materials and Methods

Preoperative three-dimensional CT images and pulmonary function test results of 64 patients with solitary pulmonary nodules who were considered candidates for lung resection were reviewed. On the three-dimensional CT images, total lung capacity (TLC  CTV ), emphysematous lung capacity (ELC  CTV ), and normal lung capacity (NLC  CTV ) were calculated. Total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 second were measured using spirometry.

## Results

There was a strong positive correlation between estimated TLC  CTV and measured TLC values ( _r_ = 0.87, _P_ < .001). Estimated ELC  CTV at the threshold value of −900 Hounsfield units was negatively correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( _r_ = −0.56, _P_ < .001). NLC  CTV values were more strongly correlated with vital capacity values than TLC  CTV values ( _r_ = 0.74, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Lung volume calculated using three-dimensional CT volumetry was well correlated with lung volume measured using spirometry. Three-dimensional CT volumetry can be used to evaluate pulmonary function.

The incidence and mortality rate of lung cancer have been increasing worldwide. The prognosis is poor, and the most effective treatment is surgical resection, especially for early-stage non–small-cell lung cancer. However, patients with lung cancer often have other respiratory complications, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to smoking, that increase the risks of surgery . Therefore, it is essential to evaluate preoperative respiratory function and to predict postoperative function to exclude patients who will not be able to safely undergo lobectomy or pneumonectomy.

Preoperative pulmonary function has usually been evaluated using spirometry, although several alternative approaches to evaluating pulmonary function using quantitative computed tomographic (CT) imaging have been reported recently . Ueda et al reported that using quantitative CT imaging at a slice thickness of 10 mm in combination with spirometry improved risk prediction in patients undergoing lung lobectomy for cancer. With the recent advances in multidetector-row CT (MDCT) technology, thinner volumetric data can easily be acquired more quickly and used for the evaluation of three-dimensional lung volumes.
