## Rationale and Objectives

Subpleural fat can be difficult to distinguish from localized pleural thickening (LPT), a marker of asbestos exposure, on chest radiographs. The aims of this study were to examine the influence of body mass index (BMI) on the performance of radiograph readers when classifying LPT and to model the risk of false test results with varying BMI.

## Materials and Methods

Subjects ( _n_ = 200) were patients being screened or treated for asbestos-related health outcomes. A film chest radiograph, a digital chest radiograph, and a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest scan were collected from each subject. All radiographs were independently read by seven B readers and scored using the International Labour Office system. HRCT scans, read by three experienced thoracic radiologists, served as the gold standard for the presence of LPT. We calculated measures of radiograph reader performance, including sensitivity and specificity, for each image modality. We also used logistic regression to estimate the probability of a false-positive and a false-negative result while controlling for covariates.

## Results

The proportion of false-positive readings correlated with BMI. While controlling for covariates, regression modeling showed the probability of a false-positive result increased with increasing BMI category, younger age, not having pleural calcification, and among subjects not reporting occupational or household contact asbestos exposure.

## Conclusions

Clinicians should be cautious when evaluating radiographs of younger obese persons for the presence of asbestos-related pleural plaque, particularly in populations having an anticipated low or background prevalence of LPT.

Localized pleural thickening (LPT) is the most common health outcome associated with inhalation exposure to asbestos . The chest radiograph is the most frequently used modality to screen for asbestos-associated abnormalities, including LPT. However, it can be difficult to distinguish LPT from subpleural fat on chest radiographs and increased body mass index (BMI) has been associated with apparent pleural thickening .

Libby, Montana, was the site of a vermiculite mining and processing operation throughout much of the 20th century. Although vermiculite from other sources has not been linked to adverse health effects, Libby vermiculite contained elongate mineral particles comprising a mixture of asbestiform amphiboles, including winchite, richterite, and tremolite asbestos . In addition to occupational asbestos exposures at the Libby vermiculite operation, exposures also occurred among household contacts of those workers, and numerous exposure pathways existed for other residents of Libby . Consistent with pervasive asbestos exposures, radiographic surveys have found pleural abnormalities among these vermiculite workers and their families and among other Libby residents .

\*Predictive values are dependent on disease prevalence , which can be varied to illustrate the impact of prevalence. The prevalences of LPT on HRCT by BMI category as shown in  Table 1  were used to calculate PPVs and NPVs shown in  Table 2  . To examine the impact of a theoretical prevalence, one could calculate predictive values using these equations: PPV = (Sensitivity\*Prevalence)/(Sensitivity\*Prevalence+\[1−Specificity\]\*\[1−Prevalence\]) or NPV = Specificity\*(1−Prevalence)/(Specificity\*\[1−Prevalence\]+\[1−Sensitivity\]\*Prevalence).
