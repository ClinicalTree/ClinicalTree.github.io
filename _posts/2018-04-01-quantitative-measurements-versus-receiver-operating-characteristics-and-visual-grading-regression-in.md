## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of quantitative measurements with visual grading regression (VGR) and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis in computed tomography (CT) images reconstructed with iterative reconstruction.

## Materials and Methods

CT scans on a liver phantom were performed on CT scanners from GE, Philips, and Toshiba at three dose levels. Images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and hybrid iterative techniques (ASiR, iDose, and AIDR 3D of different strengths). Images were visually assessed by five readers using a four- and five-grade ordinal scale for liver low contrast lesions and for 10 image quality criteria. The results were analyzed with ROC and VGR. Standard deviation, signal-to-noise ratios, and contrast-to-noise ratios were measured in the images.

## Results

All data were compared to FBP. The results of the quantitative measurements were improved for all algorithms. ROC analysis showed improved lesion detection with ASiR and AIDR and decreased lesion detection with iDose. VGR found improved noise properties for all algorithms, increased sharpness with iDose and AIDR, and decreased artifacts from the spine with AIDR, whereas iDose increased the artifacts from the spine. The contrast in the spine decreased with ASiR and iDose.

## Conclusions

Improved quantitative measurements in images reconstructed with iterative reconstruction compared to FBP are not equivalent to improved diagnostic image accuracy.

## Introduction

Iterative reconstruction algorithms decrease image noise in computed tomography (CT) images compared to filtered back projection (FBP) . In FBP, the image noise is inversely proportional to the square of the radiation dose, but with iterative reconstruction, this relationship is changed. Some iterative algorithms change the image texture, which is shown by the different shape of the noise power spectrum . The shape of the noise power spectrum can be dose-dependent , and thereby influence the relationship between noise and low contrast resolution. Studies have shown that regardless of vendors' claims of dose reduction because of use of iterative reconstruction, low contrast resolution does not benefit from the same improvement as noise .

In addition to noise, spatial resolution may influence the visibility of small low-contrast objects. Some iterative reconstruction algorithms improve spatial resolution , but there are also studies that show that the spatial resolution can be degraded . Iterative reconstruction can reduce artifacts such as metal artifacts, beam hardening artifacts, and scattering artifacts ; however, they can also introduce phenomena perceived by viewers as artifacts, like an artificial or blotchy appearance .
