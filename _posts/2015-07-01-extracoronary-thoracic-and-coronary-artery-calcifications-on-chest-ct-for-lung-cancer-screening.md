## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the correlation between prevalence and degree of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and extracoronary calcifications (ECCs), scored quantitatively according to Agatston and semiquantitatively by visual analysis, in chest computed tomography (CT) studies obtained for lung cancer screening in asymptomatic subjects and in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD), and to compare the association of ECC and CAC to established cardiovascular risk factors.

## Materials and Methods

Prospective study on 501 males (67 ± 8 years) with a history of working dust exposure who underwent nongated low-dose chest CT for lung cancer screening. Of these, 63 (12.6%) had a history of CHD, the remaining 438 subjects (87.4%) were clinically asymptomatic and without a history of CHD. On the day of the CT study, subjects underwent a thorough clinical examination including blood tests and completed a standardized questionnaire to establish a complete medical history. ECC and CAC scores were quantified according to Agatston and, in addition, by visual rating of calcium load of individual vessel territories on a five-point scale from “absent” to “extensive.” Results were correlated with the respective subjects' cardiovascular risk factors and with the presence or absence of CHD.

## Results

ECC scores correlated significantly with CAC scores (two-sided Spearman 0.515; _P_ < .001). ECC scores were associated significantly ( _P_ < .001) with cardiovascular risk factors (smoking history, hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia) and with subjects' Framingham/prospective cardiovascular münster study scores, whereas CAC scores were associated only with the presence of hypercholesterolemia. CAC scores were strongly associated with CHD than ECC scores (area under the curve, 0.88 vs. 0.66 at receiver operating characteristic analysis). Visual scoring of ECC/CAC load correlated closely with the respective Agatston values ( _P_ < .001) and revealed the same association (or lack thereof) with cardiovascular risk factors/CHD.

## Conclusions

In nongated low-dose CT for lung cancer screening, CAC and ECC load can be accurately established by visual analysis. ECC and CAC scores correlate closely, but not perfectly. There is a strong association between established cardiovascular risk factors and ECC load, but not CAC load, providing further evidence that ECC scoring may complement CAC scoring for broader risk assessment, for example, regarding prediction of extracoronary vascular events.

It is well established that coronary artery calcifications (CACs) as detected by multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can be used to predict coronary heart disease (CHD) and future coronary events . Over the past decade, there has been accumulating evidence that extracoronary thoracic calcifications such as calcifications of the aortic valve , thoracic aorta, and mitral valve/annulus also seem to correlate with coronary calcified plaque burden , CHD , all-cause, and cardiovascular mortality .

Notwithstanding the observed correlation between coronary and extracoronary calcification (ECC), there is initial evidence that the predictive implications of calcifications for the different vascular territories do vary. ECCs, specifically aortic valve calcifications, have been shown to be a more powerful predictor of extracardiac vascular events such as ischemic stroke . It has also been shown that thoracic aortic calcifications are a significant predictor of future coronary events in women, independent of the degree of coronary calcifications .
