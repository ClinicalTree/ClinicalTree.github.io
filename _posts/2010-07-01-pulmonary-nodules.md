## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the performance of custom-made software designed to quantify volume and weight of focal portions of lung tumors in regions of interest (ROI) and volume of interest on thin-section computed tomography (CT) images by stratum of CT values.

## Methods and Materials

Volume and weight of lung portions were measured three-dimensionally and semiautomatically by CT stratum and compared with standard manual measurements. One each of a partly solid tumor (including initial and follow-up high-resolution CT scans), partly solid tumor with most parts showing solid density, and nonsolid tumors in the mid-zone of the lung were analyzed. The doubling time (DT) of tumor volume and mass were calculated by stratum of CT values.

## Results

The software-measured tumor weight in lung periphery was reproducible, with and without trimming of intervening lung structures between borders of ROIs and tumor. For the lesion in the midlung zone, the fairly thick nearby pulmonary vessels degraded the measurements, with a higher measurement error, indicating the need to trim these structures off the ROI. Software measurements allowed quantification of tumor progress based on increase in tumor mass, without significant increase in tumor volume. The DTs for both tumor volume and mass were different among the four strata of CT values in the partly solid nodule.

## Conclusion

Our semiautomated volumetric method involving measurement by CT stratum is promising for evaluation of lung tumor progress and aggressiveness.

Characterization of small lung nodules detected incidentally or on computed tomography (CT) screening is important. Clinically, it is also important to estimate the aggressiveness of lung cancers measuring 5–10 mm noninvasively because timely treatment of these tumors could usually lead to an excellent outcome . Unfortunately, it is often difficult to characterize such tumors by invasive procedures, such as transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy, contrast material-enhanced CT, and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography . Tumor growth over time has been used as a parameter to differentiate malignant from benign nodules . Furthermore, the tumor volume doubling time (TVDT), based on two time-separated measurements of the nodule diameter, has been used to quantify tumor aggressiveness. However, the TVDT does not reflect asymmetric tumor growth or growth in craniocaudal direction, which is perpendicular to the transversely oriented CT section . A three-dimensional (3D) volumetric measurement technique was also introduced recently , with the use of 3D segmentation techniques and 3D morphologic filters to isolate a pulmonary nodule with an improved result compared with a two-dimensional (2D) method. Most of the currently available software is designed to provide solid nodule volume measurement, rather than subsolid (both partly solid and nonsolid) ones, although there have been a few reports on the sophisticated methods of segmenting both subsolid and solid nodules . Although these studies have focused on clarifying temporal volume changes in lung nodules , it is important to examine not only nodule volume but also nodule density for better evaluation of tumor progress, since the development of the central denser zone (CDZ) in a nonsolid lesion (ie, transformation to a partly solid one) and the increases in size and density of CDZ in partly solid nodule or of solid nodule could indicate progress or aggressiveness of lung cancer . Kawata et al examined CT number histograms for both the whole nodule and two divided portions of the nodule (central and peripheral zones), which was segmented by a custom-made computer-aided diagnosis system and examined volume doubling time for each bin of the histogram to determine the potential usefulness of this method in discriminating benign from malignant lung nodules.

The purpose of our preliminary study was to evaluate custom-made software for semiautomated 3D volume and weight measurements of individual tissue portions of nodular lesions by stratum of CT values to help estimate the aggressiveness of lung tumor based on high-resolution CT (HRCT) scans. We also determined the temporal progression of the tumors at follow-up HRCT scans to assess the prognosis . The HRCT data of three representative patients with partly solid or nonsolid nodule were evaluated retrospectively.
