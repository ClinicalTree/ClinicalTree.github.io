## Rationale and Objectives

To determine how utilization of postgadolinium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) influenced reader accuracy and confidence at identifying postoperative soft tissue sarcoma (STS) recurrence among readers with various levels of expertise.

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective study was institutional review board approved and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant. Postoperative MRI from 26 patients with prior STS resection (13 patients with confirmed recurrence, 13 without recurrence) was reviewed. Four blinded readers of varying expertise (radiology resident, fellow, attending, and orthopedic oncologist) initially evaluated only the precontrast images and rated each MRI for recurrence on a 5-point confidence scale. Assessment was repeated with the addition of contrast-enhanced sequences. Diagnostic accuracy based on confidence ratings was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Changes in confidence ratings were calculated using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

## Results

All readers demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy both with and without contrast-enhanced images (AUC >0.98 for each reader). When contrast-enhanced images were made available, the resident recorded improved confidence with both assigning ( _P_ = 0.031) and excluding recurrence ( _P_ = 0.006); the fellow showed improved confidence only with assigning recurrence ( _P_ = 0.015); and the surgeon showed improved confidence in excluding recurrence ( _P_ = 0.003). The addition of contrast-enhanced images did not significantly influence the diagnostic confidence of the attending radiologist.

## Conclusions

Diagnostic accuracy of MRI was excellent in evaluating postoperative STS recurrence, and reader confidence improved depending on expertise when postgadolinium imaging was included in the assessment.

## Introduction

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of mesenchymal neoplasms that constitute less than 1% of all adult malignancies . Primary treatment of STS typically consists of limb-sparing surgical resection with or without radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy . The role of chemotherapy and radiation preoperatively and postoperatively can vary depending on specific diagnosis, adequacy of margin, tumor grade, and lesion location. Although the reported rates of local recurrence ranged from 6.5% to near 50% and averaging around 20% , there is no established optimal surveillance strategy given the lack of prospective data . In addition to periodic clinical assessments posttreatment, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often performed to survey for local recurrence . It is the most appropriate radiologic procedure for local recurrence surveillance of malignant or aggressive musculoskeletal soft tissue tumors based on the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria guideline . However, its utility in detecting asymptomatic recurrence has been disputed, with prior studies showing inconsistent results, and several recent studies suggesting doubtful benefits . Advanced imaging tools such as positron emission tomography hybrid imaging and functional MRI employing dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient have shown promising results in supplementing standard MRI protocols, such as improved specificity by DCE, in identifying recurrence .

Intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents are commonly used in MRI follow-up of STS after treatment . The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria express only a mild preference for MRI with and without contrast over MRI without contrast in STS surveillance . To our knowledge, there is no study in the literature evaluating a reader's ability to detect STS recurrence on postoperative MRI, which also explores the impact of contrast-enhanced pulse sequences, controlled for patients, readers, and techniques.
