## Rationale and Objectives

Endometriosis is a common women’s health problem. Animal models provide an invaluable tool to study the natural history of endometriosis. We previously have reported that  99m Tc-labeled glutamate peptide-estradiol (  99m Tc-GAP-EDL) is a useful agent for imaging functional estrogen receptor (ER) via an ER-mediated process. This study was to evaluate the feasibility of using radiolabeled GAP-EDL to image ER-positive (ER +) endometriosis in nonprimate animal models.

## Materials and Methods

3-Aminoethyl estradiol (EDL) was conjugated to glutamate peptide (GAP) to yield GAP-EDL. In vitro cellular uptake studies of  99m Tc and  68 Ga-GAP-EDL inhibition with cold estrone were conducted in 13,762 rat mammary tumor cells. To create a rabbit model with endometriosis, part of uterine tissue was dissected and grafted in the peritoneal wall. Eight weeks after surgery, scintigraphic images were obtained after intravenous injection of  99m Tc-GAP-EDL (1 mCi/rabbit, intravenous) at 0.5–2.0 hours, and  68 Ga-GAP-EDL at 45 minutes. We also performed  68 Ga-GAP-EDL blocking study in rabbit model by using tamoxifen. The rabbits were sacrificed and the grafts were excised for histologic examination.

## Results

In vitro uptake study of  99m Tc- and  68 Ga-GAP-EDL in 13,762 rat breast cancer cells showed gradually increasing uptake of both tracers. Accumulation of  68 Ga-GAP-EDL in 13,762 cells was inhibited with cold estrone in a dose-dependent manner. In the endometriosis model, the grafted uterine tissue could be visualized by  99m Tc-GAP-EDL. Necropsy was performed at 2.5 hours after injection time. Four follicular endometrial lesions in eight implanted endometrial tissues were detected, and all lesions could be detected by  99m Tc-GAP-EDL. Planar scintigraphy of uterus, ovary and implants of necropsy specimen revealed an increased uptake of  99m Tc-GAP-EDL in comparison with surrounding abdominal wall tissue. Microscopic examinations support that  99m Tc-GAP-EDL was accumulated in the microinvasive endometrial tissue. After blocking with tamoxifen,  68 Ga-GAP-EDL accumulation in the endometrial grafts could not be visualized, and endometrial tissue-to-normal tissue count ratios were statistically higher in a nonblocked image than that in the blocked image.

## Conclusions

Endometriosis uptake of radiolabeled GAP-EDL was via an estrogen receptor-mediated process. Radiolabeled-GAP-EDLs are useful agents for imaging endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a common women’s health problem that is characterized by the presence of tissue resembling endometrium outside the uterus. The exact prevalence of endometriosis in the population cannot be ascertained because of the need to perform an invasive procedure to determine who is affected. Nevertheless, estimate range from 2% to 22% in asymptomatic women, 40%–60% in women with dysmenorrhea, and 20%–30% in women being investigated for subfertility ( ). The condition causes painful periods, chronic pelvic pain, and subfertility, which are potentially debilitating; and it affects millions of women worldwide. The diagnosis is made on visual inspection of the pelvis, usually at laparoscopy. The natural history is unknown, and well-controlled experiments are difficult to perform because of the need for repeated surgical procedures to assess endometriotic lesions over time. Thus despite more than 50 years’ research, the cause of endometriosis remains unclear, and treatment options are limited ( ).

Animal models provide an invaluable tool to study risk factors, prevalence, and the natural history of endometriosis. It has been reported that estrogen receptors (ERs) are overexpressed in uterine endometrium and endometriotic lesions of patients with endometriosis. Laparoscopy observation is generally performed to detect endometriosis. The decision to perform laparoscopy on patients with infertility is very complex owing to a number of factors, such as maternal age, semen parameters, tubal patency, pelvic symptoms, insurance coverage, surgical risks, and availability of surgical expertise. Moreover, the procedure is invasive and the information obtained is morphologic and anatomic changes. Thus it would be desirable to develop radiolabeled estradiol for noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of the therapy for endometriosis.
