## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate correlations between molecular breast imaging (MBI) descriptor characteristics and positive predictive value (PPV) in detecting breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed on 193 suspicious findings from 153 women (31–81 years) with positive MBI examinations. We assessed associations between (i) lesion pattern (mass vs. nonmass) and PPV; (ii) lesion pattern and suspected likelihood of cancer (low vs. moderate vs. high); (iii) background parenchymal uptake (BPU) (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous) and PPV; (iv) breast density (dense vs. non-dense) and PPV; and (v) BPU and density.

## Results

One hundred ten of 153 patients were diagnosed with malignancy or high-risk pathology (PPV1 = 71.9%), and 130/193 biopsies resulted in malignant or high-risk lesions (PPV3 = 67.4%). Biopsies of mass vs. nonmass findings had comparable PPV3 (71.7% vs. 61.3%; _P_ = .0717). Mass findings were correlated with higher suspicion for cancer than nonmass findings ( _P_ < .001). There was no significant difference in PPV3 when comparing biopsies from homogeneous vs. heterogeneous BPU (72.5% vs. 60.7%; _P_ = .103). No association was found between patients' BPU and diagnosed cancer or high-risk lesions ( _P_ = .513). Biopsies from nondense breasts demonstrated higher PPV3 than biopsies from dense breasts (85.4% vs. 60.6%; _P_ = .0025); patients with nondense breasts were more likely to be diagnosed with cancer or high-risk pathology (PPV1 = 87.8% vs. 66.0%; _P_ = .00844). Dense breasts had a greater association with heterogeneous BPU ( _P_ = .0844).

## Conclusion

Neither variability in mass or nonmass positive MBI findings, nor variability in BPU on MBI were significant determinants for the probability of malignancy. Dense breasts were associated with lower predictability and heterogeneous BPU on MBI.

## Introduction

Molecular breast imaging (MBI), also known as breast-specific gamma imaging, is increasingly being used as an adjunct imaging modality in the detection of breast cancer. In recent years, breast-optimized gamma detectors have been noted to reliably detect tumors less than 1 cm in size . A meta-analysis in 2013 from 8 studies, including 2183 lesions, showed that the sensitivity and specificity of MBI were 95% and 80%, respectively . In addition to demonstrating a sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing breast cancer comparable to that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), MBI also has many advantages for clinical use . While mammography is affected by breast density, MBI has been shown to be reliable irrespective of breast density . MBI is also a feasible screening alternative for women who refuse to undergo MRI due to claustrophobia, which may hinder up to about 25% of women, including those at high breast cancer risk .

Currently accepted clinical and research indications of MBI include, but are not limited to, the extent of disease/preoperative staging in newly diagnosed breast cancer, the evaluation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the detection of local breast cancer recurrence, the evaluation for primary breast cancer in women with metastases or metastatic axillary lymphadenopathy of unknown primary, breast cancer screening, an adjunct to conventional breast imaging for problem solving in indeterminate cases, technically difficult breast imaging, and patients for whom breast MRI would be indicated but is not possible due to renal insufficiency, implanted devices, body habitus, or claustrophobia .
