## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of cryoablation on pain levels in patients with histories of post-thoracotomy pain syndrome.

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen patients were included in this retrospective review. Preprocedural and immediate postprocedural pain scores were recorded, as well as several months after the procedures.

## Results

The average preprocedural pain score was 7.5 ± 2.0, which decreased to 1.2 ± 1.9 immediately after the procedure. After a mean follow-up period of 51 days, the average pain score was 4.1 ± 1.7. The difference between preprocedural and postprocedural pain scores was statistically significant by Wilcoxon's rank sum test.

## Conclusion

Cryoneurolysis of the intercostal nerves statistically significantly decreased pain scores in patients with post-thoracotomy pain syndrome.

Neuropathic pain is a common problem that results from a variety of different etiologies. Prominent among these are diabetic peripheral neuropathy, postsurgical change, postherpetic neuralgia, and chronic radiculopathy . The pain that results is often refractory to therapy, requiring a multidisciplinary treatment approach including pharmacologic management, interventional procedures, and lifestyle modification . Cryotherapy for analgesia has been used since 1976 and has been shown to effective and safe . Combining this procedure with image guidance has been postulated to further reduce the risk for complications, specifically pneumothorax, when used to alleviate post-thoracotomy pain . In contrast to both medical treatment and other invasive procedures, such as neurectomy, significant pain relief is achieved acutely with cryoablation, and the recovery period is relatively brief . In the literature, cryoneurolysis has been studied mainly in the context of post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, because this is a frequently encountered problem. Most of the currently available literature focuses on intraoperative cryoablation of the intercostal nerves. There are few currently published articles on the treatment of patients with post-thoracotomy pain syndrome months or years after thoracotomy has been performed .

The aim of this retrospective study was to determine if computed tomographic (CT) cryoneurolysis is an effective method of reducing pain in patients with post-thoracotomy pain syndrome.
