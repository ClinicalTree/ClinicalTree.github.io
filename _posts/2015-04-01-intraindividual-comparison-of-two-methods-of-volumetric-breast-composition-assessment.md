## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the results of two software-based methods, Quantra and Volpara, for volumetric breast composition assessment.

## Materials and Methods

Four hundred forty-five normal, bilateral, two-view, digital mammograms were included. Breast volume (BV), fibroglandular tissue volume (FTV), and percent density (PD) were measured using both methods and compared. Deming regression was performed to obtain linear equations for mapping the results of one software on the other.

## Results

The median and quartile ranges of both methods agreed well for BV but were different for FTV and PD, with Quantra showing much higher values of FTV and PD. The correlation of results obtained by both methods for BV, FTV, and PD was 0.99, 0.91, and 0.94, respectively. Intraclass correlation in the assignment of quartiles of BV, FTV, and PD was 0.96, 0.86, and 0.90, respectively. Both methods showed a similar association of FTV and PD with patient age and similar left-to-right correlation. Mapping of results onto each other using linear equations removed the systematic differences.

## Conclusions

Although Quantra and Volpara use different models for analysis of volumetric breast composition and produce different nominal results of FTV and PD, both methods are highly correlated and show very good to excellent agreement in quartile assignment of all parameters measured. Both methods show a similar association with patient age and similar reproducibility. Both methods can be mapped onto each other using the equations suggested.

Mammographic breast density is a strong predictor of breast cancer . Recent studies indicate that it may also be a useful parameter for assessing the response to tamoxifen and for estimating the prognosis of breast cancer patients . Breast density also strongly affects the sensitivity of screening mammography and may be used as a variable to individualize screening regimens in the future .

Visual breast density assessment, which is used in most clinical and many research settings, is fast but is limited by only moderate inter-reader and intra-reader agreement . Semiquantitative methods were developed to improve reproducibility, but are time consuming because they require reader interaction . More recently, several methods for automated volumetric breast composition assessment have been introduced which provide fast and highly reproducible quantification of breast density and absolute volumes of breast tissue components . Different models are used to derive the volumes of breast tissue components from digital mammogram raw data, and these produce very different results . This potentially limits the applicability of the results of research studies using either technique. Although the Quantra software (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA) uses the acquisition parameters of the mammogram together with a model of x-ray attenuation of different breast tissues, the Volpara software (Mātakina, Wellington, New Zealand) uses “relative physics,” with features of the mammogram to be analyzed for calibration . Individual software algorithms have been compared to visual assessment of breast density and to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a reference standard . However, owing to the different models used, it is not clear how the results obtained with different softwares can be compared to each other. The aim of this study was to perform intraindividual comparison of two volumetric breast composition assessment software methods, the Quantra and Volpara, 1) to determine whether there is a linear or a more complex relationship between the results obtained with both methods and 2) to determine how results from one software can be compared to those from the other.
