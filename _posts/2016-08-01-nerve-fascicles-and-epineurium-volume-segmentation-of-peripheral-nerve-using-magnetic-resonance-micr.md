## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to propose a semiautomated technique to segment and measure the volume of different nerve components of the tibial nerve, such as the nerve fascicles and the epineurium, based on magnetic resonance microneurography and a segmentation tool derived from brain imaging; and to assess the reliability of this method by measuring interobserver and intraobserver agreement.

## Materials and Methods

The tibial nerve of 20 healthy volunteers (age range = 23–69; mean = 47; standard deviation = 15) was investigated at the ankle level. High-resolution images were obtained through tailored microneurographic sequences, covering 28 mm of nerve length. Two operators manually segmented the nerve using the in-phase image. This region of interest was used to mask the nerve in the water image, and two-class segmentation was performed to measure the fascicular volume, epineurial volume, nerve volume, and fascicular to nerve volume ratio (FNR). Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were calculated.

## Results

The nerve structure was clearly visualized with distinction of the fascicles and the epineurium. Segmentation provided absolute volumes for nerve volume, fascicular volume, and epineurial volume. The mean FNR resulted in 0.69 with a standard deviation of 0.04 and appeared to be not correlated with age and sex. Interobserver and intraobserver agreements were excellent with alpha values >0.9 for each parameter investigated, with measurements free of systematic errors at the Bland-Altman analysis.

## Conclusions

We concluded that the method is reproducible and the parameter FNR is a novel feature that may help in the diagnosis of neuropathies detecting changes in volume of the fascicles or the epineurium.

## Introduction

Peripheral nerve pathology reflects in a variety of histopathologic patterns. The Seddon classification is traditionally used to divide acute nerve injuries into neuroapraxia (axonal strain with temporary functional loss), axonotmesis (axonal cut short with Wallerian degeneration), and neurotmesis (discontinuity also of the supporting connective tissues) . Chronic neuropathies are associated with additional modifications such as collagen deposition on the extracellular matrix, basement membrane thickening and changes in volume of the connective sheaths (ie, the epi-, peri- and endoneurium), nerve fibers loss, demyelination, remyelination, and Schwann cell proliferation .

The assessment of peripheral nerve disorders is achieved through medical history and physical examination, supported by instrumental investigations including electrophysiology, nerve biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Electrophysiology detects gross distribution of nerve dysfunction, but it is limited for determining the exact location of nerve injury and cannot depict morphological alterations within the nerve . Histopathology may be carried out in vivo with the biopsy of the sural nerve, which can be sacrificed in restricted circumstances. Furthermore, the sural nerve contains only sensitive fibers and the specimens may not necessarily represent the underlying disease . MRI is the most advanced imaging technique available for the study of peripheral nerves, with the advantages to be noninvasive and repeatable . Standard protocols for MRI of peripheral nerves, also known as magnetic resonance (MR) neurography , include high-resolution axial T1-weighted and fat-suppressed T2-weighted images . As injured nerves appear hyperintense on T2-weighted images, several studies have focused on the increased T2 relaxation time to evaluate the nerve damage . However, the morphological detail usually achieved is insufficient for visualization of the single nerve fascicles and the tissues within and around.

In these scatter plots, the Y axis represents the differences of the two measurements, which are plotted against their mean represented on the Y axis. The central horizontal line represents the mean difference of the two examiners, and the upper and lower lines represent their agreement limits, in which at least 95% of the data points lie. All confidence interval limits of the mean include the zero line, thus no statistically significant bias is present between the measurements.
