## Rationale and Objectives

Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems fundamentally require the opinions of expert human observers to establish “truth” for algorithm development, training, and testing. The integrity of this “truth,” however, must be established before investigators commit to this “gold standard” as the basis for their research. The purpose of this study was to develop a quality assurance (QA) model as an integral component of the “truth” collection process concerning the location and spatial extent of lung nodules observed on computed tomography (CT) scans to be included in the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) public database.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred CT scans were interpreted by four radiologists through a two-phase process. For the first of these reads (the “blinded read phase”), radiologists independently identified and annotated lesions, assigning each to one of three categories: “nodule ≥3 mm,” “nodule <3 mm,” or “non-nodule ≥3 mm.” For the second read (the “unblinded read phase”), the same radiologists independently evaluated the same CT scans, but with all of the annotations from the previously performed blinded reads presented; each radiologist could add to, edit, or delete their own marks; change the lesion category of their own marks; or leave their marks unchanged. The post-unblinded read set of marks was grouped into discrete nodules and subjected to the QA process, which consisted of identification of potential errors introduced during the complete image annotation process and correction of those errors. Seven categories of potential error were defined; any nodule with a mark that satisfied the criterion for one of these categories was referred to the radiologist who assigned that mark for either correction or confirmation that the mark was intentional.

## Results

A total of 105 QA issues were identified across 45 (45.0%) of the 100 CT scans. Radiologist review resulted in modifications to 101 (96.2%) of these potential errors. Twenty-one lesions erroneously marked as lung nodules after the unblinded reads had this designation removed through the QA process.

## Conclusions

The establishment of “truth” must incorporate a QA process to guarantee the integrity of the datasets that will provide the basis for the development, training, and testing of CAD systems.

The Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) was established by the National Cancer Institute through a peer review of applications submitted in response to its Request for Applications in 2000 entitled “Lung Image Database Resource for Imaging Research.” Through this Request for Applications, the National Cancer Institute outlined the requirements for a well-characterized repository of computed tomography (CT) scans to stimulate the development of computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods by the thoracic imaging research community. The intent of this initiative was to create a consortium of institutions that would develop consensus guidelines for a standardized database of thoracic CT scans that would serve as a reference standard for CAD investigators ( ). The mission of the LIDC is to develop the database as an “international research resource for the development, training, and evaluation of CAD methods for lung cancer detection and diagnosis” ( ).

The distinction between the collection of images as a repository of clinical CT scans and the creation of a reference standard as a robust research resource has guided the efforts of the LIDC since its inception. The LIDC database has been designed to serve specifically as a reference standard. Accordingly, the CT scans that comprise the database are accompanied by associated “truth” information to more completely facilitate lung nodule CAD research ( ). The creation of a reference database carries a burden of accuracy and completeness that demands a complex process; the multi-institutional nature of the LIDC effort further compounds the complexity of the task. This same complexity necessitates a systematic review of the collected “truth” information to identify and correct potential errors.

![Figure 2, A schematic representation of the two-phase image annotation process for the asynchronous interpretation of thoracic CT scans by four radiologists at different institutions. A CT scan is distributed to the four sites, and an experienced thoracic radiologist at each site identifies appropriate lesions through the blinded read phase, the annotations of which are recorded in XML files. A single XML file that merges the four sets of annotations from the blinded read phase is distributed to the same four radiologists to initiate the unblinded read phase, which involves a second review of the scan along with the blinded read phase results of all radiologists. The single XML file that then merges the four sets of annotations from the unblinded read phase is evaluated during the quality assurance process.
