## Rationale and Objectives

Accuracy of ultrasound-guided biopsy and Gleason score is limited, and diagnosis of insignificant cancer with Gleason score ≤6 is frequent when extended biopsy schemes are used. We evaluated whether the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted in-bore prostate biopsy correctly identifies the Gleason score of prostate cancer in histopathologic correlation after prostatectomy. Simultaneously a targeted concept is expected to keep down the rate of insignificant cancer.

## Materials and Methods

We compared retrospectively the Gleason score of the MRI-targeted in-bore biopsy with prostatectomy specimens in 50 men with prostate cancer. Endorectal MRI included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, and spectroscopy. Lesions with a prostate imaging–reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score ≥3 were considered. Upgrading and downgrading of tumors was evaluated, and significant upgrading was defined as a shift in Gleason score from 6 to 7 or more.

## Results

Gleason score was concordant in 66% of the patients, overall upgraded in 30% of patients, and downgraded in 4% of patients. Significant upgrading of the Gleason score from 6 to 7 occurred in eight patients; upgrading did not exceed one step in the Gleason score. After prostatectomy the Gleason score 6 was found in 20% of patients. The median number of cores obtained was 4 (range 2–6), and the median number of positive cores was 2 (range 1–4).

## Conclusions

In-bore MRI-targeted biopsy offers good accuracy in the Gleason score with postprostatectomy histopathologic control when compared to the literature. A limited number of cores are sufficient to achieve these results. The fraction of insignificant cancer identified by targeted only-biopsy is low. Upgrading is restricted to one step in the Gleason score. Clinicians should be aware of positive findings in MRI and the biopsy technique used when assessing prostate biopsy results.

Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer among men. Widespread use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has led to an increasing number of diagnoses and at the same time to an increasing detection rate of insignificant cancer. Prediction of cancer significance is predominantly based on the Gleason score. According to the Consensus Conference on Gleason grading, the Gleason score combines the most frequent and the highest Gleason grade in biopsy and the most frequent and second most frequent Gleason grade in prostatectomy specimens .

Now there are alternative treatment options to radical prostatectomy (RP) such as radiation therapy or active surveillance. Appropriate treatment depends on preoperative tumor grading in biopsy specimens.
