## Rationale and Objectives

Diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) for neural fibers of the head-and-neck region at 3T has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using DTT for visualizing neural fibers in the head-and-neck region at 3T and to explore the use of this method in patients with head-and-neck mass lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Using a 3T scanner, we obtained magnetic resonance images of the head and neck region in 5 healthy volunteers and 5 patients with head and neck mass lesions. All subjects underwent anatomic T1-weighted and diffusion-tensor imaging using a sequence with six motion-probing gradient orientations, a _b_ value of 800 second/mm  2 , and a 128 × 128 pixel matrix. Fiber tracking was with the continuous tracking method. Different postprocessing parameters were investigated to optimize fiber density detection and minimize noise. In five patients with head-and-neck mass lesions, comparison of tractography results and operative findings with regards to mass and nerve relationship was also performed by two observers.

## Results

Using the two regions-of-interest method, the greatest fiber density of presumed inferior alveolar nerves was depicted at a maximum angle of 40° and a minimum fiber length of 10 mm. DTT was successfully depicted in all 5 patients. In 4 patients, the relationship between DTT and operative findings was coincided or similar. The interobserver agreement was good.

## Conclusions

DTT of the neural fibers in the head and neck region is feasible using a clinical 3T magnetic resonance scanner. Data from a small number of patients with head-and-neck lesions show good agreement between tractography and operative results.

Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) and fiber tractography or diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) can be used to visualize the three-dimensional macroscopic fiber tract architecture . These techniques, widely used to demonstrate specific white matter tracts, are useful for evaluating various pathologic conditions in the brain . They have also been applied to visualize neural fibers of the cranial nerves .

Surgery of the head and neck raises the possibility of cranial or cervical nerve damage . Understanding the relationship between the course of nerve fibers and lesions of the head and neck may help to prevent postoperative neurologic complications. To our knowledge, DTT for neural fibers of the head-and-neck region at 3 T has not been reported, probably because of susceptibility or chemical shift artifacts. DTT with a 3-T MRI scanner using a parallel imaging technique and a fat saturation method may allow visualization of the neural fibers in the head and neck. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of DTT to depict neural fibers in the head and neck using a 3-T MRI scanner, a parallel imaging technique, and a fat saturation method.

(a) In the single region-of-interest (ROI) method, the ROI ( pink area ) was manually placed to cover the orifice of the right inferior alveolar canal in the mandible on transverse ( left ) and coronal ( right ) b = 0 image of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the two-ROI method, the first ROI was identically placed and the second ROI ( brown area ) was placed 1 cm apart and above the first ROI. On the DTT images obtained with the two-ROI method with a maximum angle of 40° and a minimum fiber length of 10 mm, the presumed inferior alveolar nerve bundles ( green tract ) to the inferior alveolar canal are depicted. (b) With the single-ROI method with a maximum angle of 60° and a minimum fiber length of 10 mm, DTT images superimposed on transverse ( left ) and coronal ( right ) b = 0 image of diffusion-weighted MRIs showed many “noise” fibers that appear to be muscle fibers.
