## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in prostate cancer.

## Materials and Methods

The MEDLINE, Embase, CANCERLIT, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published from January 2001 to August 2011 evaluating the diagnostic performance of DWI in detecting prostate carcinoma. Sensitivities and specificities were determined across studies, and summary receiver-operating characteristic curves were constructed using hierarchical regression models.

## Results

Sixteen studies (18 subsets) with a total of 852 patients were included. Six studies (seven subsets) examining men with pathologically confirmed prostate cancer (260 patients) had pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.88 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.76–0.95) and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76–0.90), respectively. Compared to patients at high risk for clinically relevant cancer, sensitivity was higher in low-risk patients (0.94 \[95% CI, 0.89–0.97\] vs 0.62 \[95% CI, 0.54–0.70\], _P_ < .05), but specificity was lower (0.86 \[95% CI, 0.72–0.94\] vs 0.89 \[95% CI, 0.83–0.93\], _P_ < .05). Ten studies (11 subsets) examining patients with suspected prostate cancer (592 patients) had pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.68–0.84) and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79–0.91). Sensitivity was lower in high-risk patients (0.74 \[95% CI, 0.57–0.87\] vs 0.78 \[95% CI, 0.70–0.84\], _P_ \> .05), but specificity was higher (0.92 \[95% CI, 0.89–0.94\] vs 0.78 \[95% CI, 0.70–0.84\], _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

A limited number of small studies suggest that DWI could be a rule-in test for high-risk patients. Further prospective studies including larger populations are necessary to confirm the actual value of DWI in this field.

The early detection of prostate cancer is essential to decrease mortality rates. Several diagnostic methods have been applied in recent years to detect the malignant changes within the prostate. As a result of widespread screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate cancer is increasingly being detected at an early stage . However, the specificity of PSA level for prostate cancer screening is limited, and even if PSA levels are between 2.5 and 4 ng/mL, cancer is detected in 25% to 30% of biopsies .

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) of the prostate is the primary method worldwide. It is used not only to gain a first impression of the organ but also to guide prostate biopsies, if necessary . But TRUS has limitations in diagnostic performance of randomized sextant biopsies, as first illustrated by Levine et al , who analyzed the results of 137 men subjected to two consecutive sets of biopsies in a single office visit and showed that 30% of the cancers were detected exclusively in the second biopsy set. This was then confirmed in the European Prostate Cancer Detection Study, in which in 820 of 1051 patients with negative results on first TRUS-guided biopsies, cancer was detected in 10% ( _n_ = 83) on repeat biopsy .

Evaluation of Quality of Included Studies Using the Quality Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy Tool


Number Quality Item Positive Score 1 Was the spectrum of patients representative of the patients who will receive the test in practice? Only patients with primary cancer were included 2 Were selection criteria clearly described? It was clear how patients were selected to undergo DWI 3 Is the reference standard likely to enable correct classification of the target condition? Only histopathologic analysis after surgery was used as the reference standard 4 Is the time period between reference standard and index test short enough to be reasonably sure that the target condition did not change between the two tests? <30 days 5 Did the whole sample or a random selection of the sample receive verification with a reference standard? All patients or a random selection of the patients received verification with histopathologic analysis after surgery 6 Did patients receive the same reference standard regardless of the index test result? All patients received the same reference standard regardless of response at therapy 7 Was the reference standard independent of the index test (the index test did not form part of the reference standard)? The DWI findings did not form part of the reference test 8 Was the execution of the index test described in sufficient detail to permit replication of the test? The DWI protocol was described 9 Was the execution of the reference standard described in sufficient detail to permit its replication? Sufficient details or citations were reported to permit replication of the reference standard 10 Were the index test results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the reference standard? Interpretation of DWI was performed without knowledge of histopathologic findings 11 Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of the results of the index test? Interpretation of the reference test results was performed without knowledge of DWI findings 12 Were the same clinical data available when test results were interpreted as would be available when the test is used in practice? Clinical data such as age, sex, and clinical stage were available when DWI was interpreted 13 Were uninterpretable/intermediate test results reported? All DWI results, including uninterpretable and/or intermediate results, were reported 14 Were withdrawals from the study explained? It was clear what happened to all patients who entered the study
