## Rationale and Objectives

Viewers of electronic education exhibits at the 2013 and 2014 Radiological Society of North America meetings had the opportunity to “like” exhibits, as one might “like” a Facebook or an Instagram post. The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate for a relationship between exhibit popularity and receiving an award or _RadioGraphics_ invitation, (2) to evaluate for a relationship between exhibit recognition and subsequent popularity, and (3) to quantify and compare the electronic education exhibit likes at the 2013 and the 2014 meetings.

## Materials and Methods

Exhibit likes were recorded at the midpoints and ends of both meetings. Data analyses were performed by means of one-way analysis of variance and chi-square tests.

## Results

There were similar numbers of electronic education exhibits at the 2013 (1856) and 2014 (1793) meetings with no significant difference between meeting years in the number of exhibits chosen for awards (423 vs. 404, _P_ = 0.88) or for _RadioGraphics_ solicitation (190 vs. 169, _P_ = 0.46). In both meeting years, there were statistically significant associations between initial and overall exhibit popularity and exhibit recognition, as well as between exhibit recognition and subsequent popularity. A 152% increase in total likes recorded was observed at the 2014 meeting as compared to the 2013 meeting (11074 vs. 4391, _P_ < 0.0001).

## Conclusions

Popular exhibits were significantly more likely to receive awards and _RadioGraphics_ invitations. Receiving an award or _RadioGraphics_ invitation was associated with subsequent increased exhibit popularity. Significantly more likes were recorded at the 2014 Radiological Society of North America meeting than at the 2013 meeting.

## Introduction

With the rapid growth and widespread adoption of social media, there has been increasing interest in social media's impact on and interaction with the field of medicine and the subspecialty of radiology . More specifically, previous researchers have investigated and analyzed the use of social media at major medical society meetings across a number of specialties, with most work to date focused on third-party social media sites such as Facebook (  facebook.com , Menlo Park, CA) and Twitter (  twitter.com , San Francisco, CA) .

The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) introduced a form of medical societal social media at its 2013 annual meeting by offering Digital Presentation System (DPS) electronic education exhibit (EEE) viewers the opportunity to “like” an exhibit, just as one might “like” a Facebook or an Instagram post. This feature was again made available to EEE viewers at the 2014 RSNA meeting. The number of likes received by each exhibit was visible to all other meeting attendees in real time, and for each like recorded, the lead exhibit author received an automated e-mail notification containing the viewer's name. All in-person and virtual meeting attendees had the option of liking an unlimited number of EEEs; however, each attendee could like a specific exhibit only once.
