## Rationale and Objectives

An animal model of partial hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) has benefits for decision making and clinical management after liver transplantation or massive hepatic resection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the change in perfusion parameters after partial hepatic I/R in rabbits using multislice computed tomography perfusion imaging.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty rabbits underwent 60 minutes of left hepatic lobar ischemia followed by 0.5, 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours of reperfusion (six rabbits were used for each reperfusion interval). An additional six rabbits served as sham-operated controls. The perfusion indices of hepatic arterial perfusion, hepatic portal perfusion, total liver perfusion, and hepatic perfusion index were measured. Levels of serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase and liver histopathology at different time points were also examined.

## Results

Hepatic microvascular flow patterns showed heterogeneity in the 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour groups. Computed tomographic perfusion parameters were significantly different between infarcted liver tissue and viable liver tissue. In poorly enhancing tissues in the 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour groups, hepatic portal perfusion and total liver perfusion were lower compared to the sham group, but hepatic arterial perfusion of poorly enhancing tissues significantly increased in the 6-hour group and then decreased slightly from 12 to 24 hours after reperfusion. The hepatic perfusion index was always higher compared to that of the sham group. Hepatic arterial perfusion, hepatic portal perfusion, total liver perfusion, and hepatic perfusion index in the noninfarcted areas decreased slowly from 6 to 24 hours after reperfusion. The levels of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase in the I/R groups significantly increased after reperfusion and were correlated with the computed tomographic perfusion indices of infarcted liver tissue.

## Conclusions

Computed tomographic perfusion can dynamically monitor the pathologic processes of liver I/R and reveal the underlying microvascular disorder, improving clinical management after liver surgery.

Ischemia/reperfusion injury (I/R) in the liver is a critical factor affecting organ and patient survival, especially after massive hepatic resection or liver transplantation. I/R can cause cellular injury and induce cell death, as well as cause acute organ failure and chronic rejection after liver transplantation, and is therefore associated with high morbidity and mortality . Accumulating evidence suggests that microcirculatory disturbances and capillary perfusion failure, subsequent to I/R, are major factors in the pathogenesis of I/R-mediated liver injury. Heterogeneity of hepatic microvascular perfusion is more pervasive, and blood flow within individual sinusoids may become completely blocked .

Although serum levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) activities are used to assess the degree of liver function loss, they do not offer spatial information regarding liver injury . It is important to further localize infarcted tissues and functional properties of the liver as well as vascular and extravascular complications (quantification and localization of damaged liver tissue). Therefore, the ability to quantitatively assess hemodynamic changes in the capillary network in hepatic I/R has become a major challenge for radiologists.

![Figure 1, Computed tomographic perfusion maps of hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP), hepatic portal perfusion (HPP), and hepatic perfusion index HPI (rain map). The 0.5-hour group (b) showed a lack of perfusion pattern, with obvious declines in HAP, HPP, and total liver perfusion (TLP), compared to the sham group (a) . (c) HAP and HPI increased significantly after 2 hours of reperfusion as well as a moderate rise in HPP. (d) The low-enhancement area (regions of interest [ROIs] T4–T6) can be distinguished from the ischemia-induced left lobe in the 6-hour group. The increase in HAP and decrease in HPP in the low-enhancement area (ROIs T4–T6) contrast with the enhancement of viable liver tissue (ROIs T1–T3), implying an “arterial buffer response,” and are also an indicator of deficient blood supply to the liver parenchyma. (e) As depicted in the 24-hour group, HAP, HPP, and TLP significantly decreased in both poorly enhancing and viable enhancing liver tissues, implying progressive infarction of liver tissue.

![Figure 2, Computed tomographic perfusion parameters and enhancement patterns between infracted and viable liver tissues. (a) Hepatic arterial perfusion (HAP) in the infarcted liver tissues increased significantly in the 6-hour group and decreased gradually in the 12-hour and 24-hour groups. However, HAP in noninfarcted liver tissues decreased gradually. (b) Hepatic portal perfusion (HPP) decreased significantly in infarcted tissues compared to that of the noninfarcted liver tissues. (c) Total liver perfusion (TLP) showed a similar change as HPP in the infarcted versus viable liver tissues. (d) The sharp rise in hepatic perfusion index (HPI) in the infarcted tissues implies the action of an “arterial buffer response.” Differences in perfusion indices between the noninfarcted and infarcted tissues of the 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour groups ( 1 P < .05, 2 P < .01); between the sham group and the infarcted tissues of 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour groups ( 1′ P < .05, 2′ P < .01); and between the sham group and the noninfarcted tissues in the 6-hour, 12-hour, and 24-hour groups ( 1″ P < .05, 2″ P < .01).
