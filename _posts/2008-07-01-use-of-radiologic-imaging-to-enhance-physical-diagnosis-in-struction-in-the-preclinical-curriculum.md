## Rationale and Objectives

To expose students in the premedical years to imaging and its indications, to enhance their understanding of pathologic processes by allowing direct visualization, and to teach physical diagnosis through an integrated, multispecialty approach.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 166 second-year medical students participated in a novel imaging session that accompanied the physical diagnosis course they were concurrently enrolled in. Students were provided a didactic orientation to imaging and taught how to use Picture Archiving and Communications System software. The students then participated in interactive imaging sessions in which they were able to scroll through entire imaging cases of real, anonymized patients with accompanying clinical scenarios and physical examination findings.

## Results

Of 89 students responding to an online curricular feedback questionnaire, 41% believed that the imaging correlated with the other information taught in the course and 46% found it was helpful to their learning. The majority of students (64%) believed that the sessions helped challenge them to think about physical diagnosis in a different way.

## Conclusion

Physical diagnosis on the wards requires a multispecialty approach and the early introduction of this technique through the integrated mode of teaching we present will benefit students in their clinical years and future careers.

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing shift toward the integration of diagnostic radiology into the preclinical curriculum, particularly in gross anatomy. However, the time exclusively devoted to teaching anatomy through imaging remains low, with a recent survey of 60 US and Canadian medical schools indicating that only 5% of time is spent on radiologic anatomy ( ). Most efforts continue to focus on the use of radiology in basic science courses, but few have examined the role of radiology in enhancing the teaching of physical diagnosis to medical students.

As the role of imaging has taken the forefront in all arenas of clinical medicine, it has become imperative to begin the process of introducing radiology earlier in the medical school curricula. It has been documented that early exposure to radiology in problem-based learning modules improves medical students' impression of radiology as a specialty and increases their interest in radiology as a career ( ).

Excerpts from Surveys


Positive Evaluations Negative Evaluations “The entire image view was helpful, and I liked how the software let us see different cuts and showed where on the body the coronal sections were.” “Consider having radiology residents/more attendings to help us through cases.” “Having spent 2 years in a Neuro-ICU helping coordinate a research study that followed SAH survivors, my knowledge of MRI and CT as yet very basic … this tutorial helped me learn more about how the rest of the body looks when imaged, and also introduced me to the fun part- playing with the screen controls and imaging parameters on the viewing program online. I loved that!” “Radiology should be spread out over the year when relevant to ongoing coursework.” “This was very helpful … it is good to start integrating material that we will need to know on wards and also to help us actually understand pathology rather than just memorize it.” “… I feel like smaller groups would work better to provide for adequate interaction between faculty and students when discussing the cases.” “It helped to see radiologic images in the context of an illness.” “I had radiology for the first time in this course and felt overwhelmed because we hadn't yet learned any pathology.” “Since in class we only see one or two images per case, it was good to see the entire MRI or CT, not only the most important view.” “I think it would be better if there was some outside reference on reserve in the library we could just look at before going to a session.”
