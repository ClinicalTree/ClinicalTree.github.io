In January 2017, we lost a friend, colleague, and advocate for radiology education, Mark Robbin. Many of us know Mark through his leadership roles in musculoskeletal radiology and diagnostic radiology resident education. In recent years, Mark's leadership in the Association of Program Directors in Radiology as the co-Chair of the Survey Committee transformed the process, elevated the relevance and importance of the survey findings, and was instrumental in publishing its results to the benefit of program directors and residents everywhere. Mark was a Professor, Vice Chair, Residency Program Director, Fellowship Program Director, and a Division Director—an exceptionally impressive array of leadership roles exemplifying his unwavering commitment to education and service. His many professional successes were highlighted by his friendly, kind, supportive, and encouraging manner. It was a delight to work with him and he seemed upbeat and ever cheerful…always smiling (an accurate rendering of this is provided on his obituary website:  http://fredcdames.com/tribute/details/4274/Dr–Mark-Robbin–M-D-/obituary.html#content-start ).

Mark's positive attitude was also a great catalyst for effecting change. It is noted from his obituary that he will be memorialized through the naming of the Radiology Residents Library that he helped establish at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, where he served as Diagnostic Radiology Program Director, as well as the renaming of an Orthopedic-Radiologic-Pathologic correlation lecture. It is likely that he would have found the attention humbling but the selections appropriate.

Mark R. Robbin, MD, completed his undergraduate work at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he received a bachelor of science with highest honors. Following this, Mark received a Dean's Scholar Award and graduated from the University of Southern California School of Medicine. Mark completed his Radiology Residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center where he served as Chief Resident. Subsequently, Mark completed a Musculoskeletal Radiology Fellowship at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. From 2001 until 2016, Mark served as Chief of Musculoskeletal and Emergency Radiology and Musculoskeletal Radiology Fellowship Program Director. From 2006 through 2016, Mark served as Diagnostic Radiology Residency Program Director. Mark was named Teacher of the Year in the Department of Radiology an exceptional eight times, being so honored in three different decades. Quite aptly, in 2015, University Hospitals/Case Western Reserve University honored him with a Distinguished Educator Award. In addition to many US Radiology Residents, Mark mentored 34 Musculoskeletal Radiology Fellows and 35 international Radiology Residents. Mark was an author on 36 papers, 61 abstracts, and 3 book chapters, and served as an editor twice. A sought-out speaker, Mark presented 77 invited lectures, including Grand Rounds, nationally and internationally. His immutable spirit and determination will be missed, but his contributions to radiology education will live on through those he touched.

We send our sincere condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues.
