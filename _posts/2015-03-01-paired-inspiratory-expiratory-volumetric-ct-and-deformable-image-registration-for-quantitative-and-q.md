## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate paired inspiratory/expiratory computed tomography (CT; iCT/eCT) and deformable image registration for quantitative and qualitative assessment of airflow limitation in smokers.

## Materials and Methods

Paired iCT/eCT images acquired from 35 smokers (30 men and 5 women) were coregistered and subtraction images (air trapping CT images \[aCT\]) generated. To evaluate emphysema quantitatively, the percentage of low-attenuation volume (LAV%) on iCT was calculated at −950 HU, as were mean and kurtosis on aCT for quantitative assessment of air trapping. Parametric response maps of emphysema (PRMe) and of functional small airways disease (PRMs) were also obtained. For qualitative evaluation of emphysema, low-attenuation areas on iCT were scored by consensus of two radiologists using Goddard classification. To assess air trapping qualitatively, the degree of air trapping on aCT was scored. For each quantitative and qualitative index, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for forced expiratory flow in 1 second was calculated, and differences in correlation coefficients were statistically tested.

## Results

The correlation coefficients for the indices were as follows: mean on aCT, 0.800; kurtosis on aCT, −0.726; LAV%, −0.472; PRMe, −0.570; PRMs, −0.565; addition of PRMe and PRMs, −0.653; emphysema score, −0.502; air trapping score, −0.793. The indices showing significant differences were as follows: mean on aCT and addition of PRMe and PRMs ( _P_ = 1.43 × 10  −8 ); air trapping score and emphysema score ( _P_ = .0169).

## Conclusions

Air trapping images yielded more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of airflow limitation than did LAV%, PRMe, PRMs, and Goddard classification.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by chronic and progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible . According to a projection made in 2002, COPD is expected to become the fourth leading cause of death in the world by 2030 . Moreover, COPD is the only one with a steadily rising prevalence among the four major causes of mortality: cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD .

Airflow limitation in COPD is caused by lung parenchymal destruction (emphysema) and small airways disease. Contributions of these two components to airflow limitation vary substantially from patient to patient, thus potentially affecting clinical presentation, disease severity, and therapeutic response . Furthermore, separate assessment of emphysema and small airways disease provides valuable information regarding disease heterogeneity for identification of COPD phenotypes .

where CT is the CT attenuation of a lung voxel. They also showed that lung inflation (mL/g) could be calculated with the Equation  (2) :


lunginflation=specificvolume−0.939,

,


where specific volume is the inverse value of density. Using Equations  (1) and (2) and coregistered inspiratory/expiratory CT, the difference in lung inflation (mL/g) between inspiration and expiration can be calculated as Equation  (3) :


differenceinlunginflation=10001000+CTi−10001000+CTe,

where CTi and CTe are CT attenuation of lung voxels in co-registered inspiratory/expiratory CT. The Equation  (3) can be converted to the Equation  (4) :


differenceinlunginflation=1000×(CTe−CTi)(1000+CTi)×(1000+CTe).

.


The last equation clearly shows that the difference in CT attenuation between coregistered inspiratory and expiratory CT is directly related to the difference in lung inflation although the relationship is nonlinear. For this reason, we hereafter refer to subtraction CT images as air trapping images because of their potential to reflect the air trapping caused by small airways disease.
