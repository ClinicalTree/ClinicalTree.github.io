## Rationale and Objectives

When soft tissue sarcomas are treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the number of cycles of chemotherapy is usually dependent on the tumor's initial response. Popular methods to assess tumor response include Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria, which rely solely on tumor size, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) reduction in positron emission tomography (PET), which requires an expensive and high radiation test. We hypothesized that contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may offer a good alternative by providing additional information beyond tumor size.

## Materials and Methods

Following IRB approval, a retrospective review identified patients with soft tissue sarcomas who underwent both PET and MRI before and after two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five readers independently examined the MRI exams for: changes in size, T2 or T1 signal, necrosis and degree of enhancement. Readers then made a subjective binary assessment of tumor response to therapy. Each reader repeated the anonymized randomized reading at least 2 weeks apart. 18 F-FDG PET exams were interpreted by a nuclear medicine specialist. The maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) for pre and post-chemotherapy exams were compared. Intra- and inter-reader agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa and Light's kappa, respectively. .

## Results

Twenty cases were selected for this multireader study, of which 9 (45%) were responders and 11 were nonresponders by SUVmax. Using all MRI criteria, 43% were classified as responders based on MRI and 1.5% were classified as responders by RECIST criteria. Using PET as the reference, the sensitivity and the specificity of the MRI diagnosis for response using all findings were 50% and 63%, respectively. There was fair to moderate intrareader (kappa = 0.37) and inter-reader (kappa = 0.48) agreement for the MRI diagnosis of response. None of the individual MRI signal characteristics were significantly different between the PET responders and nonresponders. Additionally, no MRI findings were significantly different between those with and without good clinical responses.

## Conclusion

By our assessment, there is a poor correlation between tumor response by RECIST criteria and PET SUVmax. In addition, varying MR features did not help in diagnosing tumor response. Imaging of tumor response remains a challenging area that requires further research.

## Introduction

Soft tissue sarcomas are rare connective tissue tumors with high mortality that are challenging to treat . Surgery and radiation therapy are the hallmarks of local disease control, but neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapies have been shown to improve outcomes in select circumstances, such as large, high-grade, and recurrent tumors . Different chemotherapy regimens are used ; at our institution, the typical protocol is to start with two cycles of AIM (doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and mesna). After the initial two cycles, the decision to use more chemotherapy is made based on the tumor's initial response, both clinically and on imaging, in addition to the patient's tolerance of the treatment .

The traditional use of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which uses change in tumor size to assess tumor response, has been shown to be unreliable in soft tissue sarcomas . Studies have shown that a significant reduction in maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on \[F-18\]Fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography-computed tomography (  18 F-FDG/PET-CT) correlates better with histopathologic response and with improved outcomes . However, positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is an expensive, time-consuming, and high-radiation test. PET-CT, in conjunction with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been shown to be useful when distinguishing viable tumor from post-treatment changes . Our providers typically obtain contrast-enhanced MRI at various time points during treatment to assess tumor response, but the criteria to assess response based on MRI have not been well established. Currently, patients with sarcoma at our institution undergo a mixture of PET-CT and contrast-enhanced MRIs after chemotherapy to assess for response, sometimes one or the other, and only occasionally both imaging modalities at the same time.
