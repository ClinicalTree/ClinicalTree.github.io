## Rationale and Objectives

Shunt surveillance is a critical component of follow-up for patients with cirrhosis with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS). Transabdominal Doppler ultrasound analysis of the shunt has been used as a noninvasive means of assessing shunt function. Doppler ultrasound analysis of the shunt is less sensitive than direct transjugular portosystemic pressure gradient measurement for detecting shunt failure. A wireless, noninvasive means of measuring the portosystemic pressure gradient in the clinic may facilitate follow-up in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to determine if two implanted wireless pressure sensors could accurately transmit a portosystemic pressure gradient across a TIPS.

## Materials and Methods

Two wireless microelectromechanical system pressure sensors were placed in a swine model for measuring the portosystemic pressure gradient across a TIPS. Catheter-based pressure transducers were also placed and used as the gold standard. Pressures from both systems were measured concurrently.

## Results

Wireless microelectromechanical system portal and systemic pressure measurements were accurate within ±2 mm Hg (mean, 0.86 mm Hg) of the gold standard.

## Conclusion

The use of wireless sensors may facilitate the surveillance of shunt function in patients with portal hypertension who have undergone placement of TIPS.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) have played a major role in the management of portal hypertension . Use of VIATORR covered stents (W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc, Flagstaff, AZ) has extended the 1-year primary patency rate of shunts to 84% . However, shunt surveillance remains a critical component of patient follow-up in preventing potentially fatal variceal bleeding. Contrast toxicity and radiation exposure preclude the regular use of transjugular pressure gradient measurement for assessing shunt function. The sensitivity of Doppler ultrasound for detecting shunt occlusion and stenosis is 96% and 94%, respectively . Body habitus and operator inexperience limit the usefulness of this modality.

Wireless microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have been used to provide pressure data to surgeons during endovascular aortic aneurysm repair. A wireless MEMS sensor is deployed inside the aneurysm sac during exclusion of the aneurysm with an endograft. A reduction in intrasac pulse pressure ≥ 30% indicates that the aneurysm is successfully excluded. The Acute Pressure Measurement to Confirm Aneurysm Sac Exclusion (APEX) trial demonstrated agreement between the EndoSure MEMS sensor (CardioMEMS, Inc, Atlanta, GA) and angiography in detecting type I and III endoleaks in 92.1% ( _n_ = 70), with sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 80% . The purpose of our study was to assess the accuracy of a wireless CardioMEMS device for measuring the portosystemic pressure gradient across a TIPS in a swine model. If proven useful, this sensor may make surveillance of TIPS shunts in the clinic possible.
