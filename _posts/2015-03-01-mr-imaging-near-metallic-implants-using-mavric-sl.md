## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the effectiveness of multiacquisition with variable resonance image combination selective (MAVRIC SL) with conventional two-dimensional fast spin-echo (2D-FSE) magnetic resonance (MR) techniques at 3T in imaging patients with a variety of metallic implants.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-one 3T MR studies were obtained in 19 patients with different types of metal implants. Paired MAVRIC SL and 2D-FSE sequences were reviewed by two radiologists and compared for in-plane and through-plane metal artifact, visualization of the bone implant interface and surrounding soft tissues, blurring, and overall image quality using a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. The area of artifact on paired images was measured and compared using a paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. Changes in patient management resulting from MAVRIC SL imaging were documented.

## Results

Significantly less in-plane and through-plane artifact was seen with MAVRIC SL, with improved visualization of the bone–implant interface and surrounding soft tissues, and superior overall image quality ( _P_ = .0001). Increased blurring was seen with MAVRIC SL ( _P_ = .0016). MAVRIC SL significantly decreased the image artifact compared to 2D-FSE ( _P_ = .0001). Inclusion of MAVRIC SL to the imaging protocol determined the need for surgery or type of surgery in five patients and ruled out the need for surgery in 13 patients. In three patients, the area of interest was well seen on both MAVRIC SL and 2D-FSE images, so the addition of MAVRIC had no effect on patient management.

## Conclusions

Imaging around metal implants with MAVRIC SL at 3T significantly improved image quality and decreased image artifact compared to conventional 2D-FSE imaging techniques and directly impacted patient management.

Metallic orthopedic implants are now commonplace in modern joint and spine surgery. However, subsequent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of symptomatic patients with orthopedic hardware is often limited by metallic susceptibility artifacts, resulting in signal loss, pileup artifact, and geometric distortion . Two MR imaging methods have recently been introduced that significantly reduce susceptibility artifact near metal implants: slice encoding for metal artifact correction (SEMAC) and multiacquisition variable resonance image combination (MAVRIC) . Both techniques use multiple excitations to excite the overall volume being imaged, but SEMAC excites standard slices (limited spatial bands), whereas MAVRIC excites limited frequency bands. As the extent of susceptibility, artifact is directly proportional to field strength; these metal suppression sequences are typically applied at field strengths no higher than 1.5 Tesla (1.5T) . However, the increasing use of 3 Tesla (3T) scanners makes it important to develop and evaluate metal suppression techniques at higher field strengths.

The SEMAC technique uses additional phase encoding in the slice direction to correct for through-plane distortion, combined with view-angle tilting (VAT) and a spin-echo acquisition to avoid in-plane distortion and T2\* signal loss. The three-dimensional (3D) spin-echo acquisition is used to resolve the profile of each excited slice in the region of interest. MAVRIC excites a series of limited spectral bandwidths and uses the same 3D spin-echo readout to resolve distortion, exploiting the limited excited frequency range to avoid in-plane distortion. Overall, MAVRIC's spectral overlap strategy to smoothly combine separately encoded spectral bins tends to yield composite images that have higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) than images constructed with SEMAC's nonoverlapping slices . Unfortunately, in cases where surface coils fail to provide adequate volume selectivity around large joints, such as the hip and shoulder, MAVRIC's lack of _z_ -selectivity can result in significant through-plane aliasing.

Pulse sequence diagram for multiacquisition with variable resonance image combination selective (MAVRIC SL), where RF is radiofrequency, G  z  is the slice-select gradient, G  y  is the phase-encoding gradient and G  x  is the frequency-encoding gradient. The MAVRIC SL sequence is based on a standard spin-echo train imaging sequence (such as three-dimensional fast spin-echo, Cube, Space, VISTA). The excitation and refocusing RF pulses are Gaussian shaped, with overlap between adjacent excited regions, which are typically about 8- to 12-mm thick. Typically, a reduced refocusing flip angle (135° or 120°) is used instead of 180°, to reduce specific absorption rate. Phase encoding in both slice and phase directions is used, allowing the sequence to resolve through-slice distortions. A view-angle–tilting gradient is applied on the slice axis during the readout gradient to correct in-plane distortions.
