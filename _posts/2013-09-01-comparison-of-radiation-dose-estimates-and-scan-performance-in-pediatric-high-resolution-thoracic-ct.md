## Rationale and Objectives

Efforts to decrease radiation exposure during pediatric high-resolution thoracic computed tomography (HRCT), while maintaining diagnostic image quality, are imperative. The objective of this investigation was to compare organ doses and scan performance for pediatric HRCT using volume, helical, and noncontiguous axial acquisitions.

## Materials and Methods

Thoracic organ doses were measured using 20 metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor dosimeters. Mean and median organ doses and scan durations were determined and compared for three acquisition modes in a 5-year-old anthropomorphic phantom using similar clinical pediatric scan parameters. Image noise was measured and compared in identical regions within the thorax.

## Results

There was a significantly lower dose in lung (1.8 vs 2.7 mGy, _P_ < .02) and thymus (2.3 vs 2.7 mGy, _P_ < .02) between volume and noncontiguous axial modes and in lung (1.8 vs 2.3 mGy, _P_ < .02), breast (1.8 vs 2.6 mGy, _P_ < .02), and thymus (2.3 vs 2.4 mGy, _P_ < .02) between volume and helical modes. There was a significantly lower median image noise for volume compared to helical and axial modes in lung (55.6 vs 79.3 and 70.7) and soft tissue (76.0 vs 111.3 and 89.9). Scan times for volume, helical, and noncontiguous axial acquisitions were 0.35, 3.9, and 24.5 seconds, respectively.

## Conclusion

Volumetric HRCT provides an opportunity for thoracic organ dose and image noise reduction, at significantly faster scanning speeds, which may benefit pediatric patients undergoing surveillance studies for diffuse lung disease.

Pediatric diffuse lung disease encompasses a broad range of heterogeneous disorders affecting interstitial, airspace, and small airways . High-resolution computed tomography of the thorax (HRCT) is increasingly used in children for the evaluation of a wide range of diffuse lung diseases . HRCT allows for detailed, noninvasive imaging of the lung parenchyma, thus facilitating demonstration of interstitial lung disease patterns and differential diagnosis, guiding further diagnostic workup and therapy. However, the primary disadvantages of HRCT in children are the image degradation from motion, especially since young children are unable to suspend respiration, and ionizing radiation exposure. Radiation exposure, from all sources, is of paramount concern in children. Compared to adults, children are at greater risk for cancer development at similar radiation exposures due to longer life expectancy and increased radiosensitivity from rapidly growing tissues . Radiation exposure to the female breast is of particular concern with pediatric HRCT. It has been estimated that exposure of the female breast before 35 years of age to 10 mGy increases the risk of cancer development by 14% over the spontaneous rate in the general population . Therefore, efforts to decrease radiation exposure during pediatric HRCT, while maintaining diagnostic image quality are imperative.

The two most widely used methods of acquiring HRCT involve either sampling the lungs with thin (typically 1 mm), noncontiguous axial sections at varying intervals (typically 10–20 mm) or retrospectively deconstructing a helically acquired volumetric data set in thin axial sections at desired intervals. There are several reports in the medical literature comparing image quality between noncontiguous axial and helical HRCT in adults and children , but none to our knowledge have compared true volumetric acquired versus helical and noncontiguous axial acquired HRCT. In addition, while Bastos et al compared total effective dose (using the relatively inaccurate method of multiplying published conversion factors by console-displayed dose–length product \[DLP\]) in pediatric HRCT performed using helical versus noncontiguous axial acquisitions, they did not measure and compare thoracic organ doses .

Figure 1


Graphic illustration of the three acquisition methods available to obtain high-resolution thoracic computed tomography. During noncontiguous axial acquisition, the X-ray tube is collimated to a narrow nominal beam width (1 mm in this investigation's case) and rotates around the patient for one rotation. The tube is then turned off while the patient table is translated 10 mm, at which point the tube is turned back on and undergoes another rotation. This process repeats until the desired scan length is covered. During helical acquisition, a wider nominal beam width is used (32 mm in this investigation's case) and the tube rotates continuously while the patient table simultaneously translates. During volume mode, a single rotation covers the entire anatomy (up to 160 mm) and there is no table translation during the acquisition.

A single axial dose profile ( red curve ) demonstrates the dose contribution of an individual rotation at the center of a 16-cm-diameter acrylic phantom. The individual dose profile is repeated ( blue curves ) to show individual noncontiguous axial acquisitions at 10-mm intervals along the z -axis. The widespread scatter tails from each rotation are additive and makeup the cumulative dose ( solid purple curves ) plotted on the same normalized dose scale. The dotted purple curves are repeats of the central purple curve and are provided to help visualize the cumulative dose pattern if scan length was infinite. The valleys of the cumulative dose curve are approximately 70% of the peak doses, demonstrating that the doses in regions between each acquisition are only 30% less than the dose directly under the X-ray tube. In addition, note that the relative peak doses from the 14 noncontiguous axial images are 250% that of the peak dose from a single 1-mm axial exposure.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ComparisonofRadiationDoseEstimatesandScanPerformanceinPediatricHighResolutionThoracicCTforVolumetric320DetectorRowHelical64DetectorRowandNoncontiguousAxialScanAcquisitions/6_1s20S1076633213002699.jpg)
