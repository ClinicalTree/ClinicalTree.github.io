Despite ever-increasing utilization of cross-sectional imaging, fluoroscopy continues to play an important role in the field of radiology. _Practical Fluoroscopy of GI and GU Tracts_ is a first-edition text by Drs. Levine, Ramchandani, and Rubesin. True to its title, the book is practical. It offers technique tips and troubleshooting advice while also providing a concise yet comprehensive review of the pertinent pathology. With just short of 500 images packed into 234 pages, it is an easy read for those just starting out or a good reference for those who just need a quick refresher.

There are 11 chapters in total. Two chapters are devoted to the evaluation of the GU tract, and the remaining chapters cover the GI tract. There are three chapters devoted to examination techniques and normal anatomy, which are divided into upper GI, small bowel, and colon. These chapters provide step-by-step instructions for performing various fluoroscopic techniques while also discussing pertinent findings and potential pitfalls. The remaining chapters are divided by anatomic region and discuss common pathologic diseases manifested in these regions. These chapters include pharynx, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and colon.

The ample number of images provided is truly a highlight and brings this already well-written text to the next level. This book is an excellent resource for practicing radiologist and residents alike. It provides the information needed to perform the procedures in a concise step-by-step fashion. It is concise and high-yield, making it useful as both as a primary text book as well as a reference text.
