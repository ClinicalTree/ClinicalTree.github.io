## Rationale and Objectives

Patient-centered outcome measures have become an essential focus in research methodology in recent years. This may be particularly challenging in imaging research at the technology assessment level to incorporate patient-centeredness. A primary issue in this field is designing a reference standard that is applicable to the entire study population.

## Materials and Methods

This important element is necessary for translation of findings into clinical practice. In our work, computed tomographic perfusion imaging is being evaluated as a new technology used in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients to detect cerebral vasospasm. We have developed a new reference standard employing a multistage hierarchical design incorporating both clinical and imaging criteria to determine a diagnosis of vasospasm.

## Results

A flowchart of the reference standard levels is provided for illustration. The limitations and potential biases that may occur using this reference standard are discussed.

## Conclusions

This reference standard will be applicable to the entire study population, including those with and without symptoms or further imaging with digital subtraction angiography.

In the past several years, there has been growing public interest in the management of health care, resource allocation, and improving patient outcomes. Patient involvement in health care issues has become a primary initiative by the consumer and government policy makers. It is our interest to incorporate patient-centeredness into research methodology using outcome measures. However, it may be challenging particularly in imaging research at the technology assessment level to incorporate patient-centeredness into research methodology. Littenberg describes incorporating the overall medical, psychologic, and financial effects of the technology into assessing patient outcomes. This includes the unintended side effects and long-term morbidity and mortality. The selection of an appropriate reference standard that is representative of patient outcomes from a patients' perspective is complex. The primary obstacle to overcome is to design a reference standard that is applicable to the entire population that the imaging study is intended for use in clinical practice. Analyses performed on a subgroup of the population due to limitations with the reference standard, such as only symptomatic patients receive the reference standard test, may yield important findings that are not translatable to the clinical population. This limitation is not always recognized when applying the literature in clinical practice for determining management and treatment decisions.

In our work, computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) is being evaluated as a new technology used in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (A-SAH) patients to detect cerebral vasospasm. In the clinical care setting, CTP is intended for use on all patients with A-SAH, including patients with and without symptoms. It then becomes important to implement a reference standard in the research methodology that is applicable to the entire target population, including those with and without symptoms and those who will not have additional imaging performed. We have specifically developed a new reference standard to address these limitations using a multistage hierarchical design incorporating both clinical and imaging criteria for determination of vasospasm.
