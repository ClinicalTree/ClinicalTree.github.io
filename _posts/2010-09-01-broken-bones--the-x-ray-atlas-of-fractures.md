_Broken Bones: The X-Ray Atlas of Fractures_ is a unique and affordable eBook atlas of fractures, as demonstrated by radiographs and computed tomography. This eBook was created specifically for the Amazon Kindle device and iPhone/iTouch users alike for an online price of $19.95 at the time of publishing. A total of 369 cases and 939 radiologic images are presented in this atlas. Most of the images are drawn from cases seen at Harborview Medical Center (Seattle, WA), which is the Level 1 Trauma Center that serves the states of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. Additional cases were drawn from the teaching collections of the University of Washington and from the teaching collections of the authors.

The fracture atlas is conveniently arranged anatomically with a table of contents including hand, wrist, forearm/elbow/upper arm, shoulder/thorax, spine, pelvis/hip, thigh/knee, lower leg/ankle, foot, and face fractures sequentially. The clarity of the images is excellent on both the kindle and iPhone devices with above-average brightness settings. The atlas can be purchased on  Amazon.com and transmitted wirelessly to your mobile device with text to speech functionality for Kindle devices (except first generation). The file size is 21749 kb with unlimited simultaneous device usage after purchase. iPhone/iTouch users must download the  Amazon.com free Kindle App from the Apple App store on their mobile device to view the purchased eBook after logging into their personal  Amazon.com account through the application. This process takes less than 5 minutes from the time of purchase; then, the one-of-a-kind fracture atlas can be viewed easily in its full brilliance.

I find _Broken Bones: The X-Ray Atlas of Fractures_ useful for medical students, practicing radiologists, radiology residents and fellows, orthopedists, emergency practitioners, and others generally interested in the imaging of fractures. In Chapter 1, illustrations are provided of fractures and dislocations involving the hand, beginning with injuries to the distal phalanges of the fingers, continuing with injuries of the distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and metacarpophalangeal joints, and ending with injuries of the carpometacarpal joints. In Chapter 2, fractures and dislocations of the wrist, including fractures and dislocations of the individual carpal bones and combinations of carpal bones, perilunate injuries, radiocarpal injuries, distal radius injuries, and isolated distal radioulnar joint injuries are considered. Chapter 3 begins with forearm injuries, including Galeazzi, Monteggia, and Essex-Lopresti fracture-dislocations, continues with elbow fractures and dislocations, and ends with humeral shaft fractures. In Chapter 4, fractures and dislocations about the shoulder and shoulder girdle, including the proximal humerus, scapula, clavicle, and thoracic cage, are illustrated. Examples of fractures and dislocations of the spine are seen in Chapter 5, beginning with the craniocervical junction, including the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, and ending with the sacrum. Chapter 6 begins with injuries of the pelvic ring and includes injuries of the acetabulum, hip joint, and proximal femur. In Chapter 7, injuries of the femoral shaft and knee are illustrated. Chapter 8 covers injuries of the lower leg and ankle. Chapter 9 illustrates fractures and dislocations of the talus, calcaneus, midfoot, and forefoot, ending with the toes. Chapter 10 is devoted to fractures and dislocations of the face. References are provided at the end of the eBook.

I was quite surprised at how easy this text is to navigate through with the provided hyperlinks within the eBook itself and the movements through the electronic pages with the flick of a finger. The descriptions of each fracture are short and clear, which is perfect for the mobile casual learner. This eBook can easily be read from cover to cover within a month in a casual fashion by navigating through a few fractures at a time. After exiting the application, automatic bookmarks are placed so you can pick up reading/flicking right where you left off. Short, concise, and accurate fracture descriptions and management captions are provided for each fracture. The intrinsic pan/zoom features built into the iPhone/iTouch are seamlessly incorporated into the eBook as well, making it very simple to magnify and manipulate the radiologic images with the touch of your fingers.

When I showed the eBook to my orthopedic resident colleagues, they were astounded by the clarity of the images and the excellent descriptions and management excerpts incorporated within the captions. The main beauty of this fracture atlas is embedded within its simplicity, comprehensiveness, and ease of use. This truly pioneer work is a hallmark of the future of education in a technologically advanced world. The authors are ahead of their time and have capitalized on the blooming eBook market, obviously anticipating the benefits of this mode of mobile educational delivery. One can now learn and enjoy anytime, anywhere.

_Broken Bones: The X-Ray Atlas of Fractures_ is an excellent eBook with informative detail and comprehensive information regarding common fracture patterns. It is a strong resource for every general or musculoskeletal radiologist, orthopedist, emergency room physician, or medical student to have on hand. Outstanding clarity in this mobile eBook illustrates the anatomy and radiologic images of various fractures in the axial and appendicular skeleton. This is an outstanding comprehensive reference on imaging of fractures helping radiologists and clinicians become familiarized with the myriad of appearances of fractures that can be commonly seen at a Level I trauma center. I am thrilled at the prospect of seeing more eBooks like this in the future.
