## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to determine interobserver variability in volume measurements of lung tumors (including part-solid and nonsolid types) using novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and a machine learning approach and to determine the potential reasons for variability.

## Materials and Methods

In 60 consecutive patients with peripheral lung cancer, the three-dimensional volumes of nodules were measured using the perimeter method by an experienced chest radiologist. In addition, for the same patients, maximal diameters and three-dimensional volumes were measured with and without a novel CAD tool by six observers. The coefficient of variance (CV) as index of interobserver variability was calculated. For the measurement of volume, the results of the perimeter method were compared to those of the CAD method. Furthermore, the CV was calculated for the following subgroups: nodule diameter, internal opacity, margin, spiculation, and adherence to vessels and the chest wall.

## Results

There was significant interobserver variability among the six observers for manual, but not CAD, measurements of maximal diameter ( _P_ < .001 and _P_ = .207, respectively). Volume measured with the perimeter method by a chest radiologist was well correlated with volume measured with the aid of the CAD system by six radiologists ( _r_ = 0.98–0.99). There was no significant difference in the CV for size, internal opacity, spiculation of nodules, or adherence to pulmonary vessels and the chest wall. The CV was significantly higher for obscure marginal nodules than for clear marginal nodules ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

The novel CAD tool could be used to measure the volume of not only solid but also part-solid and nonsolid lung tumors.

Measurements of the sizes and volumes of lung tumors are useful for the assessment of staging and the results of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. On follow-up computed tomographic (CT) imaging, it is important to determine whether a pulmonary nodule has grown and, if so, how fast it has grown. The doubling time of pulmonary nodules is one of the clues used to differentiate malignant from benign nodules. Malignant solid nodules typically double in volume in <500 days .

Nodule size is usually the average diameter of a nodule on an axial CT image. The maximal diameter of a tumor determines the T category in the international TNM classification of lung cancer . Furthermore, the World Health Organization proposed uniform guidelines using two-dimensional (2D) methods for the evaluation of tumor response. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors are based on measurements of maximal perpendicular tumor diameters in the axial plane. However, manual measurements of the largest diameters on 2D CT imaging vary substantially between observers, and measurements using serial CT examinations may be limited in the evaluation of treatment response or assessment of doubling times . Because nodule growth or shrinkage is a three-dimensional (3D) phenomenon, direct volume calculation should be more accurate than diameter measurement .

Then, a three-dimensional optimal path is calculated and output as the nodule boundary. The computer-aided diagnosis software also provides a convenient function for correction. If there are imperfects in the segmented result, on the basis of an additional mouse click to designate where the correct position is, the software can automatically output a new three-dimensional path that passes through the correct position.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SemiautomaticVolumetricMeasurementofLungCancerUsingMultidetectorCT/0_1s20S107663320900261X.jpg)
