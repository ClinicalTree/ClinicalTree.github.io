## Rationale and Objects

We describe a new web-based physics course for radiology residents preparing for the Exam of the Future (EOF).

## Materials and Methods

A course was developed with a total of 12 web-based modules. Six modules were focused on “imaging” and six on “radiation.” A module was subdivided into nine short “nuggets.” Traditional lectures were replaced by modules using prerecorded lectures (Tegrity) to a secure website (WebCT). Each module was accompanied by three quizzes, each consisting of ten questions designed to reinforce covered materials. All online modules were accompanied by a noon conference that employed an Audience Response System (Turning Point). Seventeen first-year residents over 2 consecutive years beginning in July 2010 took this new course, and participated in an anonymous online follow-up survey (Survey Monkey).

## Results

The recorded 12 modules had an overall average duration of 72 ± 19 minutes. Ten of 17 residents expressed a preference of 15 minutes for nugget duration. Highest personal assessment scores of each resident's understanding were obtained in human radiation risks and radiation protection. Residents considered supplemental noon conferences to be important for learning radiological physics. Satisfaction level was largely positive, with five residents highly satisfied, nine residents somewhat satisfied, two residents neutral, and only one resident somewhat dissatisfied.

## Conclusions

Our _Foundations of Radiological Physics_ course was well received and served as the springboard for mastering x-ray–based imaging modalities of radiography, mammography, fluoroscopy, interventional radiology, and computed tomography.

The chairman of Radiology at the Medical College of Georgia, Dr. James Rawson, has defined a radiologist as a physician who manages the electromagnetic spectrum and ultrasound wave spectrum for the benefit of the patient . To perform this role, a radiologist must undergo formal training in radiological physics. Competency in this aspect of radiological imaging also needs to be assessed when radiology residents are examined by the American Board of Radiology (ABR). The advent of time-limited ABR certification, and the introduction of a Maintenance of Certification system of continual assessment of radiologists, implies that understanding of radiological physics is likely to become increasingly important for the practice of medical imaging.

In the past decade or so, radiology residents have generally taken an ABR written physics examination at the beginning of their second or third year of residency, a written diagnostic examination at the beginning of their third or fourth year of residency, and an oral examination at the end of a 4-year residency. Radiology residents who commenced their training in 2010, however, will now take a computer-based core examination after 36 months of residency, and a computer-based qualifying examination 15 months after the completion of their 4 years of resident training . Radiological physics will no longer constitute a separate examination, but will be integrated into the core examination, and important physics aspects of medical imaging are expected in the qualifying examination as well as in future examinations as part of the Maintenance of Certification process. By this means, radiological physics is expected to become more clinically focused and address important topics on dose and image quality that all practicing radiologists are expected to understand. Of particular importance is the fact that a passing score in radiological physics and safety sections will still be required for a resident to pass the ABR core examination.
