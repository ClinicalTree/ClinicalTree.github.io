## Rationale and Objectives

The characterization of payments made to physicians by pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and group purchasing organizations is crucial for assessing potential conflicts of interest and their impact on practice patterns. This study examines the compensation received by general radiologists (GR) in the United States, as well as radiologists in the following five subspecialties: body imaging, neuroradiology, pediatric radiology, nuclear radiology and radiological physics, and vascular and interventional radiology.

## Materials and Methods

Data were extracted from the Open Payments database for radiology subspecialists in the United States who received installments in calendar year 2015 from pharmaceutical and device manufacturing companies.

## Results

In 2015, a total of $43,685,052 was paid in 65,507 payments (mean $667/payment; median $32/payment) to radiologists, including 9826 GR, 362 body imaging radiologists, 479 neuroradiologists, 127 pediatric radiologists, 175 physicians in nuclear radiology and radiological physics, and 1584 vascular and interventional radiologists. Payments were unequally distributed across these six major subspecialties of radiology ( _p_ < 0.01), with GR receiving the largest number of total payments (44,695), and neuroradiologists receiving significantly higher median payments than any other subspecialty ($80 vs $32 for all radiologists; _p_ < 0.01). Medtronic Neurovascular was the single largest payer to all radiologists combined.

## Conclusion

Commercial entities make substantial payments to radiologists, with a significant variation in payments made to the different radiology subspecialties. While the largest number of total payments was made to GGR, the highest median payments were made to neuroradiologists, and significant dispersion in these payments was seen across different geographic regions. The impact of these payments on practice patterns remains to be elucidated.

## INTRODUCTION

The 2010 Affordable Care Act included a list of provisions designed to improve transparency of relationships between physicians and industry, namely the Physicians Payment Sunshine Act ( ). This Act mandates that all payments and offerings made by industry to physicians (save for certain exclusions such as sample medications), be reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which serves as the central database for the Act ( ). Specifically, manufacturers and medical suppliers must submit all payments >$10 made to physicians to the CMS, at which point physicians have 45 days to submit a dispute ( ). Such payments are tracked by unique provider ID and may include research funding, gifts, consultant fees, or funds allocated for medical education, among others ( ). According to prior reports, as many as 94% of US physicians currently maintain some form of financial relationship with commercial entities ( ).

Driven by public interest for transparency within the healthcare industry, the Sunshine Act helps to identify existing relationships between physicians and industry, and also sheds light on potential conflicts of interest that may exist and what influence, if any, such relationships may have on medical practice patterns ( ). The CMS database is updated yearly and results are made available online, providing public access to any payments made by pharmaceutical companies, device manufacturers, and group purchasing organizations toward physicians and other healthcare providers such as dentists, chiropractors, and podiatrists.
