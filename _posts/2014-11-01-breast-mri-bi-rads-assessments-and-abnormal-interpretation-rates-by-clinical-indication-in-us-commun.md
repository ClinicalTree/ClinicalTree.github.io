## Rationale and Objectives

As breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use grows, benchmark performance parameters are needed for auditing and quality assurance purposes. We describe the variation in breast MRI abnormal interpretation rates (AIRs) by clinical indication among a large sample of US community practices.

## Materials and Methods

We analyzed data from 41 facilities across five Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium imaging registries. Each registry obtained institutional review board approval for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliant analysis. We included 11,654 breast MRI examinations conducted in 2005–2010 among women aged 18–79 years. We categorized clinical indications as 1) screening, 2) extent of disease, 3) diagnostic (eg, breast symptoms), and 4) other (eg, short-interval follow-up). We characterized assessments as positive (ie, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System \[BI-RADS\] 0, 4, and 5) or negative (ie, BI-RADS 1, 2, and 6) and provide results with BI-RADS 3 categorized as positive and negative. We tested for differences in AIRs across clinical indications both unadjusted and adjusted for patient characteristics and registry and assessed for changes in AIRs by year within each clinical indication.

## Results

When categorizing BI-RADS 3 as positive, AIRs were 21.0% (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 19.8–22.3) for screening, 31.7% (95% CI, 29.6–33.8) for extent of disease, 29.7% (95% CI, 28.3–31.1) for diagnostic, and 27.4% (95% CI, 25.0–29.8) for other indications ( _P_ < .0001). When categorizing BI-RADS 3 as negative, AIRs were 10.5% (95% CI, 9.5–11.4) for screening, 21.8% (95% CI, 19.9–23.6) for extent of disease, 17.7% (95% CI, 16.5–18.8) for diagnostic, and 13.3% (95% CI, 11.6–15.2) for other indications ( _P_ < .0001). The significant differences in AIRs by indication persisted even after adjusting for patient characteristics and registry ( _P_ < .0001). In addition, for most indications, there were no significant changes in AIRs over time.

## Conclusions

Breast MRI AIRs differ significantly by clinical indication. Practices should stratify breast MRI examinations by indication for quality assurance and auditing purposes.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive modality for detecting breast cancer, often identifying malignancy otherwise occult by mammography, ultrasound, and clinical breast examination . As the technology improves and the interpretation and reporting by radiologists become standardized, breast MRI is used for an increasing number of purposes, including high-risk screening, evaluation of extent of malignancy, evaluation of patients with metastatic axillary adenopathy and unknown primary cancer, and surveillance after cancer treatment . Moreover, the technology has now become readily available in community settings throughout the United States with interpretation and reporting completed by both subspecialty-trained breast imagers and general radiologists .

To facilitate consistent reporting of and management recommendations for breast MRI findings, the American College of Radiology published the first edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) MRI lexicon in 2003, with the most recently revised edition published in 2013 . Similar to the previously established BI-RADS mammography lexicon, the breast MRI lexicon provides common terminology for describing MRI findings. Standardized use of the lexicon and BI-RADS assessment categories allows for improved communication among radiologists and clinicians with regards to suspicious imaging findings and clinical recommendations . Recent studies have shown that the MRI BI-RADS assessment categories can accurately predict the risk of malignancy .
