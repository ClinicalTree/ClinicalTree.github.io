## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to characterize early hepatic lipid changes in an experimental model of liver fibrosis using proton (  1 H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at high magnetic field in vivo.

## Materials and Methods

Liver fibrosis was induced in 12 Sprague-Dawley rats by twice-weekly carbon tetrachloride (CCl  4 ) administration up to 4 weeks. Eight normal rats were used as controls. Single-voxel  1 H MRS experiments were performed at 7 Tesla to measure signal integrals of various lipid peaks including –CH  3 , (–CH  2 –)  n , –CH  2 –C=C–CH  2 –, =C–CH  2 –C= and –CH=CH– at 0.9, 1.3, 2.0, 2.8, and 5.3 ppm, respectively, and peak from choline-containing compounds (CCC) at 3.2 ppm. Total lipid, total saturated fatty acid, total unsaturated fatty acid, total unsaturated bond, polyunsaturated bond, and CCC indices were quantified.

## Results

Significant increases ( _P_ < .01) in total lipid and total saturated fatty acid indices were found in animals with CCl  4 -induced fibrosis as compared with normal animals. In addition, total unsaturated bond and polyunsaturated bond indices of animals at 4 weeks after CCl  4 insult were significantly higher than ( _P_ < .01 and _P_ < .05, respectively) those of normal animals and animals at 2 weeks following insult; whereas there was only significant increase ( _P_ < .01) in total unsaturated fatty acid index in animals with 4-week CCl  4 insult as compared with normal animals.

## Conclusion

The hepatic lipid changes in CCl  4 -induced experimental fibrosis model were documented in vivo and longitudinally using  1 H MRS at 7 Tesla. The experimental findings suggested that total saturated fatty acid increase contributed mainly to the total lipid increase in animals with CCl  4 insult. This study also demonstrated the potential value of high field MRS to resolve lipid composition and alterations in liver fibrosis.

Liver fibrosis associated with chronic liver injury can progress to cirrhosis and ultimately hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) . Percutaneous liver biopsy has been considered the standard technique for diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is highly invasive and associated with risk of complications, limiting its applicability in longitudinal monitoring of fibrosis progression or regression in response to treatment . Because disease progression to liver cirrhosis can be prevented by early interventions and treatments , there has been a great interest in the development of noninvasive techniques for early diagnosis and characterization of liver fibrosis. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  1 H MRS) allows the study of cellular biochemistry and metabolism, and provides a noninvasive means to determine disease abnormalities and progression in vivo and longitudinally. Liver lipid content, which has been suggested to play an important pathogenic role in the development of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , can be measured by  1 H MRS noninvasively. Most importantly, specific lipid changes related to saturated and unsaturated fatty acids can be monitored in vivo by high resolution  1 H MRS.

Carbon tetrachloride (CCl  4 ) intoxication is a well-characterized, reproducible and the most commonly used experimental animal model of liver fibrosis. It has been widely studied with respect to the histological, biochemical, cellular, and molecular changes associated with development of fibrosis . By interfering hepatic energy metabolism and protein synthesis, CCl  4 -induced hepatotoxicity can lead to triglyceride accumulation, mitochondrial injury, and necrosis . With the increased availability of high-field (≥3.0 Tesla) magnetic resonance (MR) systems for clinical and preclinical studies, both signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution of metabolites in the MR spectra can be improved significantly , allowing more accurate metabolite identification and quantification and thus disease characterization. Although MRS can provide insights into liver metabolism noninvasively, detailed in vivo  1 H MRS study of liver fibrosis with high spectral resolution has been limited . The aim of this study was to characterize early hepatic lipid changes in the experimental CCl  4 -induced liver fibrosis model by means of single-voxel  1 H MRS at high magnetic field in vivo.
