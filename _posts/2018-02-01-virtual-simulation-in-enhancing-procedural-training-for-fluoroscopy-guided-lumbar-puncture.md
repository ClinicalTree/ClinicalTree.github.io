## Rationale and Objectives

Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is a basic procedural component of radiology residency and neuroradiology fellowship training. Performance of the procedure with limited experience is associated with increased patient discomfort as well as increased radiation dose, puncture attempts, and complication rate. Simulation in health care is a developing field that has potential for enhancing procedural training. We demonstrate the design and utility of a virtual reality simulator for performing FGLP.

## Materials and Methods

An FGLP module was developed on an ImmersiveTouch platform, which digitally reproduces the procedural environment with a hologram-like projection. From computed tomography datasets of healthy adult spines, we constructed a 3-D model of the lumbar spine and overlying soft tissues. We assigned different physical characteristics to each tissue type, which the user can experience through haptic feedback while advancing a virtual spinal needle. Virtual fluoroscopy as well as 3-D images can be obtained for procedural planning and guidance. The number of puncture attempts, the distance to the target, the number of fluoroscopic shots, and the approximate radiation dose can be calculated. Preliminary data from users who participated in the simulation were obtained in a postsimulation survey.

## Results

All users found the simulation to be a realistic replication of the anatomy and procedure and would recommend to a colleague. On a scale of 1–5 (lowest to highest) rating the virtual simulator training overall, the mean score was 4.3 (range 3–5).

## Conclusions

We describe the design of a virtual reality simulator for performing FGLP and present the initial experience with this new technique.

## Introduction

Lumbar puncture (LP) is a commonly performed medical procedure for a variety of indications. Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is usually performed if attempts at the bedside are unsuccessful. There is also an increasing trend to perform LP under fluoroscopy without prior bedside attempts, such as for patients who are obese or have a difficult anatomy because of a prior spine surgery . In addition to higher success rates, fluoroscopic guidance may reduce the incidence of traumatic LP .

Performing a successful FGLP requires a combination of anatomic knowledge and technical skill. Although the anatomic knowledge is typically gained through conventional didactic methods, acquiring the technical expertise traditionally requires performing the procedure on a patient under close supervision initially, followed by a gradual transition to independency. For a minimally invasive procedure such as FGLP, serious complications are fortunately rare (less than 0.5%) ; however, performance of the procedure by an inexperienced operator requiring multiple attempts can be associated with increased patient discomfort as well as an increase in minor complications . Although cadavers have historically been used for procedural training, they are associated with increased costs and limited availability due to logistic problems of procurement, storage, and disposal. An alternative approach is using a physical task trainer in the form of a mannequin that can be modified to suit the purpose of training for LP. However, these devices have limited durability, and it may not be practical or cost-effective to create or purchase multiple models as may be needed to represent different case difficulty levels. Also, utilizing a mannequin in a fluoroscopy room during the simulated procedure requires additional personnel exposure to radiation and resource utilization.

The stylus ( bottom right image ) is attached to a 3-D device, which provides varying tactile feedback as the needle traverses different tissues. The trainee also uses the foot pedal for fluoroscopy simulation ( bottom center ). The top right image shows a virtual fluoroscopy image and a 3-D image viewed on the screen by trainee, with user-adjusted transparency to reveal underlying osseous structures and where the needle tip is located. System feedback includes the number of inadvertent bone touches and accuracy with respect to the ideal target needle tip location.
