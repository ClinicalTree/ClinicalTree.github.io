## Rationale and Objectives

Mammography contributes to the improvement of breast carcinoma survival through early detection and treatment of breast lesions. The basal-like phenotype has been found to be an independent poor prognostic factor for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the mammographic correlates of the basal-like phenotype of invasive breast cancer, and to more precisely predict patient outcome and those individuals who will be responsive to a specific therapeutic regimen.

## Materials and Methods

The mammographic findings in 267 patients with operable breast cancer were correlated with the basal-like subtype identified using immunohistochemical assessment of breast cancer cases, including estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER-2/neu status, cytokeratin (CK5/6), and epidermal growth factor receptor.

## Results

Of the 267 invasive breast cancers, 40 (15%) were of the basal-like phenotype. Basal-phenotype tumors were significantly more likely to manifest as a mass ( _P_ = .002), most of which were indistinct margin ( _P =_ .035), at mammography, and architecture distortion at mammography ( _P_ = .002).

## Conclusion

The mammographic appearances of basal-like tumors, more mass and architecture distortion, suggest more rapid carcinogenesis. Additional studies are warranted to further refine prognosis, and to optimize treatment in patients with basal-like breast cancer.

Analysis of breast cancer tissue with DNA microarrays has categorized breast carcinoma into the following five distinct subtypes: luminal A (estrogen receptor \[ER\] positive and/or progesterone receptor \[PR\] positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 \[HER-2/neu) negative\], luminal B (ER positive and/or PR positive, HER-2/neu positive), HER-2/neu overexpression (ER negative, PR negative, HER-2/neu positive), basal-like (ER negative, PR negative, HER-2/neu negative, cytokeratin 5 and 6 \[CK5/6\] positive and/or epidermal growth factor receptor \[EGFR\] positive) and normal breast-like tumors. Although this classification system is based on extensive genetic profiling assays, a simplified method of classification (based on ER, PR, HER-2/neu, CK5/6, and EGFR status) is appealing and more clinically useful. The basal-like subtype is associated with aggressive histology, poor prognosis, unresponsiveness to the usual endocrine therapies, and shorter survival . The pathways that drive proliferation of these tumors are still poorly understood; however, after they have been elucidated, targeted agents can be developed, which could result in better outcomes for patients with basal-like tumors.

Several studies have attempted to evaluate and interpret the clinical perspective of the relationship between mammographic features and HER-2/neu overexpression in breast carcinomas, and shown that mammographic calcifications are correlated with HER-2/neu overexpression in breast carcinomas . Furthermore, the clinical perspective of the relationship between mammographic calcifications and the expression of selected biological markers, such as ER, PR, EGFR, Bax, Fas, Bcl-2, and DNA fragmentation factor in breast carcinomas have been interpreted .
