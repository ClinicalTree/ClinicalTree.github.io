## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of histogram analysis of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in differentiating indeterminate orbital malignant tumors from benign tumors, compared to using magnetic resonance (MR) morphological features alone.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 54 patients with orbital tumors from March 2013 to February 2015. All the patients were assessed by both routine MR and diffusion-weighted imaging, and divided into benign group and malignant group. Routine MR imaging features and histogram parameters derived from ADC maps, including mean ADC (ADC  mean ), median ADC (ADC  median ), standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and 10th and 90th percentiles of ADC (ADC  10 and ADC  90 ), were compared between two groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the most valuable variables in predicting malignancy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the diagnostic value of significant variables.

## Results

Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that two or more quadrants involved, iso-intense on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and ADC  10 were significant predictors for orbital malignancy. By using model 2 (iso-intense on T2WI + two or more quadrants involved + ADC  10 < 0.990) as the criterion, higher AUC and specificity could be achieved than by using model 1 (iso-intense on T2WI + two or more quadrants involved) alone, (model 2 vs model 1; area under curve (AUC), 0.827 vs 0.793; sensitivity, 65.4% vs 69.2%; specificity, 100% vs 89.3%).

## Conclusions

Iso-intense on T2WI, two or more quadrants involved, and ADC  10 are risk factors for orbital malignancy. Histogram analysis of ADC map might provide added value in predicting orbital malignancy.

## Introduction

Orbital space occupying lesions represent a broad spectrum of benign and malignant disease . Accurate differentiation of orbital benign and malignant tumors is very important for the pre-treatment plan . Although viewed as the gold standard, open or fine-needle aspiration biopsy is sometimes technically challenging or not feasible, especially for orbital apex lesions . Therefore, several previous imaging-related studies have tried to use the imaging features of routine computed tomography or magnetic resonance (MR) images to help differentiate malignant orbital tumors from benign mimics . Although some imaging features, including involvement of anterior orbit, irregular shape, ill-defined margin, and iso-intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), were indicated as potentially discriminating features for the malignant orbital tumors, their overall diagnostic performance was still limited.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been used increasingly to distinguish malignant orbital tumors from benign mimics . Although malignant orbital tumors usually show as high signal intensity on DWI and low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, the ADC value showed a substantial overlap between benign and malignant orbital tumors, which limited its clinical value for individual patients. Only the mean ADC value was used as the differentiating index in previous studies, which would underestimate the heterogeneity of the tumor, and might be the reason for the obvious overlap. Currently, histogram analysis of the ADC map based on pixel distribution has been proven useful to provide quantitative information about tumor heterogeneity, to differentiate and grade tumors, or to predict the treatment response in various organs . However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has applied the histogram analysis of ADC maps in differentiating benign and malignant orbital tumors.

Axial ( e ) and coronal ( f ) T2-weighted MR images demonstrate that the inflammatory pseudotumor lesion is shown as hyper-intense on T2-weighted images and involved two quadrants. The lymphoma lesion is shown as slightly hyper-intense on T2-weighted imaging and involve three quadrants. The pixel-by-pixel colored ADC maps ( c, g ) were obtained after selecting the ROI, and then embedded with the axial DWI.
