There are rapid changes occurring in the health care environment. Radiologists face new challenges but also new opportunities. The purpose of this report is to review how new informatics tools and developments can help the radiologist respond to the drive for safety, quality, and efficiency. These tools will be of assistance in conducting research and education. They not only provide greater efficiency in traditional operations but also open new pathways for the delivery of new services and imaging technologies. Our future as a specialty is dependent on integrating these informatics solutions into our daily practice.

The health care environment is undergoing rapid change, whether secondary to health care reform , natural organic changes, or accelerated technological advances. The economics of health care, changes in the demographics of our population, and the rapidly evolving socioeconomic environment all contribute to a world that presents the radiologist with new challenges. New models of health care, including accountable care organizations, are emerging . Our profession must adapt; the traditional approach to delivering imaging services may not be viable. Despite the challenges, there are new opportunities presenting themselves in parallel. There are new and exciting information technologies (ITs) to offer our patients that can contribute to improving their health and that can position our profession to better tackle the challenges that lie ahead.

We will argue that new informatics tools and developments can help the radiology profession respond to the drive for safety, quality and efficiency. New research realms, both clinical and molecular, require sophisticated informatics tools. The health of the individual and an emerging focus on population health require IT solutions. We will start with a description of some fundamental informatics building blocks and progress to explore new and rapidly evolving applications of interest to radiologists.

## A brief look backward

Radiology information systems (RIS) and picture archiving and communications systems (PACS), commonplace tools, are relatively recent developments. In 1983, the first American College of Radiology (ACR)–National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Committee met to develop the ACR-NEMA standard , first published in 1985. In 1993, the rapid rise in the number of digital modalities and the parallel development of robust networking technology prompted the development of digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) 3.0 .

Before RIS and PACS, consider how one viewed images, including cross-sectional exams of several hundred images. How were they displayed, archived, and moved about a department? We had film, dark rooms, light boxes, multichangers, and film libraries requiring numerous personnel. How were copies provided for consultation? How did clinicians see the exams they ordered? Historical exams were often stored off site and not available for days. Exams were often “borrowed” and out of circulation or out right lost. How did one manage an office or a department, schedule exams, and bill for one's services? These steps took place at a much slower pace than today.

Our new technologies have been “disruptive”. Certain jobs have disappeared (eg, file room clerks). The number of “schedulers” has usually diminished. The number of radiologists required to read a defined volume of exams has diminished, as PACs has resulted in increased productivity.

## Making CDS Operational

[Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article<](https://clinicalpub.com/app)

![Figure 1, The workflow (a,b) starts when a clinician enters an order for an imaging exam into the electronic medical record (EMR). In the past, the order would have been sent directly into a radiology information system (RIS) and scheduled. In the new workflow, the EMR first sends the order to another module or system, the radiology clinical decision support (CDS). Here, the order is evaluated to determine if it is appropriate, using a reference source such as the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. If the evaluation results in a high score, the order is sent directly to the RIS. If the order receives an intermediate or a low score, a message is returned to the EMR (c* or d*), indicating that this might not be the best choice. Alternative examinations may be suggested, and in some systems references may be provided. (c,d) Different styles of returning this information. The clinician may continue with the original order or choose one of the suggestions. MR, magnetic resonance; CT, computed tomography; MRA, MR angiography; CTA, CT angiography; IV, intravenous.

## Decision Support for the Radiologist

![Figure 2, There are a variety of tools that provide the radiologist with decision support. These include online search tools and point of service tools, integrated into the radiology reporting process. (a) myRSNA is a radiology portal hosted by the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). It offers a variety of services including a robust search function. One can bookmark references and even read some for continuing medical education credit online. (b) ARRS Goldminer offers a unique approach in searching. It has indexed the text of figure captions. It can search for terms included in the captions and brings back the figures, captions, and articles in which they are included. (c) This figure is taken from the interface of a voice recognition dictation product. It embeds a “wizard” to search terms on the fly. The user interface provides a list of the internet sites it has available to search. Some of these may require the user to have an additional license.

Each of these images is sent as part of a series to picture archiving and communications systems (PACS) (d) . If there are multiple axial images, they are included as a single series. A table (report) listing all the nodules is also sent as a series to PACS.

## Reporting the Metadata: AIM

[Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article<](https://clinicalpub.com/app)

[Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article<](https://clinicalpub.com/app)

![Figure 4, AIM (annotation and image markup) is a new tool to expose image metadata and make it accessible for a variety of applications. (a) Image metadata. This shows an example image and excerpts from the radiology report. The graphical symbols drawn by the radiologist on the image (“markups” indicating measurements of a lesion—quantitative data) and the statements in the report about the patient, type of exam, technique, date, imaging observations, and anatomic localization (semantic data) collectively comprise the image metadata (“annotation”). These image metadata, if stored in a standardized, machine-accessible format, greatly enable many computer applications to help radiologists in their daily work. (b) ePAD-rich Web client. The ePAD application provides a platform-independent and thin client implementation of an AIM-compliant image viewing workstation. Information about lesions that are marked up and reported by radiologists is captured and stored in AIM XML (or DICOM-SR [digital imaging and communications in medicine–structured report]). User-definable templates capture semantic information about lesions, such as shown in this case for oncology reporting, the type of lesion (target), anatomic location (liver), and type of imaging exam (baseline evaluation). (c) Radiology image information summarization application levering the utility of AIM-encoded image metadata. A cancer lesion–tracking application has queried AIM annotations created on different imaging studies (in this case, from three studies on April 3, June 6, and August 6, 2008). The application automatically calculates the sum of each target lesion measured on each imaging study date and summarizes the results in a table ( left ) and graph ( right ). Using metadata from the AIM annotations, the application also displays alternative response measures such as maximum length ( red line ) or cross-sectional area ( black line ) of the measured lesions.

![Figure 5, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) describes a series of profiles known as XDS or Cross Enterprise Document Sharing. There is a variant to accommodate the large files that comprise images, known as XDS-I. IHE describes sets of transactions based on common standards so that multiple parties can design systems that can easily interact—true interoperability. The XDS profiles describe a “document source,” where a piece of patient data is created, and a “document consumer,” which is the destination for the data when exchanging with a remote site. There are set of intermediaries that handle the exchange.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImagingInformatics/4_1s20S1076633213003358.jpg)
