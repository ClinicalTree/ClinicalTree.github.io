## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of our study was to classify breast density using areometric and volumetric automatic measurements to best match Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density scores, and determine which technique best agrees with BI-RADS. Second, this study aimed to provide a set of threshold values for areometric and volumetric density to estimate BI-RADS categories.

## Materials and Methods

We randomly selected 537 full-field digital mammography examinations from a population-based screening program. Five radiologists assessed breast density using BI-RADS with all views available. A commercial program calculated areometric and volumetric breast density automatically. We compared automatically calculated density to all BI-RADS density thresholds using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and used Youden's index to estimate thresholds in automatic densities, with matching sensitivity and specificity. The 95% confidence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping.

## Results

Areometric density correlated well with volumetric density (r  2 = 0.76, excluding outliers, _n_ = 2). For the BI-RADS threshold between II and III, areometric and volumetric assessment showed about equal area under the curve (0.94 vs. 0.93). For the threshold between I and II, areometric assessment was better than volumetric assessment (0.91 vs. 0.86). For the threshold between III and IV, volumetric assessment was better than areometric assessment (0.97 vs. 0.92).

## Conclusions

Volumetric assessment is equal to or better than areometric assessment for the most clinically relevant thresholds (ie, between scattered fibroglandular and heterogeneously dense, and between heterogeneously dense and extremely dense breasts). Thresholds found in this study can be applied in daily practice to automatic measurements of density to estimate BI-RADS classification.

## Introduction

Dense tissue can mask breast cancer , reducing the effect of mammography screening . Further, women with dense breasts have increased breast cancer risk . Thus, some countries have breast density assessment included in the mammography screening programs. In several US states, women with dense breasts (American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System \[BI-RADS\] density III and IV) will by law be informed about the higher breast cancer risk and the possibility of dense tissue masking a cancer . Austria offers women with dense breasts adjunctive ultrasound in their screening program .

Several methods for breast density classification exist . Radiologist assessment using the semiquantitative BI-RADS density scale is the most common . The BI-RADS system introduced this method mainly to quantify radiologists' concern of missing cancers because of dense breast tissue . Thus, association between breast density and diagnostic efficacy of mammography is mostly based on this scale. A major disadvantage of BI-RADS assessment is its interobserver variability . Therefore, in a personalized screening setting, a woman's screening routine would be dependent on the radiologist's subjective opinion of breast density.
