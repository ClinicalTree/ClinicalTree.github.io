## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) in groups of patients with low, intermediate, and high risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) events.

## Materials and Methods

The institutional review board approved this study; written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Eighty-eight consecutive patients with suspected CAD (40 women; mean age, 64.3 ± 9.4 years; range, 39–82) underwent CTCA, calcium scoring, and invasive coronary angiography and were grouped according to their Framingham 10-year risk for hard coronary events into low (<10%), intermediate (10%–20%), and high (>20%) risk categories. Significant stenoses (luminal diameter narrowing ≥50%) were assessed on an intention-to-diagnose-basis; no coronary segment was excluded and nonevaluative segments were rated false positive. To determine differences between groups, Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed for individually determined values of diagnostic performance.

## Results

Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive, and positive predictive values were 90.0%, 79.2%, 95.0%, and 64.3%, respectively, with low (n = 34), 87.5%, 92.3%, 85.7%, and 93.3%, respecitively, with intermediate (n = 29), and 100%, 75.0%, 100%, and 89.5%, respectively, with high risk (n = 25), with a trend toward higher positive predictive value ( _P_ = .07). Per-segment negative predictive value was lower with high pretest probability ( _P_ < .01). Mean calcium-score units were 90, 220, and 312 ( _P_ = .23), and the prevalence of CAD was 29.4%, 55.2%, and 68.0% ( _P_ < .01) with low, intermediate, and high risk.

## Conclusion

Sensitivity and specificity of CTCA are not influenced by the prevalence of CAD, whereas the negative predictive value is lower and the positive predictive value tends to be higher in patients with a high prevalence of CAD.

Sixty-four–slice computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be a reliable noninvasive tool to document or rule out significant coronary artery lesions ( ). In particular, the high negative predictive value (NPV) of CT coronary angiography (CTCA), demonstrated in all studies ( ), has been suggested to obviate the need for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in patients whose symptoms or abnormal stress test results require ruling out the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) ( ). Although some guidelines ( ) allow consideration of CTCA in patients with a low pretest probability, others have suggested CTCA as an appropriate tool in patients with an intermediate risk for CAD ( ). In high pretest populations, CTCA is not considered a useful tool, because the likelihood for the necessity of a subsequent ICA is high.

However, most studies that determined the diagnostic accuracy of 64-slice CTCA have included patients with known CAD ( ) and patient cohorts with high prevalences of CAD (56%–85%) ( ), not taking into account the pretest probability or the risk to develop coronary events in those patients with suspected CAD ( ).
