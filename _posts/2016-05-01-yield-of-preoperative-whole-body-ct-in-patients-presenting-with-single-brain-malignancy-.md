## Rationale and Objectives

Single brain malignancy (SBM) often poses a diagnostic dilemma, with differential diagnosis of primary brain malignancy (PBM) versus metastasis commonly rendered. This study assesses the yield of preoperative computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CTCAP) in patients with SBM.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board (IRB)-approved retrospective review of the imaging database at a tertiary-care center was performed for patients with magnetic resonance findings compatible with a diagnosis of SBM. Demographic information, lesion characteristics (location and size), and pathology were recorded. Findings of CTCAP for metastatic workup prior to SBM excisional biopsy were also documented, if performed.

## Results

Eighty-six of 92 patients with new diagnosis of SBM on MR imaging had subsequent lesion resection and pathology consistent with malignancy. PBM accounted for 51 cases (59%) and metastasis accounted for 35 cases (41%). When stratified by age group, PBM was more common in patients <50 years old (15 of 18 (83%)), whereas similar rates of PBM and metastatic disease were identified in older patients. When stratified by lesion size, PBM was more common in tumors ≥40 mm (25 of 31 (81%)), whereas similar rates of PBM and metastatic disease were identified in smaller lesions. Lung cancer was the most common CTCAP and pathology-confirmed source of metastatic SBM (68% and 66%, respectively).

## Conclusions

The yield of preoperative CTCAP can be increased by targeting patients older than 50 years of age with SBMs smaller than 40 mm in size.

## Introduction

Primary brain malignancy is relatively common, with an expected incidence of 25,000 cases in 2016 according to the Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States . Brain metastases are even more common than primary brain malignancy, with an estimated yearly incidence of 40,000 cases . Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging test of choice for detecting and characterizing brain tumors, and a normal contrast-enhanced MRI essentially rules out malignancy. Multiple ring enhancing neoplasms in the brain are usually metastases and do not cause a diagnostic dilemma. However, single enhancing neoplasms often pose a challenge as both primary intra-axial tumor and solitary metastasis may have a similar appearance. This becomes even more problematic given the similar rates of primary and metastatic malignancies in the setting of single brain malignancies (SBMs), specifically . Further adding to the confusion, approximately half of all brain metastases are single , and about 70% of all patients with brain metastases have three or fewer lesions at the time of detection . Several findings at routine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have been described to attempt to distinguish between the two entities , but commonly a differential diagnosis of primary brain malignancy versus metastasis is still rendered, precipitating our clinical colleagues to pursue computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CTCAP) prior to SBM excisional biopsy in search of a potential extracranial primary malignancy. Our goal is to characterize the yield of preoperative CTCAP in patients with SBM diagnosed on imaging.

## Methods

## Subjects

Following IRB approval, a retrospective review of an imaging database at a tertiary-care center was performed for patients with a new diagnosis of a single brain lesion suspicious for malignancy found on brain imaging. The time period of data collection was from 2008 to 2013. The search terms used were “single, solitary, brain, malignancy, metastasis, primary.” Only positive cases were reviewed. The search engine used was Primordial (Primordial Inc, San Mateo, CA). MR imaging of the brain was the imaging modality used to assess for SBM due to its ability to detect small lesions: additional lesions can be occult on enhanced and unenhanced CT. MR also provides increased specificity for diagnosis of brain malignancy, by distinguishing between other potential etiologies, such as brain abscesses (which typically show restricted diffusion centrally, arguing against malignancy) . Only patients with single brain neoplasms who had a subsequent lesion resection confirming malignancy (primary or metastatic) were included in this study. Patient demographic information (sex, age), lesion MR characteristics (location, size, signal characteristics), and pathology results were recorded. Findings of CTCAP for preoperative metastatic workup were also documented, if performed. The majority of the CTCAPs were performed within 24 hours, and all were performed within 3 days (before SBM excisional biopsy was attempted). Exemplar brain MR and body CT imaging are provided in  Figures 1 and 2 .
