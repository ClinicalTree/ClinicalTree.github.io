This is when radiology expands in size, accepts new technology, stimulates potential diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and distinctions that foster the future of radiology as it peaks 118Â years of the growth of its efforts.

Back in 1995, patrons of medical radiology celebrated a centennial year from the time, in November 1895, that Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, the German physicist, discovered that he and other physicists realized that their experimentation about electric currents in glass vacuum tubes emitted invisible rays that emerged from the vacuum tubes and penetrated across a laboratory room. Roentgen discovered that the electric energy would expose a fluorescent screen, make a shadow of objects between the tube and the screen, or expose a photographic plate. When he held his hand between the tube and the plate, his flesh disappeared and his bones appeared on the screen or in a photograph. It was only about a couple of more years before Roentgen explored with x-rays. He got a Nobel Prize for his triumph.

In 1896, American scientists exploring Roentgen's technique published more than 1000 articles in scientific publications. New companies in Europe and North America modified x-ray devices and effective film elements.

Curious doctors who used x-rays to diagnose patient problems and to treat small cancers also suffered x-ray exposures because the Roentgen type x-ray machines lacked any serious protection. But then, the incredible x-ray machine developed in 1913 by William Coolidge, a General Electric Company scientist, provided shelters for both diagnostic and treatment x-ray applications.

In the mid 1920s, the American Roentgen Ray Society encouraged the US Bureau of Standards to help devise linkage for the measurement of radiation exposures. In the 1928 International Congress of Radiology in Stockholm, Sweden, two international societies were organized to develop radiation measurement technology and schemes for radiation protection in its uses for medicine. In 1929, the US Bureau of Standards sponsored creation for the National Council of Radiation Protection and Measurement, which has grown ever since then.

In those early decades, doctors who wanted to choose radiology lacked no formal training programs for the new discipline. Some young doctors attempted to spend time in academic radiology sections, at Harvard in Boston, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and others in Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, and some of the growing medical clinics. It was not until 1934 that radiology societies linked to form the American Board of Radiology. The ABR was the fifth certifying board of a determined radiology discipline. The ABR certified several hundred self-styled radiologists, examined many others, and developed patterns for training young, ambitious doctors.
