## Rationale and Objectives

Discrepancy rates for interpretations produced in a call situation are one metric to evaluate residents during training. Current benchmarks, reported in previous studies, do not consider the effects of practice pattern variability among attending radiologists. This study aims to investigate the impact of attending variability on resident discrepancy rates to determine if the current benchmarks are an accurate measure of resident performance and, if necessary, update discrepancy benchmarks to accurately identify residents performing below expectations.

## Materials and Methods

All chest radiographs, musculoskeletal (MSK) radiographs, chest computed tomographies (CTs), abdomen and pelvis CTs, and head CTs interpreted by postgraduate year-3 residents in a call situation over 5 years were reviewed for the presence of a significant discrepancy and composite results compared to prior findings. Simulations of the expected discrepancy distribution for an “average resident” were then performed using Gibbs sampling, and this distribution was compared to the actual resident distribution.

## Results

A strong inverse correlation between resident volume and discrepancy rates was found. There was wide variability among attendings in both overread volume and propensity to issue a discrepancy, although there was no significant correlation. Simulations show that previous benchmarks match well for chest radiographs, abdomen and pelvis CTs, and head CTs but not for MSK radiographs and chest CTs. The simulations also demonstrate a large effect of attending practice patterns on resident discrepancy rates.

## Conclusions

The large variability in attending practice patterns suggests direct comparison of residents using discrepancy rates is unlikely to reflect true performance. Current benchmarks for chest radiographs, abdomen and pelvis CTs, and head CTs are appropriate and correctly flag residents whose performance may benefit from additional attention, whereas those for MSK radiographs and chest CTs are likely too strict.

## Introduction

There is increasing use of metrics to demonstrate competency and measure performance of trainees across all specialties of medicine . Within radiology, discrepancy rates for study interpretations made in call situations, without immediate attending input or oversight, are commonly incorporated into resident feedback . This feedback may be occasional, in the form of missed case conferences or a semiannual meeting with the program director, or in near real-time implemented in a dashboard that residents can access via a web interface .

Many radiology residency programs calculate on-call discrepancy rates of trainees to understand trainee performance . At our institution, a previous study investigated the distribution of individual discrepancy rates across all residents . Although many factors contribute to trainee discrepancies, rates greater than anticipated, falling above 1.5% for radiographs and 4.0% for computed tomographies (CTs) (approximately two standard deviations above the mean), are considered outliers and indicate the potential need for intervention to ensure the resident performs at a level adequate for training . These values are in line with discrepancy rates reported elsewhere . To ensure adequate sampling of an individual resident, the cutoffs were applied only after residents had interpreted greater than 200 radiographs and 50 CTs in total.
