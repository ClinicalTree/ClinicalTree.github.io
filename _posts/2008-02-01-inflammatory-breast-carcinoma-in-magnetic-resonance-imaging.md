## Rationale and Objectives

Although inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) accounts for 1%–4% of all breast cancer cases, the appearance of this highly malignant tumor in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still not well characterized. The aim of this study was to identify typical imaging features of IBC in comparison with noninflammatory locally advanced breast carcinoma (LABC).

## Materials and Methods

MRIs of 48 patients with IBC were compared with an equivalent cohort of 52 subjects with LABC. Age and histopathologic subtype were equivalent between the two groups. To delineate characteristic features, a multitude of dynamic and morphologic parameters were evaluated using T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

## Results

No significant differences of prevalences could be found for the following criteria: dynamic tumor signal characteristics, prominent vessels, perifocal edema, axillary lymph node involvement, morphology of focal masses, and morphologic pattern of non–mass like enhancement. Otherwise, the quantity of focal masses and the spatial distribution of the tumoral infiltration significantly differed between the two cancer groups. The following parameters occurred more frequently in the IBC cases: edema (cutaneous/subcutaneous 81.3%, perimamillar 70.8%, diffuse 89.6%, prepectoral 72.9%, intramuscular pectoral 41.7%), thickening (75.0%) and pathologic enhancement (60.4%) of Cooper’s ligaments, skin thickening (83.3%), punched-out sign (initially strong, focal increase of some dermal or subcutaneous parts followed by slow-continuous enhancement of the surrounding skin; 56.3%).

## Conclusions

Inflammatory breast carcinoma seems to represent a specific biological entity resulting in typical MRI characteristics. Some of the parameters are supposed to visualize the characteristic extensive lymphovascular infiltration and therefore may improve the diagnosis of IBC.

Inflammatory breast carcinoma (IBC) is a very malignant form of invasive breast cancer with a tendency to metastasize at an early stage, resulting in a poor outcome ( ). This aggressive variant accounts for about 1%–4% of all breast cancer cases with an increasing incidence rate, probably because of changing patterns of risk factor exposure ( ). The term _inflammatory carcinoma_ derives from the inflammatory-like symptoms that are associated with this cancer type; typical clinical manifestations are increased volume and induration of the breast, pain, peau d’orange appearance, increased cutaneous temperature, dermal redness of at least one-third of the breast, and the presence of a palpable mass ( ).

The clinical manifestations of IBC are histologically related to dermal or subcutaneous lymphatic infiltration by tumor emboli that obstruct the lymphatic capillaries ( ). However, lymphatic infiltration of the skin cannot be detected by histology in all patients suffering from IBC. Thus, inflammatory breast carcinoma comprises the following subtypes ( ): the presence of both clinical symptoms of inflammation and dermal or subcutaneous lymphatic tumoral invasion verified by histology, accounts for about 50% and is known as _common IBC_ . A further 40% is only characterized by the appearance of clinical signs in the absence of histopathologically verified lymphatic infiltration and is consecutively named _clinical IBC_ . A small proportion of cases, about 10%, do not present any clinical inflammatory signs, and the diagnosis is only made by lymphatic invasion of the skin, the so-called _occult IBC_ . This occult inflammatory carcinoma is proved to show a better prognosis than the other two types and may therefore be an early IBC form ( ).

The craniocaudal **(a)** and mediolateral-oblique **(b)** mammogram demonstrates a diffuse increase of breast density and skin thickening. The magnetic resonance examination ( **c:** subtraction 1 minute after bolus injection; **d:** T2-weighted image) shows the tumor characteristics in much more detail: the diffuse enhancement infiltrating the skin and the pectoralis muscle (continuous arrows), and edema in a cutaneous/subcutaneous, diffuse, and prepectoral localization (discontinuous arrows).
