## Rational and Objectives

Microwave ablation is an alternative therapy with high cost-effectiveness for liver malignancy. The authors designed this experiment to compare the effect of microwave ablation using a non-internally cooled (NIC) antenna with that using an internally cooled (IC) antenna in both an ex vivo and an in vivo liver models.

## Materials and Methods

Sixty-two microwave ablations were performed in ex vivo porcine and in vivo canine liver models (NIC antenna, 28 coagulations; IC antenna, 34 coagulations). Pair comparisons were executed in terms of the coagulation parameters, including short-axis diameter (SD), long-axis diameter (LD), and spherical ratio (SR, SD/LD). The distributions of tissue temperatures were compared in ex vivo ablation. During in vivo ablation, the temperatures of antenna shaft were measured and unintended tissue coagulation were observed and compared.

## Results

In both ex vivo and in vivo ablations, less charring areas were found around the IC antenna shaft. With a longer SD ( _P_ < .01) and a shorter LD ( _P_ < .01), the coagulations of IC antenna appeared to be more spherical than those of NIC antenna ( _P_ < .01). During ablations in vivo, the temperatures of NIC antennas shaft were up to 90°C or even higher, which resulted in some unintended tissue coagulation, whereas the temperatures of IC antennas shaft were lower than 20°C in all ablation processes without any unintended tissue coagulation ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusion

The IC antenna performed better than NIC antenna in microwave ablation for liver models and might be more suitable for therapy for liver malignancy in clinical practice.

Thermal ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency (RF) and microwave ablation , have been widely used as minimally invasive strategies to treat liver malignant tumors. So far, among all the thermal ablation modalities, RF is the most commonly modality adopted and reported, and significant advances have been work out recently, such as the use of multiprobe , multitined expandable , internally cooled (IC) , and perfusion RF electrodes . Microwave ablation, as a minimally invasive and high cost-effective modality, has been mainly used in Asia . RF ablation and microwave ablation have equivalent therapeutic effects, complication rates, local recurrence rates, and residual cancer rates. However, RF tumor ablation can be achieved with fewer sessions than microwave ablation, which may be attributed to the limitation of the small extent of coagulation necrosis produced with a single microwave application.

Theoretically, microwave ablation is more efficient than RF ablation because microwaves can penetrate more deeply than RF waves do and the delivery of microwave energy depends less on tissue texture and impedance . Microwave ablations were reported to be less affected by the heat-sink effect, which was believed to result in local recurrence . Recently, microwave ablation effect has been improved with the advent of triaxial antennas , loop antenna , and IC antenna . The IC antenna might be a promising one because it could increase microwave delivery, enlarge the ablation zone, and minimize collateral damages such as skin burn .
