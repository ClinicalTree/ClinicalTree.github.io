## Rationale and Objectives

We tested whether satisfaction of search (SOS) effects that occur in computed tomography (CT) examination of the chest on detection of native abnormalities are produced by the addition of simulated pulmonary nodules.

## Materials and Methods

Two experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, 70 CT examinations, half that demonstrated diverse, subtle abnormalities and half that demonstrated no native lesions, were read by 18 radiology residents and fellows under two experimental conditions: presented with and without pulmonary nodules. In a second experiment, many of the examinations were replaced to include more salient native abnormalities. This set was read by 14 additional radiology residents and fellows. In both experiments, detection of the natural abnormalities was studied. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve areas for each reader-treatment combination were estimated using empirical and proper ROC models. Additional analyses focused on decision thresholds and visual search time on abnormality-free CT slice ranges. Institutional review board approval and informed consent from 32 participants were obtained.

## Results

Observers more often missed diverse native abnormalities when pulmonary nodules were added, but also made fewer false-positive responses. There was no change in ROC area, but decision criteria grew more conservative. The SOS effect on decision thresholds was accompanied by a reduction in search time on abnormality-free CT slice ranges.

## Conclusion

The SOS effect in CT examination of the chest is similar to that found in contrast examination of the abdomen, involving induced visual neglect.

> “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.” —Herbert A. Simon

The left panel shows a pulmonary nodule (indicated by the white box ) which was present in slices 121–127 of the computed tomography (CT) examination in the satisfaction of search (SOS) experimental condition, but was not present in the CT examination in the non-SOS control condition. The right panel shows the test abnormality (indicated by the white box ), an example of aortic dilatation, which was visible in slices 67–99 of the CT examination in both experimental conditions.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SatisfactionofSearchfromDetectionofPulmonaryNodulesinComputedTomographyoftheChest/0_1s20S1076633212004801.jpg)

![Figure 2, Plot of receiver operating characteristic points for detecting test abnormalities, diverse subtle abnormalities, from two experiments. Experiment 1 points are black triangles representing the non-SOS condition and white triangles representing the SOS condition. Experiment 2 points are black circles representing the non-SOS condition and white circles representing the SOS condition. Clearly, experiment 2 achieved more accurate detection than did experiment 1. Both experiments show a shift in decision thresholds toward greater strictness in the SOS condition with fewer true positives and fewer false positives. This decision threshold shift is indicative of less visual search.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SatisfactionofSearchfromDetectionofPulmonaryNodulesinComputedTomographyoftheChest/1_1s20S1076633212004801.jpg)
