## Rationale and Objectives

Image distortion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate in 3T endorectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations is common. The aim of this study was to determine the degree of distortion on DWI using a state-of-the-art clinical protocol and to explore the main contributors to geometric distortion.

## Materials and Methods

Forty consecutive patients underwent 3T MRI of the prostate with an endorectal coil filled with air ( _n_ = 20) or barium sulfate ( _n_ = 20). Distortion was measured as the maximum displacement of the outer boundary of the prostate on DWI relative to T2-weighted imaging. The effects of phase-encoding direction, receiver bandwidth, and parallel imaging were then assessed in a prostate phantom on two MRI scanners from different manufacturers.

## Results

There was no statistical difference in the mean displacement of the prostate on DWI between the air cohort (1.8 ± 1.2 mm, range 0–4.2 mm) and barium cohort (1.8 ± 2.2 mm, range 0–9 mm). Displacement of the prostate was observed in the phase-encoding direction. Phantom experiments demonstrated a horizontal displacement of 6.0 mm in the phase-encoding direction, which decreased with the use of parallel imaging and higher bandwidth. Geometric distortion was similar for all _b_ values and across manufacturers.

## Conclusions

Geometric distortion on DWI of the prostate is common in the phase-encoding direction and does not improve with inflating the coil with barium sulfate. Strategies to reduce this artifact include the use of higher bandwidth and accelerated imaging. Correction of this phenomenon should improve localization of prostate cancer, particularly important for targeted prostate biopsies or focal therapies.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has become a key component of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate . Although DWI improves prostate cancer detection and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values derived from these acquisitions seem to correlate with tumor grade potentially predicting disease aggressiveness, this technique is prone to image distortion .

DWI relies on multiple acquisitions, probing the rate with which water diffuses in various directions and over different scales. Although single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SE-EPI) is very sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities, such as those caused by air in the rectum or within the endorectal coil (ERC) near the prostate , it is the most commonly used sequence in DWI. With SE-EPI, phase error accumulation results in voxel shifts that distort the image along the phase-encoding direction . New gradient coils capable of extremely fast linear gradient switches have enabled DWI acquisition with higher spatial resolution. However, increasing the resolution results in longer echo trains and further increases the accumulation of errors during the spatial encoding .

![Figure 6, Geometric distortion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in a phantom model occurs in the phase-encoding axis and direction. (a) T2-FSE image (TR, 8 seconds; TE, 120 milliseconds; flip angle, 90°) served as anatomic reference for the contour of the prostate ( green ); when the phase-encoding direction on DWI was shifted from right-to-left axis (TR, 10 seconds; TE, 99 milliseconds; flip angle, 90°; b–c) to the anterior-to-posterior axis (TR, 10 seconds; TE, 97 milliseconds; flip angle, 90°; d–e) , the axis of the distortion consistently followed the phase-encoding direction. This effect can also be inferred by assessing the shape of the signal void in the endorectal balloon and the outer contour of the phantom. When the fat-shift direction was inverted, the distortion orientation was inverted ( b , fat-shift left; c , fat-shift right; d , fat-shift posterior; and e , fat-shift anterior).

where _γ_ is the gyromagnetic ratio, Δ _B_ is the perturbation of the _B_ 0 field, and FOV  y and BW  y are the field of view and bandwidth, respectively. From this formula, we can conclude that the voxel shift in the phase-encoding direction will be inversely proportional to the effective bandwidth per voxel, which is consistent with our findings in the phantom: distortion was reduced using a higher bandwidth without altering any other acquisition parameter.
