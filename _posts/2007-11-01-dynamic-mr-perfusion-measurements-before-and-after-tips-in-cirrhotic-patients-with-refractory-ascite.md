## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to assess changes in liver perfusion parameters induced by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites using dynamic MR perfusion measurements.

## Materials and Methods

MR perfusion measurements were performed before and after TIPS creation in 15 cirrhotic patients all with refractory ascites. Measurements were performed over a time period of 120 seconds providing 60 images for each examination and calculations were done in both liver and splenic parenchyma. Different perfusion parameters were assessed: time to peak (TTP), time to inflow deceleration (TID), maximal or peak perfusion (C-peak) and the wash-in rate.

## Results

TIPS procedures were successful in all 15 patients but were complicated by hepatic encephalopathy in 3 patients (20%), and in another 4 patients (26%), persistent refractory ascites was still noted during follow-up. Overall, liver TID values decreased significantly ( _P_ = .001) after TIPS creation; liver wash-in values increased significantly ( _P_ = .04) after TIPS. TTP values did not decrease significantly ( _P_ = .16) and liver C-peak values did not change equally ( _P_ = .99).

## Conclusion

In cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, TIPS induced a faster, but not an increased, contrast enhancement in the liver.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has become an accepted interventional treatment modality for portal hypertension−related complications such as variceal bleeding and refractory ascites ( ). Symptomatic relief and survival after TIPS creation mainly depend on residual liver function and shunt (dys)function. The latter problem has become marginal owing to the introduction of e-PTFE−covered endoprostheses ( ), but clinical response and even survival after TIPS, especially in ascitic patients with a poor liver function, remain unpredictable. Several scoring and classification systems were designed to better select patients for TIPS and to better predict outcome after TIPS. Most of them, like the Child-Pugh classification or the MELD score ( ), are based on clinical and biochemical parameters. Although clinically useful, these scoring systems are not unfailing, and some patients presenting with an acceptable score may not respond to the shunt procedure, and vice versa. Recently, some imaging studies were performed on patients before TIPS creation in order to predict survival after TIPS placement based on flow velocity measurements in the hepatic artery ( ) and on liver perfusion parameters, especially in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites ( ). According to Walser et al. ( ), blunted arterial-type hepatic enhancement significantly lower than renal enhancement seems to be predictive for poor clinical outcome after TIPS. The aim of this study is to evaluate, by dynamic MR imaging, perfusion parameters of the liver and spleen before and after TIPS placement in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Additionally, we aim to assess the potential of these MR imaging parameters for prediction of clinical response before TIPS placement.

## Materials and methods

## Patient Population

Fifteen patients (13 male and 2 female; mean age, 52.5 years; age range, 36–69 years) underwent a TIPS procedure to treat portal hypertension-related ascites refractory to conservative medical therapy. In four patients (26%), an additional hepatic hydrothorax was noted. The underlying liver disease was cirrhosis owing to alcohol abuse (n = 12), hepatitis C infection (n = 1), and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (n = 2). Assessment of Child-Pugh score was performed: Child-Pugh A (n = 1), Child-Pugh B (n = 7), and Child-Pugh C (n = 7). All included patients had a Child-Pugh score equal to or less than 12 points.
