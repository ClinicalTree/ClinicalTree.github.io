## Rationale and Objectives

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic neurocutaneous syndrome in which cognitive and social-behavioral outcomes for patients vary widely in an unpredictable manner. The cause of adverse neurologic outcome remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that disordered white matter and abnormal neural connectivity are associated with adverse neurologic outcomes.

## Materials and Methods

Structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 40 subjects with TSC (age range, 0.5–25 years; mean age, 7.2 years; median age, 5 years), 12 of whom had autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and in 29 age-matched controls. Tractography of the corpus callosum was used to define a three-dimensional volume of interest. Regional averages of four diffusion scalar parameters of the callosal projections were calculated for each subject. These were the average fractional anisotropy (AFA) and the average mean, radial, and axial diffusivity.

## Results

Subjects with TSC had significantly lower AFA and higher average mean, radial, and axial diffusivity values compared to controls. Subjects with TSC and ASD had significantly lower AFA values compared to those without ASD and compared to controls. Subjects with TSC without ASD had similar AFA values compared to controls.

## Conclusion

Diffusion tensor scalar parameters provided measures of properties of the three-dimensional callosal projections. In TSC, changes in these parameters may reflect microstructural changes in myelination, axonal integrity, or extracellular environment. Alterations in white matter microstructural properties were associated with TSC, and larger changes were associated with TSC and ASD, thus establishing a relationship between altered white matter microstructural integrity and brain function.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic neurocutaneous syndrome with an estimated incidence of one in 6000 to 10,000. Although some patients with TSC may never show neurologic symptoms affecting their quality of life, epilepsy occurs in 80% to 90% of all patients, close to 45% of patients have mild to profound intellectual disabilities, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) occur in up to 50% of patients .

The cause of neurologic deficits in patients with TSC is a key unresolved question, and neurologic outcomes remains highly variable and unpredictable. It has been hypothesized that tubers disrupt local cerebral architecture, resulting in impaired brain function. However, no robust conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measure of tubers correlates consistently with the clinical phenotype or long-term neurologic outcomes , and neither a high tuber load nor tubers in specific locations are necessary or sufficient to predict seizures, cognitive impairment, or autism .

The new point _p  k_ +1 is tested to ensure that it is inside the image boundary and inside the region to be considered for tractography. A mask can be used to ensure that tractography does not step through regions with no white matter. Streamline generation is terminated if points are not validated. Streamline termination criteria related to the FA and angle changes are then checked.

where FA( _D  k_ +1 ) is the FA of the tensor _D  k_ +1 . The primary eigenvector of the tensor is computed, providing _e  k_ +1 . The angle criterion is assessed by accumulating the cosine of trajectory angle changes, :

The new direction of the streamline is calculated using a combination of the primary eigenvector and tensor deflection, while accounting for the previous direction of the streamline:

Propagation of each streamline was terminated if the trajectory FA fell below 0.15 or if the tract trajectory angle exceeded 30°. The trajectories were obtained using the step size parameter _s_ = 0.33 mm, α = 0.5, β = 0.5, γ = 0.5, δ = 0.5, and tensor deflection power ϵ = 2.
