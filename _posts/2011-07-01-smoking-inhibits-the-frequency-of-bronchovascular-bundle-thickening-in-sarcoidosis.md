## Rationale/Objectives

Smoking has been associated with decreased incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis, but few studies have evaluated effects of smoking on clinical parameters of the disease. The objectives were to determine the association of smoking with radiographic patterns and to evaluate the associations of these smoking-related radiographic patterns on airflow obstruction in sarcoidosis.

## Materials and Methods

Clinical data and computed tomography (CT) scans of 124 patients with sarcoidosis were reviewed. CT scans were assessed for lymph nodes, nodules, bronchiectasis, bronchovascular bundle thickening, displaced hilum, fibrosis, ground glass, emphysema, pleural changes, and alveolar opacities. CT patterns were compared between patients with and without a history of smoking. The effect of smoking on the associations between radiographic patterns and airflow obstruction was assessed with multivariable analysis.

## Results

Smokers had less frequency of bronchovascular bundle thickening than nonsmokers (11/38 subjects \[29%\] vs 50/86 subjects \[58%\], _P_ = .003) and more emphysema (7/38 subjects \[18%\] vs 1/86 subjects \[1%\], _P_ = .001). Patients who had bronchovascular bundle thickening were less likely to have ever smoked (11/61 subjects \[18%\] vs 27/63 subjects \[43%\], _P_ = .003) or be current smokers (4/61 subjects \[7%\] vs 15/63 subjects \[24%\], _P_ = .008). Age ( _P_ = .003) and bronchovascular bundle thickening ( _P_ = .02) were independent predictors of airflow obstruction. There were no differences in smoking history between patients with airflow obstruction versus those without (10/37 subjects \[27%\] vs 28/87 subjects \[32%\], _P_ = .63).

## Conclusions

In patients with sarcoidosis, smoking is associated with decreased frequency of bronchovascular bundle thickening, an important clinical manifestation of the lung disease. Further, bronchovascular bundle thickening and age are the only independent predictors of airflow obstruction, and smoking does not confound these associations.

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology predominately affecting the lungs. Noncaseating granulomas are the hallmark of the disease and can cause decreased pulmonary function, impairment of gas exchange, and fibrosis of lung parenchyma. The natural history of the disease is not completely understood, adding complexity to clinical management and treatment . Thus, further study of clinical parameters is warranted.

Multiple epidemiologic studies have found smoking to be associated with decreased incidence and prevalence of the disease . A case control etiologic study of sarcoidosis (ACCESS) showed that smoking subjects were less likely to have sarcoidosis (OR 0.62, CI 0.5–0.77), and Visser et al found that patients presenting with sarcoid arthritis were much less likely to be smoking (OR 0.09, CI 0.02–0.37) . However, there are few studies that have evaluated the effect of smoking on patients who have sarcoidosis. For instance, two descriptive studies of sarcoidosis populations have not indicated that smoking affects progression or severity of disease or that smoking prevents respiratory failure in this group . The mechanisms behind this paradoxical phenomenon (decreased incidence, but no effect on disease severity) are unclear, and the question of how smoking has an overall effect on sarcoidosis remains unanswered.
