Medical knowledge and the volume of scientific articles published have expanded rapidly over the past 50 years. Evidence-based practice (EBP) has developed to help health practitioners get more benefit from the increasing volume of information to solve complex health problems. A format for sharing information in EBP is the critically appraised topic (CAT). A CAT is a standardized summary of research evidence organized around a clinical question, aimed at providing both a critique of the research and a statement of the clinical relevance of results. In this review, we explain the five steps involved in writing a CAT for a clinical purpose (“Ask,” “Search,” “Appraise,” “Apply,” and “Evaluate”) and introduce some of the useful electronic resources available to help in creating CATs.

Medical knowledge has expanded rapidly over the past 50 years. Many subcategories of disease, diagnostic testing, and treatment strategies are now known. Paralleling this improvement in medicine, the volume of scientific articles published has exploded and is doubling every 10 years . Therefore, evidence-based practice (EBP) and publications in this area have developed to help health practitioners keep up to date with the increasing volume of information to solve complex health problems .

One of the main formats for sharing information in EBP is the critically appraised topic (CAT). A CAT is a standardized summary of research evidence organized around a clinical question, aimed at providing both a critique of the research and a statement of the clinical relevance of results . In other words, CATs are not just abstracts of existing evidence. They critique the internal validity, external validity (generalizability), and statistical rigor (or methodology) of the best research evidence to date and summarize the results into a few pages . In contrast to systematic reviews, which are written by content and methodology experts, CATs may be more easily written by clinicians and practitioners . Critically appraised topics provide easy access to the scientific literature for clinicians who are either too busy to pursue the answer to a clinical problem among the mixed results from a search engine or do not have the specialized skill to critically appraise the literature and reach an appropriate conclusion . The main reason to produce a CAT is to answer an explicit clinical question arising from a specific patient encounter, and is the essence of EBP in that a health professional generates a clinical question from a real clinical situation, followed by finding and appraising the evidence, and finally applying it in clinical practice .

In this review, we start by explaining the steps involved in writing a CAT for a clinical purpose and introduce some of the available electronic CAT makers.

## How to write a CAT?

Writing a CAT involves five steps along the five steps of evidence-based practice which can be summarized as “Ask,” “Search,” “Appraise,” “Apply,” and “Evaluate” . These steps are:

- 1.
Asking a focused and answerable question that translates uncertainty to an answerable question

Statistical Measures for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Literature


Measure Meaning Interpretation Diagnostic literature Sensitivity Patients with the disease with positive test results (“true positives”)/patients with disease Negative test result in a highly sensitive test can rule out the disease if prevalence is relatively low Specificity Patients without the disease with negative results (“true negatives”)/well people (no disease) Positive test result in a highly specific test can rule in the disease if prevalence is relatively high Positive predictive value (PPV) Patient with true positive test results/all patients with positive test result (true positives + false positives) This value is affected by the prevalence in the population studied. If a test has a high PPV (>95%) in your population, one may confidently commence treatment Negative predictive value (NPV) Patients with true negative results/all patients with negative test result (true negatives + false negatives) This value is affected by the prevalence in the population studied. If a test has a high NPV (>95%) in your population, one May be able to safely withhold treatment Likelihood ratio (LR) Likelihood of a given test result in patients with disease/the likelihood of the same result in patients without disease LR = 0 (negative LR): excludes the disease

LR = infinity (positive LR): confirms the disease

LR = 1 the test result is uninformative as the result is equally likely in the two groups Therapeutic literature Relative risk (RR) Risk of developing disease (or outcome) in the treatment group/risk of developing disease (or outcome) in the control group RR = 1: no difference between groups

RR <1 treatment reduces the risk of the disease

RR >1 treatment increases the risk of the disease Absolute risk (AR) Difference in the rates of events calculated as the rate in the control group minus the rate in the experimental group AR = 0 no difference between groups

AR positive: treatment is beneficial

AR negative: treatment is harmful Number needed to treat The number of patients needed to be treated for one of them to benefit from the treatment Number needed to harm The number of patients needed to be treated for 1 patient to experience an adverse effect
