## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to investigate whether intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can differentiate luminal-B from luminal-A breast cancer

## Materials and Methods

Biexponential analyses of IVIM and DCE MRI were performed using a 3.0-T MRI scanner, involving 134 patients with 137 pathologically confirmed luminal-type invasive breast cancers. Luminal-type breast cancer was categorized as luminal-B breast cancer (LBBC, Ki-67 ≧ 14%) or luminal-A breast cancer (LABC, Ki-67 < 14%). Quantitative parameters from IVIM (pure diffusion coefficient \[D\], perfusion-related diffusion coefficient \[D\*\], and fraction \[f\]) and DCE MRI (initial percentage of enhancement and signal enhancement ratio \[SER\]) were calculated. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was also calculated using monoexponential fitting. We correlated these data with the Ki-67 status.

## Results

The D and ADC values of LBBC were significantly lower than those of LABC ( _P_ = 0.028, _P_ = 0.037). The SER of LBBC was significantly higher than that of LABC ( _P_ = 0.004). A univariate analysis showed that a significantly lower D (<0.847 x 10  −3 mm  2 /s), lower ADC (<0.960 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s), and higher SER (>1.071) values were associated with LBBC (all _P_ values <0.01), compared to LABC. In a multivariate analysis, a higher SER (>1.071; odds ratio: 3.0099, 95% confidence interval: 1.4246–6.3593; _P_ = 0.003) value and a lower D (<0.847 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s; odds ratio: 2.6878, 95% confidence interval: 1.0445–6.9162; _P_ = 0.040) value were significantly associated with LBBC, compared to LABC.

## Conclusion

The SER derived from DCE MRI and the D derived from IVIM are associated independently with the Ki-67 status in patients with luminal-type breast cancer.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is a group of heterogeneous diseases with various degrees of differentiation and gene expression of the cancer cell . Breast cancer is classified by genetic analysis into several intrinsic subtypes . Clinically, the three major subtypes categorized according to immunohistochemical methods are as follows: estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, and triple negative . The treatment strategy is anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive cancer and chemotherapy for triple negative cancer .

ER-positive and HER2-negative (luminal-type) breast cancer is the most frequent subtype. Clinically, the Ki-67 labeling index is used to categorize luminal-type breast cancer into luminal-A breast cancer (LABC, Ki-67 < 14%) and luminal-B breast cancer (LBBC, Ki67 ≧ 14%) . However, this measurement is not standardized, and there are many problems with quality control. The numerical value is expected to be different by the pathologist diagnosing the tumor. Unlike HER2-positive and triple negative cancer, the treatment strategy for luminal-type cancer is determined by the treating physician alone. For the patients with luminal-type cancer, physicians are often hesitant regarding which case to administer chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy . Ability to judge the grade of the malignancy of the whole tumor before the surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is of major benefit to the physicians.
