## Rationale and Objectives

Although a checklist has been recommended for preventing satisfaction of search (SOS) errors, a previous research study did not demonstrate that benefit. However, observers in that study had to turn away from the image display to use the checklist. The current study tested a vocalized checklist to avoid this constraint.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 64 chest computed radiographs, half containing various “test” abnormalities, were read twice by 20 radiologists, once with and once without the addition of a simulated pulmonary nodule. Readers used a vocalized checklist-directing search. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) detection accuracy and decision thresholds were analyzed to study the effects of adding the nodule on detecting the test abnormalities.

## Results

Adding nodules induced a substantial reluctance to report the other abnormalities ( _P_ < 0.001), as had been the case in the most recent study of the SOS effect in radiography.

## Conclusions

The vocalized checklist did not reduce nor eliminate the SOS effect on readiness to report further abnormalities. Although useful for organizing search and reporting, particularly among students, a vocalized checklist does not prevent SOS effects.

## Introduction

Laboratory studies conducted in 1990 and 2000 demonstrated a satisfaction of search (SOS) effect in chest radiology with reduced accuracy in detecting native abnormalities on chest radiographs in the presence of simulated pulmonary nodules . A more recent study suggested that adding nodules may not always reduce detection accuracy for the other abnormalities, but rather induces a reluctance to report them . The authors suggested that this change may reflect changes in the practice and training of radiologists related to the ascendance of three-dimensional imaging modalities.

Checklists have been recommended to counteract SOS errors in radiology . Using the same radiographs as the 1990 and 2000 papers, a 2006 experiment studied whether self-prompting can prevent reader errors due to SOS . A printed checklist was produced as a booklet and contained a page for each case that required the reader to explicitly report on each item on the checklist (e.g., neck, mediastinum; heart/vessels; lungs; pleura; abdomen; bones). The results indicated that there was no SOS effect on detection accuracy; instead, detection accuracy seemed to be reduced even when the added nodule was _not_ present. The authors interpreted this finding, suggesting that using the checklist may have interfered with the radiologist's visual search because for some readers, the order of elements in the printed checklist differed from the order they prefer in the clinic. The checklist may have also interrupted the radiologist's search as they had to take their eyes off the display and look at the booklet to follow the checklist.
