## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate if anisotropy at two-dimensional shear wave elastography (SWE) suggests malignancy and whether it correlates with prognostic and predictive factors in breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

Study group A of 244 solid breast lesions was imaged with SWE between April 2013 and May 2014. Each lesion was imaged in radial and in antiradial planes, and the maximum elasticity, mean elasticity, and standard deviation were recorded and correlated with benign/malignant status, and if malignant, correlated with conventional predictive and prognostic factors. The results were compared to a study group B of 968 solid breast lesions, which were imaged in sagittal and in axial planes between 2010 and 2013.

## Results

Neither benign nor malignant lesion anisotropy is plane dependent. However, malignant lesions are more anisotropic than benign lesions ( _P_ ≤ 0.001). Anisotropy correlates with increasing elasticity parameters, breast imaging-reporting and data system categories, core biopsy result, and tumor grade. Large cancers are significantly more anisotropic than small cancers ( _P_ ≤ 0.001). The optimal anisotropy cutoff threshold for benign/malignant differentiation of 150 kPa  2 achieves the best sensitivity (74%) with a reasonable specificity (63%).

## Conclusions

Anisotropy may be useful during benign/malignant differentiation of solid breast masses using SWE. Anisotropy also correlates with some prognostic factors in breast cancer.

## Introduction

Supersonic shear wave elastography (SWE) is an ultrasound imaging modality that visualizes the elasticity of tissue. It was introduced by Bercoff et al. in 2004 and has been in clinical use since 2009 . During examinations, the propagation speed of the shear wave is measured and the elasticity, represented as Young's modulus E, is calculated as

E=3ϱc2
E

=

3

ϱ

c

2


where c is the propagation speed of the shear wave and ϱ is the density of the tissue. Thus. SWE is a quantitative measurement method. The elasticity is visualized as a color map overlaying the grayscale B-mode ultrasound image of the lesion. As the shear wave is induced by applying an acoustic radiation force, there is no need to move the transducer. A good interobserver reproducibility can be achieved . Furthermore, Berg et al. have shown that analyzing the quantitative elasticity of a lesion with SWE is useful for the differentiation of benign and malignant lesions as malignant tissue is generally stiffer than benign tissue . Berg et al. recommended the use of a cutoff threshold for the maximum elasticity (E  max ) of 80 kPa for the optimal benign/malignant differentiation . Evans et al. recommended a cutoff threshold for the mean elasticity (E  mean ) of 50 kPa .
