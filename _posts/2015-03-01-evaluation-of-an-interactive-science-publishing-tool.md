## Rationale and Objectives

Higher resolution medical imaging platforms are rapidly emerging, but there is a challenge in applying these tools in a clinically meaningful way. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a novel three-dimensional (3D) software imaging environment, known as interactive science publishing (ISP), in appraising 3D computed tomography images and to compare this approach with traditional planar (2D) imaging in a series of lung cancer cases.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-four physician volunteers at different levels of training across multiple specialties were recruited to evaluate eight lung cancer–related clinical vignettes. The volunteers were asked to compare the performance of traditional 2D versus the ISP 3D imaging in assessing different visualization environments for diagnostic and measurement processes and to further evaluate the ISP tool in terms of general satisfaction, usability, and probable applicability.

## Results

Volunteers were satisfied with both imaging methods; however, the 3D environment had significantly higher ratings. Measurement performance was comparable using both traditional 2D and 3D image evaluation. Physicians not trained in 2D measurement approaches versus those with such training demonstrated better performance with ISP and preferred working in the ISP environment.

## Conclusions

Recent postgraduates with only modest self-administered training performed equally well on 3D and 2D cases. This suggests that the 3D environment has no reduction in accuracy over the conventional 2D approach, while providing the advantage of a digital environment for cross-disciplinary interaction for shared problem solving. Exploration of more effective, efficient, self-directed training could potentially result in further improvement in image evaluation proficiency and potentially decrease training costs.

Over the past decade, medical imaging has undergone exponential improvements; however, the ability to use the detailed, textured outputs of these tools requires an understanding of how to manipulate digital imaging data to ensure correct interpretation in guiding clinical management . This area of image processing is thought to be the province of radiologists, but ongoing trends suggest a greater inclusion of many medical disciplines in applying high-resolution imaging in clinical management. Yet the foundational knowledge of proper application of quantitative imaging tools in medical curriculum has not yet emerged as a major focus.

Although the technological evolution of medical imaging is moving rapidly, the integration of this new and vast source of digital data into meaningful clinical application is slow. This integration mismatch relates to a number of issues, including pressure to accelerate standard workflow and the inertial influence of shrinking reimbursement. However, the greatest current barrier to implementing image processing approaches may be that clinicians have not been educated about the potential of quantitative imaging. Thus, a knowledge gap exists in how best to apply robust imaging techniques to change the practice of medicine.
