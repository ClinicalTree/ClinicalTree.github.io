The Physics of Clinical MR Taught Through Images, Second Edition, is a concise treatise illustrating both basic and advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques in an easy-to-understand format. The text is arranged into 110 chapters, with each chapter describing a clinically relevant topic in two to four pages. True to the title, equations and theoretical physics concepts are not included. Instead, images are used to compare techniques and principles (eg, spin echo vs fast spin echo). Most of the chapters can be read independently, allowing readers more familiar with basic MR principles to use the text as a reference.

The first portion of the book focuses on basic principles, including MR safety and the differences between proton density, T1 and T2 weighting. Other fundamental concepts, such as signal-to noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, field of view, matrix size, and artifacts are scattered throughout the text. Early chapters also discuss different implementations of spin-echo and gradient-echo imaging, including fast spin echo, half-acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo, dual-echo steady state, balanced steady-state free precession, and turbo fast low-angle shot.

The second half of the book is devoted to more advanced imaging techniques and anatomy-specific MR imaging. Chapters in this portion of the book describe three-dimensional imaging, non-contrast-enhanced and contrast-enhanced MR angiography, diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and MR spectroscopy. Specific chapters on cardiac imaging, MR mammography, and MR cholangiopancreatography are also included.

For each implementation of a new MR sequence, the corresponding pulse diagram is shown. These diagrams are not thoroughly described in the text and, consequently, can be both helpful and confusing. The basic concepts and functional differences between the sequences can, however, be learned through the corresponding clinical images without having an in-depth understanding of the pulse diagrams. Indeed, the authors state that these pulse diagrams may be confusing and will make more sense as the reader progresses through the text. Overall, the image quality in the book is adequate to illustrate the MR principles and differences in pulse sequences covered. Most of the images are derived for neuroradiology examples.

The final chapter of the book is dedicated to the multitude of acronyms for pulse sequences used by the major MR equipment vendors. Although the acronyms covered in the earlier chapters of the book are summarized in table format, a more complete tabulation would be helpful for those readers using this book as a reference. References for more in-depth explanations are noticeably missing. However, an ample index is included for quick reference.

In conclusion, this is a well-written, concise text for readers interested in learning basic MR principles and the differences between MR pulse sequences presented through short explanations and illustrative clinical images.
