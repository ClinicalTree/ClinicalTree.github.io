## Rationale and Objectives

Studies suggest that electrocardiographically gated coronary computed tomographic angiography provides a clear definition of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT), and normal LVOT morphology may not be round, as assumed when the continuity equation is applied during echocardiography. The aims of this study were to demonstrate the morphology of the LVOT on coronary computed tomographic angiography and to establish normal values for LVOT measurements.

## Materials and Methods

Two independent readers retrospectively measured anterior-posterior (AP) and transverse diameters of the LVOT and performed LVOT planimetry on coronary computed tomographic angiographic studies of 106 consecutive patients with normal aortic valves.

## Results

Excellent interobserver agreement was observed for all measurements ( _r_ = 0.78–0.94). The LVOT was ovoid, with a larger transverse diameter than AP diameter during diastole and systole ( _P_ < .001). However, the ratio of AP diameter to transverse diameter was closer to 1.0 during systole ( _P_ < .001). Mean indexed LVOT area was minimally larger in systole than in diastole ( _P_ = .01–.04) and was larger in men than in women during diastole ( _P_ ≤ .001) and systole ( _P_ ≤ .01). Mean LVOT area indexed to body surface area was 2.3 ± 0.5 cm  2 /m  2 in women and 2.6 ± 0.7 cm  2 /m  2 in men. LVOT area demonstrated significant correlation with aortic root diameter.

## Conclusions

The normal LVOT is ovoid in shape. LVOT is more circular during systole, but the AP diameter remains smaller than the transverse diameter throughout the cardiac cycle. The oval shape of the LVOT has important implications when LVOT area is calculated from LVOT diameters. Normal LVOT area values established in this study should facilitate diagnosis of the fixed component of LVOT obstruction.

A diagnosis of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is suggested by an elevated gradient in the LVOT in the setting of a normal aortic valve. LVOT obstruction is classified into two categories, dynamic and fixed, which may coexist. Dynamic LVOT obstruction is classically associated with primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic disorder of sarcomeric proteins . Many of these patients demonstrate asymmetric hypertrophy of the ventricular septum and dynamic left ventricular contraction, which draw the anterior mitral valve leaflet or its chordal apparatus into the LVOT during mid to late systole . Fixed LVOT obstruction is a congenital abnormality in which reduced outflow tract area may be related to fibromuscular narrowing, a discrete fibrous ring, or a membrane. A dynamic component that changes in severity during ventricular ejection can coexist with fixed obstruction, complicating the assessment and treatment of LVOT obstruction .

Two-dimensional transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTE) is widely used for the diagnosis of LVOT obstruction by measuring Doppler-derived pressure gradients . Decisions regarding the timing of surgery for fixed LVOT obstruction are based on Doppler-derived gradient measures . However, this method has inherent limitations, such as variation in gradients with changes in cardiac output and the challenge of separating fixed from dynamic components of gradients measured in the LVOT. Accurate depiction of the shape and size of the LVOT is critical in this decision process. Thus, the ability to produce high-resolution static and dynamic images of the LVOT throughout the cardiac cycle with electrocardiographically (ECG) gated computed tomographic (CT) angiography provides a unique opportunity for the evaluation of LVOT obstruction.

![Figure 3, A 40-year-old man (body surface area, 2.14 m 2 ) with an unclear history of repaired congenital aortic stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated an elevated velocity of 1.9 m/s through the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) at rest despite a normal opening of the aortic valve (2.7 cm 2 by planimetry). (a) Coronary computed tomographic angiographic image in the three-chamber view shows normal systolic opening of the aortic valve, with no evidence of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. (b) Short-axis view shows the LVOT in cross-section with anterior-posterior diameter (minor axis) of 1.8 cm and transverse diameter (major axis) of 2.6 cm. (c) Short-axis view with freehand tracing of the LVOT for planimetry demonstrates an LVOT area of 3.59 cm 2 (indexed area, 3.59 cm 2 /2.14 m 2 = 1.68 cm 2 /m 2 ), which is approximately 1.5 standard deviations below the expected mean male LVOT area (see Table 5 ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/CharacterizationandNormalMeasurementsoftheLeftVentricularOutflowTractbyECGgatedCardiacCT/2_1s20S1076633212003224.jpg)

![Figure 4, A 61-year-old man (body surface area, 2.28 m 2 ) with normal left ventricular systolic function. A fixed left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient of 55 mm Hg as well as a second dynamic gradient of 54 mm Hg were measured by transthoracic echocardiography. The aortic valve was mildly thickened, with normal motion. (a) Coronary computed tomographic (CT) angiographic image in the three-chamber view demonstrates coaptation of the mitral valve. The coapted leaflet tips are tilted toward the interventricular septum; cine images (not shown) were interpreted as demonstrating systolic anterior motion of the associated chordal structures. (b) Short-axis coronary CT angiographic image shows the LVOT in cross-section with anterior-posterior diameter (minor axis) of 1.6 cm and transverse diameter (major axis) of 2.1 cm. (c) Short-axis coronary CT angiographic image shows freehand tracing of the LVOT in cross-section with planimetry measure of 2.41 cm 2 (indexed area = 2.41 cm 2 /2.28 m 2 = 1.06 cm 2 /m 2 ), which is approximately 2.5 standard deviations below the expected mean male LVOT area (see Table 5 ). CT angiography was helpful in demonstrating both the dynamic and fixed components of the LVOT obstruction.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/CharacterizationandNormalMeasurementsoftheLeftVentricularOutflowTractbyECGgatedCardiacCT/3_1s20S1076633212003224.jpg)
