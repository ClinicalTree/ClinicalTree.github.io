## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based texture analysis has been shown to be effective in classifying multiple sclerosis lesions. Regarding the clinical use of texture analysis in multiple sclerosis, our intention was to show which parts of the analysis are sensitive to slight changes in textural data acquisition and which steps tolerate interference.

## Materials and Methods

The MRI datasets of 38 multiple sclerosis patients were used in this study. Three imaging sequences were compared in quantitative analyses, including a comparison of anatomical levels of interest, variance between sequential slices and two methods of region of interest drawing. We focused on the classification of white matter and multiple sclerosis lesions in determining the discriminatory power of textural parameters. Analyses were run with MaZda software for texture analysis, and statistical tests were performed for raw parameters.

## Results

MRI texture analysis based on statistical, autoregressive-model and wavelet-derived texture parameters provided an excellent distinction between the image regions corresponding to multiple sclerosis plaques and white matter or normal-appearing white matter with high accuracy (nonlinear discriminant analysis 96%–100%). There were no significant differences in the classification results between imaging sequences or between anatomical levels. Standardized regions of interest were tolerant of changes within an anatomical level when intra-tissue variance was tested.

## Conclusion

The MRI texture analysis protocol with fixed imaging sequence and anatomical levels of interest shows promise as a robust quantitative clinical means for evaluating multiple sclerosis lesions.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease of the central nervous system, with complex pathophysiology, including inflammation, demyelination, axonal degeneration, and neuronal loss. According to recent pathological evidence, these processes are not similarly represented in different patients, but may predominate selectively in individual patients, leading to heterogeneity in the expression of disease phenotypes. This diverse representation of different pathologies is also reflected in disease prognosis and response to therapies.

Diagnostic evaluation of MS with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally based on the McDonald criteria . The development of modern imaging techniques for the early detection of brain inflammation and the characterization of tissue-specific injury is an important objective in MS research. The development of new imaging techniques is targeted especially at the identification of high-risk individuals in the early phase of MS disease and at the improved monitoring of disease activity. A better understanding of disease pathogenesis is also the basis for the further development of new and more effective therapies.
