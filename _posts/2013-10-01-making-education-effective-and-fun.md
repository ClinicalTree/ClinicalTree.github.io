## Rationale and Objectives

A hands-on stations-based approach to teaching anatomy to third-year medical students is used at Boston University. The goal of our study was to demonstrate that such an interactive, team-based approach to teaching anatomy would be well received and be helpful in recall, comprehension, and reinforcement of anatomy learned in the first year of medical school.

## Materials and Methods

Each radiology-anatomy correlation lab was focused on one particular anatomic part, such as skull base, pelvis, coronary anatomy, etc. Four stations, including a three-dimensional model, computer, ultrasound, and posters, were created for each lab. Informed consent was obtained before online survey dissemination to assess the effectiveness and quality of radiology-anatomy correlation lab. This study was approved by our institutional institutional review board, and data were analyzed using a χ  2 test.

## Results

Survey data were collected from February 2010 through March 2012. The response rate was 33.5%. Overall, the highest percentage of students (46%) found the three-dimensional model station to be the most valuable. The computer station was most helpful in recall of the anatomic principles from the first year of medical school. Regarding the quality of the anatomy lab, less than 2% of the students thought that the images were of poor quality or the material presented was not clinically relevant.

## Discussion

Our results indicate that an interactive, team-based approach to teaching anatomy was well received by the medical students. It was engaging and students were able to benefit from it in multiple ways.

A strong working knowledge of anatomy is essential to learn radiology, for radiologists as well as clinicians reviewing cases with their patients or interpreting imaging reports. In a traditional medical school curriculum, human anatomy is taught in the first year, whereas radiology clerkships, if offered, are generally in the clinical third or fourth years . Studies have shown that retention of anatomic knowledge from the first year to clinical third or fourth years is poor . In studies examining retention of anatomic knowledge in Dutch medical students, it was shown that learning anatomy in a clinically oriented manner and revisiting topics later in the clinical curriculum led to improved test performance . From these studies, it can be inferred that medical students would benefit from revisiting key anatomic concepts during the radiology clerkship to enhance their level of understanding and retention. Based on this belief, radiology-anatomy correlation labs (RACL) were developed in collaboration between the Anatomy Department and the Radiology Department, to allow third-year medical students to revisit key concepts learned in first-year anatomy course and place them in the context of a clinical setting. Our group has previously published the description of these active learning exercises, which are integrated into RACL stations .

At our institution, radiology is a required month-long clinical clerkship for third-year medical students. RACL takes place once during the radiology clerkship, giving students a chance to rotate through the lab once during their rotation. Each RACL session, which lasts 1.5–2 hours, focuses on one specific anatomic region. Labs designed to date include brachial plexus, pelvic anatomy, coronary circulation, skull base anatomy, liver/portal system, and upper/lower extremity vascular access sites. One month, the group rotating through the radiology clerkship may participate in the pelvic anatomy RACL, while during another month, another group may participate in a skull base anatomy RACL, and so on. For the RACL, students are divided into four groups that rotate among four task-oriented stations, which are focused on a single anatomic part: (a) a station of 3D (three-dimensional) model construction, where students assemble a complex part of the body from component parts; (b) a poster station with typical imaging of the body area being studied for identification; (c) a computer station with video clips that allow scrolling through cross-sectional exams or angiography/fluoroscopy in real-time; and (d) a hands-on ultrasound (US) station for students to practice scanning techniques pertinent to the specific anatomic part. Each RACL is lead by three or four instructors, which may include radiology residents, radiology attendings, and anatomy department faculty (The instructors were recruited on a voluntary basis via an e-mail, which included information on the anatomy module being covered.) The goal of our study was to demonstrate that such an interactive, team-based approach to teaching anatomy would be well received and would be helpful in recall, comprehension, and reinforcement of anatomy learned in the first year of medical school.
