This book is one of a multibook series published by Thieme (series title _RadCases_ ), each covering a major subspecialty of radiology. As with the others, it is a compilation of 100 cases geared toward giving radiology residents a review of commonly encountered and need-to-know diagnoses. Each unknown case is presented on a single page, with the diagnosis and discussion on the following page. The overall format is easy to follow, and lends itself to short sessions but can certainly be read straight through. The text’s large (but thin) size allows full or near-full resolution image recreation, which is very useful for some of the more subtle findings.

The organization of each case discussion is unwavering. On the page following the unknown images and a one-line history, an initial section recaps the pertinent imaging findings. The images are re-presented with arrows and accompanying text is given in a boards-style monologue that gives a concise description. The next section given for each case is a differential diagnosis. This is a bullet point list of two to five diagnoses, with a brief discussion of points in favor and points against. An essential facts section follows, which discusses the findings and other pertinent information in more detail. Each point of fact is again bulleted. Occasionally, other imaging findings are discussed following this, tending to focus on classic imaging features that may not be present on the given images.

The last section for each case is called Pearls and Pitfalls. This, like the other sections, contains bulleted factoids. Most pearls given in this section could easily fit into the prior “essential facts” section, and the distinction between the two sections is sometimes lacking. The given pitfalls, however, can be very useful. These include limitations of technique, contraindications, and other facts that should always be considered when evaluating certain examinations.

The examinations are a mix of fluoroscopic contrast studies, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance, with occasional ultrasound correlation. The image quality is usually very good, well windowed, and cropped appropriately, although there are rare cases where the finding is not well seen even when pointed out directly on the following page. The cases are core diagnoses common to gastrointestinal imaging. More common or important diagnoses are repeated (such as Crohn’s disease), with different manifestations. More uncommon diagnoses do appear, though are in the minority. The case mix is overall very good, stressing need-to-know pathology.

In addition to the cases in the book, your purchase allows you access to the online version of the book, which includes 150 additional cases, plus the 100 in the book. These are organized in an identical fashion, though you are given the ability to zoom in on images. A short registration is required.

The text is well written, easy to navigate, and the book layout promotes self-examination. The online addition provides another cache of predominantly excellent cases. It serves its purpose well as a source of good core cases for general radiology residents preparing for boards or recertification examinees.
