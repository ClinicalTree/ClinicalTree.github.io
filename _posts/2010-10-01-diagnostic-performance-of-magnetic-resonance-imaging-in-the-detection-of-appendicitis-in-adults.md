## Rationale and Objectives

Perform a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

## Materials and Methods

MEDLINE and EMBASE were queried between January 1995 and December 2009. Prospective and retrospective studies were included if they: used MRI as a diagnostic test for appendicitis, used pathology or clinical follow-up as the reference standard, and reported absolute number of true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative results, or stated sufficient data to derive these values. Summary sensitivity, summary specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+) and (LR-), and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated. Heterogeneity of the results was assessed using Forest plots and the value of inconsistency index (I  2 ).

## Results

The inclusion criteria were fulfilled by eight articles with a total of 363 patients (mean age 26.9 ± 7.2 years; 86.2 % female). The appendix was not found in eight patients, with one article not reporting such data. The summary sensitivity was 97% (92%–99% at 95% confidence interval \[CI\]) and summary specificity was 95% (CI: 94%–99%), with a LR+ of 16.3 (CI: 9.1–29.1) and a LR- of 0.09 (CI: 0.04–0.197). Diagnostic odds ratio was 299.85 (CI: 97.5–921.61). No heterogeneity was found in the sensitivity (I  2 = 0.0, _P_ = .4589). Minimal heterogeneity was found in the specificity (I  2 = 21.9%, _P_ = .2553).

## Conclusion

MRI appears promising in the evaluation of acute appendicitis, although larger future studies are warranted to confirm the results.

Acute appendicitis is a common etiology for acute abdominal pain and the need for emergent surgery. Although clinical and laboratory correlation may be enough for diagnosis, more clinicians are relying on radiological evaluation of the abdomen to make a definitive diagnosis . Additionally, up to one third of patients with appendicitis present with atypical symptoms that complicate a clinical diagnosis of appendicitis . Additionally, certain laboratory parameters may mire clinical diagnosis, such as physiologic leukocytosis of pregnancy . These dilemmas can potentially lead to unnecessary surgical intervention, thus more clinicians are using radiological evaluation for a definitive diagnosis .

Computed tomography (CT) is an established radiological procedure for the evaluation of acute appendicitis, but exposes the patient to ionizing radiation . With rising concerns of the public and medical communities with regard to increasing number of studies leading to increasing ionizing radiation exposure, alternative modalities have been investigated as potential diagnostic tools. This is especially true for pregnant patients, for whom acute appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdomen and there are special considerations to avoid ionizing radiation. .

The dOR ranges from 0 to infinity. The higher the value, the better the test is at discriminating between those with and without the disease. A value of 1 is indicative of no discrimination. A value less than 1 indicates tests were interpreted poorly (more negative tests among those with disease).
