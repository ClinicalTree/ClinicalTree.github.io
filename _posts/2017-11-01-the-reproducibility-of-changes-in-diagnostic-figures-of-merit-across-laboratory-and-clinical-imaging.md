## Rationale and Objectives

In this paper we examine which comparisons of reading performance between diagnostic imaging systems made in controlled retrospective laboratory studies may be representative of what we observe in later clinical studies. The change in a meaningful diagnostic figure of merit between two diagnostic modalities should be qualitatively or quantitatively comparable across all kinds of studies.

## Materials and Methods

In this meta-study we examine the reproducibility of relative measures of sensitivity, false positive fraction (FPF), area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and expected utility across laboratory and observational clinical studies for several different breast imaging modalities, including screen film mammography, digital mammography, breast tomosynthesis, and ultrasound.

## Results

Across studies of all types, the changes in the FPFs yielded very small probabilities of having a common mean value. The probabilities of relative sensitivity being the same across ultrasound and tomosynthesis studies were low. No evidence was found for different mean values of relative area under the ROC curve or relative expected utility within any of the study sets.

## Conclusion

The comparison demonstrates that the ratios of areas under the ROC curve and expected utilities are reproducible across laboratory and clinical studies, whereas sensitivity and FPF are not.

## Introduction

Studies of reader performance play an important role in evaluations of the effectiveness of new diagnostic imaging devices and methodologies . These studies are particularly common in applications where a diagnostic task can be simplified to a binary choice, as in breast cancer screening where the goal is to identify abnormalities for subsequent analysis. From this perspective, the screening examination sorts the cases into “negative” and “positive” categories. Binary tasks are commonly characterized by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots true positive fraction (TPF; the fraction of disease cases correctly labeled positive) as a function of the false positive fraction (FPF; the fraction of nondisease cases incorrectly labeled as positive). The ROC curve serves as the underlying framework from which various figures of merit (FOMs) of imaging performance can be defined.

Before using a new diagnostic imaging modality in clinical practice, a laboratory reader study of the modality may be performed to determine its diagnostic effectiveness for regulatory purposes or to demonstrate its capabilities for the medical community. Often this study will compare the performance of the new modality in one study arm to the standard of care in a control arm . These preclinical reader studies differ from clinical trials in a number of ways that make the studies far less time-consuming and costly. They generally require a much smaller sample of patient examinations, which limits the potential for side effects of imaging, including exposure to ionizing radiation or intravenous contrast agents. In imaging tasks that have low disease prevalence, for example, asymptomatic breast-cancer screening, the patient sample is usually enriched with cases of disease through various possible sampling strategies . Other differences may include limited access to additional clinical data (prior examinations, patient symptoms, or history), a different reporting format that may include nonstandard measures such as a probability of malignancy rating, and use of retrospective data that results in a lack of direct consequences for patient management.

where TPF _c_ and FPF _c_ are the TPF and FPF on a reader's ROC curve where the slope of the curve is _β_ . Based on the clinical practice of mammography, Abbey et al. determined that the average value of _β_ is approximately 1.03 for breast cancer screening in the United States.  Figure 1 shows EU graphically as an intercept of a line with slope _β_ that is tangent to the diagnostic test's ROC curve at the optimal or clinical TPF, FPF operating point.

> If primary studies provide only sufficient information to estimate sensitivity and specificity, the mean sensitivity and the mean specificity can be estimated, possibly weighted in some way for the sample size of each study. However, this technique is inappropriate because it is likely that different studies use different explicit or implicit thresholds, so that a primary study with a high sensitivity may have a low specificity and vice versa.
