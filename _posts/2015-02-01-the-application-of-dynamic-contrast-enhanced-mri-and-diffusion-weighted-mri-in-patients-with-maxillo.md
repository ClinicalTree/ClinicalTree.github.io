## Rationale and Objectives

To elucidate the characteristics of four types of tumors, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), malignant lymphoma (ML), malignant salivary gland tumors (MSGTs), and pleomorphic adenoma (Pleo), in the maxillofacial region using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI）data.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 59 tumors were included in this research. DCE-MRI and DW-MRI were performed. We applied the Tofts and Kermode model (TK model) for the DCE-MRI data and obtained three dependent parameters: the influx forward volume transfer constant into the extravascular extracellular space from the plasma ( _K_ trans ), the fractional volume of extravascular extracellular space per unit volume of tissue ( _v_ e ), and the fractional volume of plasma ( _v_ p ).

## Results

Among the _K_ trans values, there were no significant differences between the three types of malignant tumors; however, there was a significant difference between the SCC and Pleo ( _P_ = .0099). The _v_ e values of the Pleo were highest, with significant differences compared to the other categories (SCC, _P_ = .0012; ML, _P_ = .0017; and MSGT, _P_ = .041). The ML had the lowest _v_ e values, and there were significant differences between ML and the other two types of malignant tumors (SCC, _P_ = .0278 and MSGT, _P_ = .0062). In 14 (24%) cases, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) could not be measured because of poor image quality. The ADC values of the ML were lowest, whereas those of Pleo were highest, similar to that observed for _v_ e .

## Conclusions

The Pleo tumors had lower _K_ trans values and higher _v_ e values, which are useful for differentiating them from the malignant tumors. Moreover, the _v_ e was also useful for establishing a diagnosis of ML.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), malignant lymphoma (ML), and salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are commonly found in the maxillofacial region. The treatment choice for SCC and SGT is complete surgical removal, whereas benign SGTs are sometimes treated with long-term follow-up. Meanwhile, ML is treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or a combination of these modalities. Therefore, it is important to differentiate ML from other tumors as soon as possible in the early stage .

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is effective for diagnosing tumors and has some advantages over traditional techniques, especially in identifying soft tissue lesions . The validity of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) has previously been established in SGT . The most conventional assessment with DCE-MRI involves the use of characteristics of the time-intensity curves (TICs) of regions of interest (ROIs). The simple quantification of TIC, such as the use of parameters including the time to peak enhancement ( _T__p_ eak ) and washout ratio (WR), is commonly used . The _T_ peak is considered to represent the microvessel count, and the threshold between benign and malignant tumors has been described in previous articles to be approximately 120 seconds . The WR represents the difference in the concentration of contrast medium (CM) between the intravascular (arterial) and extravascular (equilibrium) phases; therefore, tumors with high cellularity exhibit higher WR values. However, the WR depends on the scan parameters .
