## Rationale and Objectives

Atypical lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and lobular neoplasia are nonmalignant lesions that are associated with significant increased risk of developing breast cancer. Atypical lesions have been reported to present with focal increased radiotracer uptake on breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) examination, a novel physiologic tool for the detection of breast cancer. To date the sensitivity of BSGI in the detection of atypical lesions has not been reported. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of BSGI in detecting ADH and lobular neoplasia.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 1316 patients who received a BSGI exam between January 2006 and July 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients who underwent minimally invasive biopsy and subsequent surgical excision where the highest pathology was solely ADH or lobular neoplasia (reported as ALH, lobular carcinoma in situ or lobular neoplasia), according to the pathology database were included ( _n_ = 15). The sensitivity was determined as the percentage of positive BSGI exams out of all patients diagnosed with ADH or lobular neoplasia who received a BSGI.

## Results

Patient ages ranged from 39 to 67 (mean, 52). Eight of 15 patients had ADH, 6/15 lobular neoplasia, and 1/15 ADH and lobular neoplasia in one lesion. Fifteen of the 15 (100%) patients with surgically confirmed ADH or lobular neoplasia had a positive BSGI, with focally increased radiotracer uptake at the site of the verified high-risk lesion.

## Conclusion

BSGI has a high sensitivity for the detection of atypical, high-risk breast lesions. A diagnosis of an atypical lesion is concordant with focal increased radiotracer uptake with BSGI and can identify women at increased risk for breast cancer.

Breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) is an adjunct technology used to complement mammography and ultrasound in the detection and follow-up of breast cancer. There has been a recent resurgence of gamma imaging since the advent of high-resolution, small field of view gamma cameras. Nuclear imaging identifies areas of the breast that have increased metabolism as compared with normal breast tissue, complementing mammography by detecting cancer physiologically rather than anatomically. BSGI has a sensitivity of 96.4% for detecting carcinoma, 91% for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 93% for invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) . The sensitivity of BSGI is comparable to that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but BSGI has shown to have a higher specificity for carcinoma . BSGI is already being used clinically at many centers. Clinical and research indications suggested by the Society of Nuclear Imaging include: evaluation of patients with recently diagnosed malignancy, patients at high risk of breast malignancy, patients with indeterminate breast abnormalities with remaining diagnostic concern, patients with technically difficult breast imaging, patients in whom MRI is contraindicated, and to monitor patients' responses to preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Recently, the American College of Radiology began an accreditation program for BSGI, further demonstrating its increasing inclusion in the armamentarium of tools for the improved diagnosis of breast cancer .

A BSGI study shows increased radiotracer uptake in areas of increased metabolism in the breast (ie, cancers as well as nonmalignant lesions such as inflammatory processes, fibroadenomas, papillomas, and atypical lesions) . Reports of BSGI's specificity for breast cancer range from 59.5% to 93% . High-risk lesions such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and lobular neoplasias have been reported to demonstrate increased radiotracer uptake in BSGI examination in recent studies; however, most current studies have considered high-risk lesions to be false positives with the focus of the study being carcinoma or DCIS .

![Figure 1, (a) A 55-year-old female with biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right breast underwent bilateral breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) in the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views to assess extent of disease and detect occult disease. BSGI revealed 2-cm area of focally increased radiotracer uptake in the right breast corresponding to biopsy-proven DCIS as well as foci of increased radiotracer uptake in the medial superior right (A) and lateral left (B) breast with no corresponding abnormality on mammography. (b) Second-look ultrasound demonstrated hypoechoic lesions in the right 2 o'clock (A) and left 3 o'clock (B) positions corresponding to the areas of increased radiotracer uptake. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed a papillary lesion with atypia in the right breast (A) as well as atypical ductal hyperplasia in the left breast (B). Patient subsequently opted for a double mastectomy and final pathology showed right DCIS with small foci of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) at the site of known cancer, right papillary lesion with atypia (A), and left ADH (B).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/BreastspecificGammaImagingintheDetectionofAtypicalDuctalHyperplasiaandLobularNeoplasia/0_1s20S1076633212000979.jpg)
