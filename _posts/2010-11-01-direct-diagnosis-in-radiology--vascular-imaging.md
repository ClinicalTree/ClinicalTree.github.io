Thieme's _Direct Diagnosis in Radiology: Vascular Imaging_ is a portable, well-organized, and efficient review of some of the more common (and a few less common) diagnoses that one may encounter when interpreting images that include vascular structures throughout the human body. Interestingly, there is a large amount of coverage within this book that I am accustomed to seeing included under the heading of neuroradiology.

This book has several strengths. The images are outstanding, especially considering its small size. Many figures include color, and this is welcome. It is relatively straightforward to navigate the book using the table of contents and index. The individual sections are mercifully brief but manage to contain a high yield of information. I was also impressed with how the inclusion of neurovascular topics seemed fluid and apropos; in my experience, this is unusual and notable.

Some potential areas for improvement may include the references that accompany the individual sections, many of which are many years old. As well, some of the verbiage seemed unusual to me, for example, “horizontal herniation” on page 52.

Overall, this book was easy to read, and one can get through a large amount of material relatively quickly. The book is very well illustrated and seemed to me to be of potential benefit to radiologists desiring to efficiently review these topics or to have a handy reference tool.
