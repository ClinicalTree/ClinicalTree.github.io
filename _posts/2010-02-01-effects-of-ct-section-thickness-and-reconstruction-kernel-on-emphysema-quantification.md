## Rationale and Objectives

Computed tomography (CT) section thickness and reconstruction kernel each influence CT measurements of emphysema. This study was performed to assess whether their effects are related to the magnitude of the measurement.

## Materials and Methods

Low-radiation-dose multidetector CT was performed in 21 subjects representing a wide range of emphysema severity. Images were reconstructed using 20 different combinations of section thickness and reconstruction kernel. Emphysema index values were determined as the percentage of lung pixels having attenuation lower than multiple thresholds ranging from −960 HU to −890 HU. The index values obtained from the different thickness-kernel combinations were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance and Bland-Altman plots of mean versus difference in all subjects, and correlated with quantitative histology (mean linear intercept, Lm) in a subset of resected lung specimens.

## Results

The effects of section thickness and reconstruction kernel on the emphysema index were significant ( _P_ < .001) and diminished as the index attenuation threshold was raised. The changes in index values from changing the thickness-kernel combination were largest for subjects with intermediate index values (10%–30%), and became progressively smaller for those with lower and higher index values. This pattern was consistent regardless of the thickness-kernel combinations compared and the HU threshold used. Correlations between the emphysema index values obtained with each thickness-kernel combination and Lm ranged from _r_ = 0.55–0.68 ( _P_ = .007–.03).

## Conclusion

The effects of CT section thickness and kernel on emphysema index values varied systematically with the magnitude of the emphysema index. All reconstruction techniques provided significant correlations with quantitative histology.

Quantitative computed tomography (CT) analysis of lung attenuation increasingly has been used in clinical research on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for the objective measurement of emphysema. Emphysema has been quantified from CT data obtained in clinical trials to identify associations between emphysema and demographic factors ( ), genetic factors , and body habitus ; to assess drug treatment effects ; to distinguish chronic obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes with and without emphysema ; and to evaluate the contribution of emphysema to airflow obstruction . Studies supporting the validity of measurements obtained using low-radiation-dose CT technique may further expand applications in clinical research.

As the use of CT for emphysema quantification has grown, the potential for measurement variability related to certain CT technical parameters has been recognized . It has been reported that CT estimates of emphysema severity increase as section thickness decreases , and that higher resolution (edge-enhancing, sharper) image reconstruction kernels (also referred to as algorithms or filters) result in higher CT measurements of emphysema than lower resolution (smoothing) kernels . These effects may impact the ability to combine or compare CT measurements of emphysema in cross-sectional or longitudinal studies in which section thickness and reconstruction kernel are not held constant. This is particularly relevant to retrospective studies in which these parameters can no longer be changed, to prospective multicenter studies using multiple CT scanner models with different section thickness and kernel options, and to longitudinal studies during which scanners are replaced with new models.

As histograms become shifted toward more negative HU values in (b) and (c) , area below the smooth kernel curve to the left of the threshold increases more than area under the sharp kernel curve.
