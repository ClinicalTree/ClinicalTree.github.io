The first edition of _Avoiding Errors in Radiology_ proves to be a succinct and organized collection of high-yield cases of easily missed and misinterpreted findings with preventative strategies for avoiding these findings.

The book is divided into seven chapters, titled cranium, chest, breast, abdomen, spinal column, musculoskeletal system, and vascular system. Every chapter has several high-yield “missed” cases, each of which includes the clinical history and findings, an analysis of the interpretation error, and strategies to prevent it. It also includes follow-up of the patient and references for further in-depth reading. This unique format allows the readers to actively test themselves on the initial images to determine if they will make an interpretation error. Certain topics also have in-depth interdisciplinary explanations, which range from technical aspects and protocols of imaging procedures to differential diagnosis.

This book is easy to navigate and has excellent images and illustrations to help understand the content. Because the authors are based in Germany, indications for studies, terminology, and diagnostic radiologic workup of certain diagnosis may differ from those used in the United States.

Overall, we can recalibrate our sensitivity on recognizing important findings through the use of this book, which is particularly useful for radiology residents preparing to take call because it focuses on avoiding cognitive errors on commonly missed topics. For practicing radiologists who rarely interpret subspecialized studies such as neuroradiology or musculoskeletal, this textbook touches on several blind spots that can be quickly reviewed.
