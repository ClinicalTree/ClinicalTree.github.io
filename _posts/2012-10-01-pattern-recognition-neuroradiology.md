Ease of readability, abundance of high-yield images, and systemizing an approach to radiologic interpretation are three characteristics that concisely summarize the essence of _Pattern Recognition Neuroradiology_ , a new print volume by Drs. Neil Borden and Scott Forseen. Deviating from the traditional medical textbook format of highly detailed and verbose descriptions of all pathologic processes pertaining to a certain anatomical structure, the authors illustrate a novel approach to diagnosing neurological disorders.

The first chapter of this volume briefly reviews basic concepts and terminology in neuroradiology, including how computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images are produced. This is conveyed in simple terms, with minimal emphasis on radiologic physics. The latter half of the first chapter introduces one of the important themes in pattern recognition—lesion localization—by specifying which anatomical structures belong to a certain region (ie, petrous portion of the temporal bone region vs. petrous apex).

The succinct second chapter, only three pages long, is certainly the most personable. The authors describe their own approach to interpreting CT and MRI examinations of the brain, with an emphasis on repetition and creation of template dictations in one's mind. The authors also list common blind spots in neuroradiology and how to avoid the pitfall of satisfaction of search, a valuable lesson for all radiologists.

Chapters 3, 4, and 5 provide a generalized categorization of disease by process and location, outline differential diagnoses by lesion location, and characterize lesion appearance by morphology, respectively. This final chapter in the “brain” section of the text helps compartmentalize and categorize one's understanding of pathologic processes; for instance, by listing the lesions demonstrating diffusion restriction or the various causes of ependymal/subependymal enhancement. The shorter chapters in the “spine” section of the text (Chapters 7–10) follow essentially the same format as the “brain” section.

One of the most outstanding features of this text is the image gallery (Chapters 6 and 11), which encompass nearly two-thirds of the volume. The CT and multisequence/multiplanar MR images are visually pleasing and well annotated. Captions are to the point. The images complement the text portion of the volume and facilitate comprehension of the disease processes outlined in preceding chapters. The authors' sample dictation templates at the end of the volume are highly relevant in clinical day-to-day practice and exemplify the overriding theme of adhering to a routine pattern during image analysis.

I find _Pattern Recognition Neuroradiology_ useful for radiology residents, neurology/neurological surgery residents, neurologists/neurosurgeons, and general practicing radiologists. Neuroradiology fellows and subspecialty trained neuroradiologists may find this text introductory; however, I believe the latter group will certainly appreciate the unique manner in which this material is presented.
