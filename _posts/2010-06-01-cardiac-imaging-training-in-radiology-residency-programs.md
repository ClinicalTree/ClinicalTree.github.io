## Rationale and Objectives

Comprehensive training in cardiac imaging during radiology residency is imperative if radiologists are to maintain a significant role in this rapidly growing field. In this study, radiology chief residents were surveyed to assess the current status of cardiac imaging training in radiology residency programs. The responses to this survey may be helpful in understanding current trends in cardiac imaging training and how such training can be improved in the future.

## Materials and Methods

Chief residents at accredited radiology residency programs were sent an e-mail with a link to a 17-question Web-based survey. The survey assessed the organization of cardiac imaging training in each residency program, imaging modalities incorporated into cardiac imaging training, the role of residents on cardiac imaging rotations, and attitudes of residents about their cardiac imaging training and the future of cardiac imaging.

## Results

Responses were obtained from 52 of 112 (46%) programs. Seventy-one percent had at least one dedicated cardiac imaging rotation during their residencies. Fifty-two percent and 62% of respondents reported <5 hours of cardiac imaging–related case conferences and didactic lectures per year, respectively. Most had cardiac computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging incorporated into their cardiac imaging training. Although 92% felt that cardiac imaging training is important, only 17% felt that they currently received adequate training in cardiac imaging.

## Conclusions

The majority of residency programs represented in this survey had at least one dedicated cardiac imaging rotation for their residents. Most of these programs had few cardiac imaging–related conferences and lectures per year. Although most chief residents believed that cardiac imaging training is important, only a minority felt that they currently received adequate training in cardiac imaging.

Technologic advances in cardiac imaging, including cardiac computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have expanded the role of radiologists in interpreting noninvasive imaging of the heart and coronary arteries . A recent report showed that cardiac imaging currently accounts for approximately 30% of all Medicare-related noninvasive diagnostic imaging and that the use of cardiac imaging is growing faster than that of any other type of noninvasive imaging .

Comprehensive training in cardiac imaging during radiology residency is imperative if radiologists are to maintain a significant role in this rapidly growing field. Levin et al recognized this in their discussion of cardiac imaging “turf wars.” Proposals for advanced cardiovascular imaging training in cardiology fellowship programs amplify the need to vigorously train radiologists in cardiac imaging . Until recently, radiology training in cardiac imaging has been restricted to plain-film radiography, fluoroscopy, and nuclear cardiology. However, many radiology residency programs are now establishing dedicated cardiac imaging rotations to ensure that their trainees develop strong foundations in this field, including training in cardiac CT and MRI .
