## Rational and Objectives

Pulmonary partial pressure of oxygen ( _p_ O  2 ) and oxygen depletion rate ( _R_ ) are two important parameters of lung function. The dependence of hyperpolarized  3 He (HP  3 He) T  1 on local oxygen concentration provides the basis for high-resolution mapping of the regional distributions of _p_ O  2 and _R_ in the lung. Although the oxygen-sensitive HP  3 He magnetic resonance imaging technique has been applied in human subjects and several animal species, reproducibility studies are rarely reported in the literature. This work presents a preliminary reproducibility study on a pig model. In this study, important scan parameters, such as measurement timing and flip angle, are optimized to minimize the noise-induced measurement uncertainty.

## Materials and Methods

In the in vivo study, five normal pigs and one diseased pig with simulated pulmonary emboli were scanned with a small flip angle gradient echo sequence. The pulmonary oxygen measurement was repeated two to four times in each pig. In each measurement, a series of six images were acquired with optimal timing and flip angle. The parametric maps were generated using a bin-based data processing procedure that applied the multiple regression fitting method to extract the _p_ O  2 and _R_ . Variations of global mean, percentiles, and regions of interest were calculated from the maps to analyze reproducibility.

## Results

The global statistical analyses show that average variation of global mean is 10.7% for _p_ O  2 and 23.8% for _R_ , and that the average variation of percentiles (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th) and interquartile range is 14.8% for _p_ O  2 and 30.4% for _R_ . The region-of-interest analysis on the manually selected regions shows that the average variation of mean is 12.6% for _p_ O  2 and 21.9% for _R_ .

## Conclusion

In this work, a preliminary study on the reproducibility of measuring _p_ O  2 and _R_ with HP  3 He magnetic resonance imaging on a pig model is presented.

Pulmonary partial pressure of oxygen ( _p_ O  2 ) and oxygen depletion rate ( _R_ ) are important parameters of lung function. The measurements of _p_ O  2 and _R_ give quantitative information on the efficiency of gas exchange within the lungs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary embolism, and most of the other diseases that affect regional ventilation-perfusion ratios disturb _p_ O  2 and _R_ ( ). Therefore, the accurate measurement of these parameters has the potential to serve as a sensitive marker for the early detection and diagnosis of lung diseases.

Traditionally, _p_ O  2 could only be measured globally from the inspired and mixed expiratory gas, assuming a simple model of lung physiology ( ). In recent years, hyperpolarized  3 He (HP  3 He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been developed as a promising tool for the regional, sensitive, and noninvasive assessment of pulmonary parameters ( ). The application of this technique to pulmonary oxygen measurement has generated considerable interest because high-resolution mapping of regional _p_ O  2 and _R_ distributions not only enhances detection of lung pathologies, but also provides fundamental insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease ( ).

It can be assumed that during the initial period of breathhold when the measurement takes place, _p_ O  2 ( _t_ ) can be approximated as a linear function of time ( ):

In Eq  3 , the normalized signal intensity, _E  n_ , is a linear sum of the three parameters, _ε_ , _p_ 0 , and _R_ , weighted by the associated functions _n_ , _t(n)_ , and _t_ 2 _(n)_ , respectively. Therefore, the multiple regression method can be used to extract the values of _ε_ , _p_ 0 , and _R_ from a single series of acquired images ( ). The analytic uncertainty expression of each parameter in the presence of measurement noise can also be obtained. These expressions provide the basis for comparing the noise performances between different measurement schemes; an optimal scheme that yields minimal measurement uncertainties for _p_ 0 and _R_ can be found from a variety of possible choices.

is the background noise, calculated as an average from a 5 × 5 region at the right-bottom corner of the image where no signal is contained. The second threshold was the pixel inhomogeneity inside a bin. The inhomogeneity was calculated as the ratio of standard deviation of pixel intensities over the average. A bin with an inhomogeneity greater than 0.4 was discarded for fitting. Such bins usually occurred at the edge of the lung, where only a portion of the pixels contained signal and a large signal variation existed.
