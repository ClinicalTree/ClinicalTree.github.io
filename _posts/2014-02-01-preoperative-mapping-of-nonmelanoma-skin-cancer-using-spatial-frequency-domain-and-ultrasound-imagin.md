## Rationale and Objectives

The treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is usually by surgical excision or Mohs micrographic surgery and alternatively may include photodynamic therapy (PDT). To guide surgery and to optimize PDT, information about the tumor structure, optical parameters, and vasculature is desired.

## Materials and Methods

Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) can map optical absorption, scattering, and fluorescence parameters that can enhance tumor contrast and quantify light and photosensitizer dose. High frequency ultrasound (HFUS) imaging can provide high-resolution tumor structure and depth, which is useful for both surgery and PDT planning.

## Results

Here, we present preliminary results from our recently developed clinical instrument for patients with NMSC. We quantified optical absorption and scattering, blood oxygen saturation (StO  2 ), and total hemoglobin concentration (THC) with SFDI and lesion thickness with ultrasound. These results were compared to histological thickness of excised tumor sections.

## Conclusions

SFDI quantified optical parameters with high precision, and multiwavelength analysis enabled 2D mappings of tissue StO  2 and THC. HFUS quantified tumor thickness that correlated well with histology. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the instrument for noninvasive mapping of optical, physiological, and ultrasound contrasts in human skin tumors for surgery guidance and therapy planning.

Nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), which include basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), are the most common human cancer with more than one million cases every year, and the incidence rate has increased dramatically. Although they rarely metastasize, they can present significant morbidity especially for cases in cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face. The standard of care for NMSCs is usually surgical excision or Mohs micrographic surgery. Tumors may show multifocal, widespread disease, and suspicious lesions at deeper locations may be present. Typically, biopsies are performed to guide surgeons but can be time-consuming and costly, and the analyzed sections may not be representative of the whole tumor. After surgical removal of the tumor, there may still be residual tumor at the margins, which can result in high-recurrence rates. Thus, the surgeon needs to decide on how much to excise and how deep to go during surgery. Surgery can benefit from prior knowledge of size and depth for more accurate lesion removal. An imaging tool that can provide guidance and thereby reduce recurrence rates, operation times, cost, and the need for multiple biopsies would be highly desired.

Depth and size information can also provide useful information for selecting the appropriate therapy. Topical 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA)–based photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) has become an attractive treatment option especially for cases with multiple sites and large areas . ALA-PDT uses topical application of the prodrug ALA that is converted into the photosensitizer (PS) protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which is activated by light in the presence of oxygen for local tissue destruction. For superficial NMSCs, ALA-PDT has efficacy close to surgery with sometimes better cosmetic and functional outcomes. However, the efficacy is limited for thicker and deeper tumors . Thus, tumor size information can allow for a better PDT planning.
