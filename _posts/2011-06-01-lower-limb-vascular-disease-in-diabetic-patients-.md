## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively analyze the significance of 3.0-T contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with calf compression in the lower limbs of diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease.

## Materials and Methods

Sixty-one type 2 diabetes patients underwent both MRA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) within 1 week. The patients were divided into two groups: one with (pressure) and one without (conventional) calf compression during MRA. Two radiologists evaluated the quality of MRA images and compared the two groups. Cohen’s kappa statistic was used to determine the concordance between MRA and DSA.

## Results

Image quality in the calf and foot was better in the group with calf pressure than the conventional group without applied pressure ( _P_ = .001 \[calf\], 0.008 \[foot\]). Significantly more runoff vessels in the calf were detected with MRA than with DSA ( _P_ = .0043 \[conventional\], 0.0031 \[pressure\]). The kappa values were 0.928 in the conventional group and 0.979 in the pressure group, but in the conventional group, the diagnostic accuracy of CE-MRA was lower than that of DSA ( _P_ = .002). Diagnostic accuracy in the pressure group was significantly higher than that in the conventional group ( _P_ = .009). The overall sensitivity and specificity for >50% stenosis or occlusion was 93.8% and 98.5%, respectively, in the conventional group and 98.7% and 99.6%, respectively, in the pressure group. With calf compression, venous overlap ( _P_ = .0396, .0425) and deep vein overlap ( _P_ = .022, .022) were significantly reduced in the leg and foot.

## Conclusion

Calf compression with 3.0-T CE-MRA was convenient and practical and could improve image quality and diagnostic accuracy in diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease by reducing venous overlap.

The evolution of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been dramatic. MRA has played a major role in treatment planning and follow-up . The higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) offered by the introduction of the 3.0-T magnetic resonance (MR) system into clinical practice has been confirmed in several studies. In our opinion, 3.0-T contrast-enhanced (CE), four-station, bolus-chase MRA still has limitations in depicting lower extremity and runoff vessels in diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease, particularly in the calf and foot, because of venous overlap.

The risk of developing critical limb ischemia is 11 times higher for patients with diabetes than for those without . Diabetic peripheral vascular disease preferentially involves arteries below the knee, with late involvement of the pedal arteries, and commonly presents as a diffuse, severe, bilateral disease that affects the proximal vessels . A clinical assessment of the arterial tree should include the distal vessel; this assessment may be used as a preoperative preparation for arterial bypass grafts.
