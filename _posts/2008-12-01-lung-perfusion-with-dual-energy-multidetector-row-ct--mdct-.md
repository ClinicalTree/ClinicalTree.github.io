## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the accuracy of dual-energy computed tomography in the depiction of perfusion defects in patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Materials and Methods

One hundred seventeen consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of acute PE underwent dual-energy multidetector computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the chest with a standard injection protocol. Two radiologists evaluated, by consensus, the presence of endoluminal clots on ( ) transverse “diagnostic” scans (contiguous 1-mm-thick averaged images from tubes A and B) and ( ) lung perfusion scans.

## Results

Seventeen patients showed CT features of acute PE, with the depiction of 75 clots within the lobar (n = 15), segmental (n = 43) and subsegmental (n = 17) pulmonary arteries. A total of 17 clots were identified as complete filling defects (ie, obstructive clots), located within segmental (12 of 17) and subsegmental (5 of 17) arteries. Fourteen of the 17 obstructive clots were seen with the concurrent presence of corresponding perfusion defects, whereas cardiac motion and/or contrast-induced artifacts precluded the confident recognition of perfusion abnormalities in the remaining two segments and one subsegment. Four subsegmental perfusion defects were depicted without the visualization of endoluminal thrombi within the corresponding arteries. Perfusion defects were identified beyond five nonobstructive clots.

## Conclusion

Simultaneous information on the presence of endoluminal thrombus and lung perfusion impairment can be obtained with dual-energy computed tomography.

Since the introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography with high spatial and temporal resolution, computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) has become the reference standard for diagnosing acute pulmonary embolism (PE), with sensitivity and specificity varying between 83% and 100% and 89 and 97%, respectively ( ). Although the depiction of endoluminal clots within central pulmonary arteries is an easy task, it may be more difficult to identify filling defects within small-sized pulmonary arteries. This potential limitation of CTA could be theoretically compensated for by the detection of ischemic lung zones beyond the level of obstructive clots, provided both morphologic and functional information can be derived from the same data set. Moreover, despite the availability of high-resolution images of pulmonary arteries, CTA does not allow the analysis of lung perfusion impairment after acute PE, which is especially valuable in patients with underlying respiratory disease.

On the basis of single-source computed tomography, two approaches have been investigated for the detection of perfusion abnormalities, one using color-coded maps of lung density in humans ( ) and the other a subtraction technique using pre- and postcontrast conventional CT images in experimental animal studies ( ). Although both approaches have demonstrated the detectability of perfusion defects on computed tomography, the feasibility of these approaches in clinical practice have substantial limitations pertaining to scanning times and levels of radiation exposure to patients. The recent availability of dual-source computed tomography and the subsequent possibility to scan patients with dual energy offers another alternative for lung functional imaging. Preliminary experiences have shown that this technique could be applied to the analysis of lung perfusion, with radiation doses below the legally required levels ( ). The purpose of this study was to investigate the detectability of perfusion defects with dual-energy computed tomography in the clinical context of acute PE.
