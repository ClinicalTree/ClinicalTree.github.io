## Introduction

Interventional Radiology (IR) was recognized as a primary specialty by the American Board of Medical Specialties in 2012. This led to the development of new training pathways in IR, which have been approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education . Interested candidates may choose to apply for independent or integrated residency positions as the traditional IR fellowship will sundown after the 2019–2020 fellow year . In anticipation of the inaugural residency class utilizing the new pathways beginning in July 2017, there have been many concerns raised regarding the implications this transition will have on residency programs, faculty development, and structural alterations in the field of radiology. Many of these issues have been addressed in recent literature .

One additional concern is the effect the new pathways will have on medical student recruitment . The establishment of a new training format requiring students to decide on a career in IR as a medical student rather than midway through a diagnostic radiology (DR) residency created a heightened sense of urgency to reassess how adequately medical students were being exposed to IR . With declining medical student interest in the field of DR, which reached a nadir in 2015 , concerns about medical student interest in the field of radiology as a whole has led to multiple proposed methods of improving medical student education and awareness of radiology . One common theme among investigators has revolved around the establishment of a radiology interest group (RIG) .

Medical student interest groups foster unique opportunities for students to construct relationships with residents and faculty of their chosen specialty in a non–curricular-based setting. Providing opportunities for leadership roles, service, research projects, and professional networking, interest groups serve as a vehicle for growing student interest and escalating recruitment . Recognizing this, the Interventional Radiology Medical Student Council, through the Society of Interventional Radiology, created an online roadmap of how to start and develop a separate IR interest group . This movement emanated from the paradigm shift acknowledging the distinctiveness of skill sets between IR and DR physicians and the increased emphasis on the clinical management of patients required for IR training . This brings us to the question at hand:

- Is it advantageous to separate IR and DR interest groups or are there benefits to maintaining both specialties under a single organizational umbrella?


The purpose of this perspective is to review our 3-year experience with co-sponsorship of a RIG with DR and IR advisors.
