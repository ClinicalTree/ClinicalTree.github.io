## Rationale and Objectives

Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed in the past two decades to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on breast imaging exams, thus providing a second opinion. Mammographic databases play an important role in the development of algorithms aiming at the detection and diagnosis of mammary lesions. However, available databases often do not take into consideration all the requirements needed for research and study purposes. This article aims to present and detail a new mammographic database.

## Materials and Methods

Images were acquired at a breast center located in a university hospital (Centro Hospitalar de S. João \[CHSJ\], Breast Centre, Porto) with the permission of the Portuguese National Committee of Data Protection and Hospital's Ethics Committee. MammoNovation Siemens full-field digital mammography, with a solid-state detector of amorphous selenium was used.

## Results

The new database—INbreast—has a total of 115 cases (410 images) from which 90 cases are from women with both breasts affected (four images per case) and 25 cases are from mastectomy patients (two images per case). Several types of lesions (masses, calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions) were included. Accurate contours made by specialists are also provided in XML format.

## Conclusion

The strengths of the actually presented database—INbreast—relies on the fact that it was built with full-field digital mammograms (in opposition to digitized mammograms), it presents a wide variability of cases, and is made publicly available together with precise annotations. We believe that this database can be a reference for future works centered or related to breast cancer imaging.

According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer was responsible for approximately 519,000 deaths in 2004: 16% of all cancer incidence among women. In 2008, it was the most common form of cancer and cancer related death in women worldwide . In Portugal, 1500 women die every year from breast cancer, whereas in the European Union it is responsible for one in every six deaths from cancer in women . For this reason, early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer is essential to decrease its associated mortality rate. Therefore, mass screening is recommended by the medical community .

X-ray mammography is currently considered the best imaging method for breast cancer screening and the most effective tool for early detection of this disease . Screening mammographic examinations are performed annually on asymptomatic women to detect early, clinically unsuspected lesions. The age at which mass screening mammography is generally recommended in the United States is 40 . In Europe, screening at 40 to 50 years old is still not consensual . However, in women with genetic mutations or significant family history of breast cancer, screening should start earlier, usually 10 years earlier than the age of diagnosis of the youngest relative (never before 25) .

where T  2 is a saturation value (an alternative approach would be to use a sigmoid function to compress the Euclidean distance). The motivation for this saturation process is that erring by T  2 (eg, 100) is the same as erring by any value above T  2 (eg, 700).
