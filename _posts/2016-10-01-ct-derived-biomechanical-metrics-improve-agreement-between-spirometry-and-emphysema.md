## Rationale and Objectives

Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have marked discordance between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) and degree of emphysema on computed tomography (CT). Biomechanical differences between these patients have not been studied. We aimed to identify reasons for the discordance between CT and spirometry in some patients with COPD.

## Materials and Methods

Subjects with Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages I–IV from a large multicenter study (The Genetic Epidemiology of COPD) were arranged by percentiles of %predicted FEV  1 and emphysema on CT. Three categories were created using differences in percentiles: Cat  spir with predominant airflow obstruction/minimal emphysema, Cat  CT with predominant emphysema/minimal airflow obstruction, and Cat  matched with matched FEV  1 and emphysema. Image registration was used to derive Jacobian determinants, a measure of lung elasticity, anisotropy, and strain tensors, to assess biomechanical differences between groups. Regression models were created with the previously mentioned categories as outcome variable, adjusting for demographics, scanner type, quantitative CT-derived emphysema, gas trapping, and airway thickness (model 1), and after adding biomechanical CT metrics (model 2).

## Results

Jacobian determinants, anisotropy, and strain tensors were strongly associated with FEV  1 . With Cat  matched as control, model 2 predicted Cat  spir and Cat  CT better than model 1 (Akaike information criterion 255.8 vs. 320.8). In addition to demographics, the strongest independent predictors of FEV  1 were Jacobian mean (β = 1.60,95%confidence intervals \[CI\] = 1.16 to 1.98; _P_ < 0.001), coefficient of variation (CV) of Jacobian (β = 1.45,95%CI = 0.86 to 2.03; _P_ < 0.001), and CV of strain (β = 1.82,95%CI = 0.68 to 2.95; _P_ = 0.001). CVs of Jacobian and strain are both potential markers of biomechanical lung heterogeneity.

## Conclusions

CT-derived measures of lung mechanics improve the link between quantitative CT and spirometry, offering the potential for new insights into the linkage between regional parenchymal destruction and global decrement in lung function in patients with COPD.

## Introduction

The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently based on the detection of airflow obstruction by spirometry . It is increasingly recognized that airflow obstruction as measured by impairment in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) does not fully explain the morbidity associated with the disease, and this functional definition can be complemented by anatomic measures of disease using widely available imaging modalities . Computed tomography (CT) has become the gold standard in the quantitative assessment of the presence and distribution of emphysema, a major component of COPD, and relies on using a fixed Hounsfield threshold value below which all lung areas are deemed emphysematous in a CT scan obtained at full inspiration . CT measures of emphysema correlate well with pathology , and numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between spirometry and CT emphysema . The agreement between CT emphysema andspirometry is however not perfect, and in some cases, CT densitometry may be more sensitive than spirometry in detecting emphysema .

It is our observation that many patients with COPD have marked discordance between FEV  1 and degree of emphysema on volumetric CT . Some subjects with severe airflow obstruction have mild emphysema on CT and conversely, some patients with severe emphysematous destruction of the lung have relatively mild spirometric impairment. Although some of these differences, especially in the former group, are likely due to airway narrowing, the reasons for this discrepancy between expected changes on spirometry and CT have not been systematically studied, particularly in the disproportionate emphysema group. Because airflow obstruction is due to a combination of airway narrowing and loss of elastic recoil due to emphysema, it is possible that static single-volume CT images do not capture lung mechanics sufficiently to explain lung function defects. We hypothesized that biomechanical measures of regional lung tissue expansion and contraction using image registration applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans will provide a link between CT-derived quantitative measures and spirometry. Through a demonstration of this link, we seek to provide an improved understanding of patient-specific links between the presence and distribution of quantitative emphysema and airflow obstruction.
