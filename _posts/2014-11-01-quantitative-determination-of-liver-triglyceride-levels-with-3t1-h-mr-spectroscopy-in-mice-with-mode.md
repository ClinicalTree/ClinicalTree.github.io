## Rationale and Objectives

To diagnose hepatic steatosis with noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR)–based measurements, threshold values of liver fat percentages are used. However, these differ between studies. Consequently, the choice of threshold values influences diagnostic accuracy, especially in subjects with borderline hepatic steatosis. In this study, we compared  1 H-MR spectroscopy (MRS) and biochemically determined liver fat content in mice with moderately elevated fat content and studied the diagnostic accuracy of  1 H-MRS using two literature-based threshold values.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty mice were divided into three groups: 21 C57Bl/6OlaHSD (B6) mice on a high-fat diet, 20 B6 mice on a control diet, and 9 LDLr−/− mice on a high-fat high-cholesterol diet.  1 H-MRS was performed using multi-echo STEAM at 3T to derive a fat mass fraction (  1 H-MRS fat content). Biochemical fat content was determined from liver homogenates. Correlation and agreement were assessed with the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Bland–Altman analysis and diagnostic accuracy by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.

## Results

All mice were pooled to form a single cohort. Mean (±standard deviation) biochemical fat content was 32.2 (±13.9) mg/g. Mean  1 H-MRS fat content did not differ at 30.2 (±12.0) mg/g ( _P_ = .13). Correlation _r_ was 0.74 ( _P_ < .0001). Bland–Altman analysis indicated that  1 H-MRS fat content underestimated biochemical fat content by 2.1 mg/g. The diagnostic accuracy of  1 H-MRS depended to a great extent on the chosen reference threshold value.

## Conclusions

1 H-MRS measurement of moderately elevated liver fat content in mice correlated substantially with biochemical fat content measurement. Contrary to earlier studies, diagnostic accuracy of  1 H-MRS fat content in borderline liver fat content appears limited.

With the global obesity epidemic reaching epic proportions, the number of people with fatty change of the liver—also referred to as hepatic steatosis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)—will rise too . In clinical practice, staging of steatosis on liver biopsy is the reference standard for assessing the amount of liver fat. However, this invasive method is rapidly being overtaken by other noninvasive reproducible measures that include ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and  1 H-MRS .

Magnetic resonance (MR)–derived measurements of liver fat are usually expressed as ratios between fat and water signal values. However, current threshold values based on MRI and  1 H-MRS for diagnosing “steatosis” differ between studies, field strengths, and populations targeted. For example, the widely used threshold of 5.6% first described by Szczepaniak et al. was found by defining the 95th percentile as threshold value for normal versus elevated in a healthy subgroup ( _n_ = 345) of a large cohort. In that study, no histologic or biochemical reference standard was used to define steatosis, and the authors refer to an earlier publication by Hoyumpa et al. stating that the normal liver contains <5.0% w/w fat. In turn, however, those authors do not refer to other studies to back up this statement. The few studies that have investigated biochemical composition of liver tissue give considerably lower values for normal liver fat content ranging from 0.6% to 1.94% w/w . Even so, the 5.6% threshold value has become a much reported reference value. In a recent study by Tang et al. —which compared the MRI-based proton density fat fraction (PDFF) with biopsy-determined steatosis levels—a 6.4% PDFF threshold was found to optimally distinguish between grade 0 and grade 1 or higher on liver biopsy. The PDFF is the MR signal fat fraction corrected for T  1 and T  2 bias with, at this threshold value, sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 100%. It is important to note that although  1 H-MRS and PDFF measure signal ratios—which correspond nearly one-on-one with volume ratios—these are different metrics than the 5% of hepatocytes-containing fat vacuoles on histology.
