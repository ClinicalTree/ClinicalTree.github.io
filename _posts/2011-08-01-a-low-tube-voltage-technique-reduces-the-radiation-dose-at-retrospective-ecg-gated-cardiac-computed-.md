## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of low-tube-voltage technique on a cardiac computed tomography (CT) for coronary arterial and cardiac functional analyses and radiation dose in slim patients.

## Materials and Methods

We enrolled 80 patients (52women, 28 men; mean age, 68.7 ± 8.9 years) undergoing retrospective electrocardiogram-gated 64-slice cardiac CT. Forty were subjected to the low (80-kV) and 40 to the standard (120-kV) tube-voltage protocol. Quantitative parameters of the coronary arteries (ie, CT attenuation, image noise, and the contrast-to-noise ratio \[CNR\]) were calculated, as were the effective radiation dose and the figure of merit (FOM). Each coronary artery segment was visually evaluated using a 5-point scale. Cardiac function calculated by using low-tube-voltage cardiac CT was compared with that on echocardiographs.

## Results

CT attenuation and image noise were significantly higher at 80- than 120-kV ( _P_ < .01). CNR of the left and right coronary artery was 18.4 ± 3.8 and 18.5 ± 3.3, respectively, at 80 kV; these values were 19.7 ± 2.7 and 19.8 ± 2.8 at 120 kV; the difference was not significant. The estimated effective radiation dose was significantly lower at 80 than 120 kV (6.3 ± 0.6 vs. 13.9 ± 1.1 mSv, _P_ < .01) and FOM was significantly higher at 80 than 120 kV ( _P_ < .01). At visual assessment, 99% of the coronary segments were diagnostic quality; the two protocols did not differ significantly. We observed a strong correlation and good agreement between low-tube-voltage cardiac CT and echocardiography for cardiac functional analyses.

## Conclusion

Low-tube-voltage cardiac CT significantly reduced the radiation dose by approximately 55% in slim patients while maintaining anatomical image quality and accuracy of cardiac functional analysis.

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) using multidetector CT (MDCT) yields high diagnostic accuracy for the evaluation of coronary artery stenosis and cardiac function . However, the widespread use of cardiac CT raises concerns with respect to radiation exposure. At 64-slice MDCT, the radiation exposure is high; it ranges from 11–15 mSv to 21 mSv for the coronary artery and from 14 to 26 mSv for coronary bypass graft studies with an extended scan length. To minimize the patient dose, conventional electrocardiogram (ECG)-dependent tube current modulation is used; at 37–40%, the savings from this technique are moderate . Another recently-implemented low-dose CT technique is prospective “step-and-shoot” ECG triggering. This technique allows for a radiation dose reduction of 77–79% . However, it requires a regular, low heart rate, which may not be obtainable in all patients, and the evaluation of cardiac function is not possible because images are acquired during end-diastole only. Strategies for reducing the radiation dose for anatomical and functional analyses at cardiac CT involve lowering the tube voltage. The use of a low-tube-voltage technique drastically reduces the radiation dose and effectively increases contrast enhancement . However, with the low-tube-voltage technique, the transmitted radiation is decreased and image noise is increased; this may constitute a disadvantage in clinical practice where diagnostic image quality must be maintained. To our knowledge, the effects of the low-tube-voltage technique on anatomical and functional analyses at cardiac CT have not been adequately assessed.

We investigated the effects of low-tube-voltage retrospective ECG-gated cardiac CT on qualitative and quantitative image quality parameters and the radiation dose in slim patients by comparing low- (80 kV) and standard tube-voltage settings (120 kV).
