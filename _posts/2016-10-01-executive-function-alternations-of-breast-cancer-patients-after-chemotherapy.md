## Rationale and Objectives

Chemotherapy has many side effects on breast cancer patients, including cognition and other brain functions impairment, which can be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our study aimed at investigating the executive function alternations of breast cancer patients after chemotherapy using resting-state fMRI.

## Materials and Methods

This study included 32 breast cancer patients (BC group) and 24 control subjects (HC group). The functional connectivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the two groups was calculated from the resting-state fMRI data, and the correlation between the strength of the right DLPFC's connectivity and the behavior performance was analyzed with two-tailed Pearson correlative analysis.

## Results

Evaluation of the capability of processing various complex cognition events showed that the executive function of the BC group was impaired after chemotherapy in comparison with the HC group. The functional connectivities of the right DLPFC with the right inferior frontal gyrus, right medial frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus in the BC group were significantly decreased in comparison with those in the HC group, respectively. The executive deficits were found correlated with the functional connectivity between the right DLPFC and the right inferior frontal gyrus. Meantime, the functional connectivity from the right DLPFC to the right middle temporal gyrus and the precuneus was compensatorily increased in the BC group, respectively.

## Conclusions

These findings suggest that breast cancer patients after chemotherapy demonstrate executive control impairment, and provide evidence that the observed defects are correlated with alternations in the executive network of the brain.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women . Most of the patients diagnosed of breast cancer are treated with surgery and combined with chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. However, with the increase of survival probability, the side effects of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy are reported frequently . Chemotherapy is commonly applied in cancer treatment; nevertheless, its central nervous system toxicity affects long-term quality of life .

Chemotherapy influences the central nervous system possibly through triggering cell death, increasing oxidative stress and microglia activity, suppressing hippocampal neurogenesis, and decreasing the neurotrophic factors and hippocampal catecholamines . Previous studies indicate that breast cancer patients show cognitive impairments after chemotherapy, particularly in the capability of memory, attention, executive controlling, and information processing . The executive function mainly includes information processing, problem solving, planning, and execution . Central executive network, which is responsible for the executive function, mainly involves the frontal lobe and part of the parietal and temporal lobes . The prefrontal cortex (PFC) comprises the frontal part of the frontal lobe and connects several neocortical areas that send and receive projections from almost all of the cortical sensory systems, motor systems, and numerous subcortical structures . Clinical neuropsychologic trials indicate that the PFC plays a central role in the cognitive control behavior. Correspondingly, patients with PFC damage show impaired judgment, organization, and decision-making capability, as well as neuropsychologic disinhibition and intellectual difficulties .
