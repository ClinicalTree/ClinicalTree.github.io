We thank Dr. Satoh and colleagues for their interest in our article and their comments about our study. Our article presents a retrospective analysis of our cohort of screen-detected lung cancers, which comes with all the limitations of a retrospective study. For example, we did not have repeat computed tomography (CT) scans in all cases to actually measure the growth rate; these were only available in 63 of the 86 cancers. We did not perform a prospective analysis of lesions detected on low-dose screening CT scans, and as such are not able to give a correct estimate on the overall number of cancers with a long doubling time; this was not the target of our study. As such, our numbers might not be comparable with the numbers from other centers, which were acquired based on different methods.
