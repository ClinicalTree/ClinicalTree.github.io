## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to do a meta-analysis of the existing literature to assess the accuracy of prostate cancer (PCa) studies that use contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a diagnostic tool.

## Materials and Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant original articles published up to August 2012. Characteristics of Included studies were recorded. Methodological quality was assessed by using the quality assessment of diagnostic studies tool. Pooled weighted estimates of diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR) were calculated. A summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve was constructed to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). Publication bias analysis was also performed.

## Results

Sixteen studies (2624 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Various contrast agents and imaging modes were applied. The independent random-effects summary showed a variation in diagnostic values. The summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and DOR were 0.70, 0.74, and 9.09, respectively. The weighted positive and negative LR were 2.81 and 0.35, with statistically significant between-study heterogeneity ( _P_ < .001). Sensitivity was better in positive patient studies than positive biopsy cores ones (0.78 vs. 0.64). SROC plot displayed value for AUC (0.82). Begg's test ( _P_ = .822) and Egger's test ( _P_ = .198) did not show evidence of publication bias.

## Conclusion

CEUS is a promising tool in the detection of PCa, but it cannot completely replace systematic biopsy under the present circumstances. It is necessary to standardize imaging techniques, contrast agents and diagnostic criteria. Large samples, multi-center studies and high-quality prospective trials are necessary to assess its clinical value.

## Introduction

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in males. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2012 PCa will account for 29% of new cancer diagnoses in men and 9% of cancer-related deaths in the United States . Early detection is the key to successful treatment. Digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen, conventional transrectal ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging have been the main methods for detecting PCa. These methods are available but the diagnosis of PCa is far from optimal . Grayscale transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy is the reference standard method, however, it has been shown that this approach missed clinically relevant cancers. Autopsy studies have demonstrated that sensitivity of sextant prostate biopsy was 30%, with increasing sensitivity with increasing numbers of biopsy cores, 36%–58% for 12-core biopsies, and 53%–58% for 18-core biopsies . PCa is multifocal and heterogeneous in nature, making it difficult to detect all cancers, sites, and grades . Thus, new techniques that help us to display more cancerous lesions and to target areas of high cancer incidence are desirable.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging was developed to real-time image perfusion . Ultrasound contrast agents consist of small encapsulated gas bubbles that are administered intravenously and remain intravascular. Adding microbubbles as additional reflectors into the bloodstream increase the sensitivity of imaging. Numerous studies have been performed to assess the diagnostic performance of CEUS in the evaluation of prostate lesions . These studies yield varying estimates of sensitivity and specificity, which are probably caused by advances in technology, differences in scan protocols, and heterogeneity in patient populations. The purpose of our study, therefore, was to perform a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the literature to determine the overall diagnostic value of CEUS for PCa.
