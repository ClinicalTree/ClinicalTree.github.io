## Purpose

To evaluate the performance of T2 star-weighted angiography (SWAN) to concomitantly assess the prostate contour while detecting fiducials before magnetic resonance (MR)-based intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma.

## Materials and Methods

Forty patients (mean age: 73.1 ± 7.5 years; average Gleason score: 7 ± 1; average prostate-specific antigen: 14.7 ± 11.6 ng/mL) underwent MR and computed tomography imaging before fiducial-based IMRT. MR protocol included SWAN, T2-weighted (T2w) and diffusion-weighted imaging in a first group ( _n_ = 20) and SWAN, T2w and T2-star weighted imaging in a second group ( _n_ = 20). In group 1, the depiction of fiducials, image sharpness and visibility of prostate boundaries were independently evaluated by 2 readers on SWAN, T2w or diffusion-weighted images. In group 2, a similar evaluation was performed by 2 other readers on SWAN and T2-star images only. Depiction of fiducials was compared to computed tomography findings.

## Results

The median scores of visibility of prostate boundaries, image sharpness and depiction of fiducials by SWAN were above average to excellent for all readers. In group 1, readers correctly located 56 of 57 (98.2%) and 47 of 57 (82.5%) fiducials, respectively; and 50 of 51 (98%), and 48 of 51 (88.2%) fiducials in group 2, respectively.

## Conclusion

By allowing adequate visualization of the prostate boundaries and high depiction of fiducial markers concomitantly, SWAN might be used for treatment planning of IMRT. The use of this sequence might simplify the registration process and limit any errors associated with image fusion.

## Introduction

Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in prostate carcinoma may potentially improve outcomes by creating sharp borders confining high dose to the prostate and leading to spare the surrounding organs . However, IMRT requires improved evaluation of the prostatic gland to individually determine the optimal treatment plan . To overcome the traditional limitations of computed tomography (CT)-based IMRT workflow, fiducial markers have been used to enable landmark-based alignment of magnetic resonance images (MRI) to the planning CT images . This CT-MR combination allows accurate registration and mapping of the prostate contour, leading to accurate dose delivery.

The MR protocol performed before MR-based IMRT usually includes a T2 star-weighted sequence helping to identify the fiducials as well as a pT2-weighted (T2w) sequence to delineate the prostate contour . Multi-echo gradient-recalled echo (GRE) T2 star-weighted imaging provides better detection of implanted fiducial markers when compared to both fast spin-echo and single-echo GRE T2w imaging but gives relatively poor anatomic localization . To address these both priorities in the same sequence, T2 star-weighted angiography (SWAN) is highly sensitive to differences in magnetic susceptibility and provides a clear, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) dataset, integrating a broad range of distinct tissue contrasts allowing to visualize anatomic structures . SWAN applies a multi-time-to-echo readout technique that generates a high signal-to-noise ratio and appears less affected by the chemical shift compared to other susceptibility-weighted imaging techniques. Moreover, SWAN helps to delineate small blood vessels, microbleeds, and large vascular structures but also iron and calcium deposits, as reported in the brain . We hypothesized that MR protocols including SWAN might permit accurate MR-based treatment planning by allowing both visualization of the whole prostate anatomy and the fiducials . The aim of this preliminary study was therefore to evaluate the performance of SWAN to concomitantly assess the prostate contour while detecting fiducials before MR-based IMRT in prostate carcinoma.
