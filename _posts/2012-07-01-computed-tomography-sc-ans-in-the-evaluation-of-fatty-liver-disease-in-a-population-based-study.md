## Rationale and Objectives

Fatty liver disease is a common clinical entity in hepatology practice. This study evaluates the prevalence and reproducibility of computed tomography (CT) measures for diagnosis of fatty liver and compares commonly used CT criteria for the diagnosis of liver fat.

## Materials and Methods

The study includes 6814 asymptomatic participants from a population-based sample. The ratio of liver-to-spleen (L/S) Hounsfield units (HU) <1.0 and liver attenuation <40 HU were used for diagnosing and assessing the severity of liver fat content. Participants with heavy alcohol intake (>7 drinks/week for women and >14 drinks/week for men) were excluded. Final analysis was performed on participants where images of both liver and spleen were available on the scans.

## Results

The overall prevalence of fatty liver (4175 subjects included in final analysis) was 17.2% (using L/S ratio <1.0), with 6.3% (with <40 HU cutoff) of the population having moderate to severe steatosis (>30% liver fat content). The prevalence was high in participants with dyslipidemia (70.4%), hypertension (56.8%), and obesity (53%). Diabetic patients had 24.1% prevalence of fatty liver. The prevalence provided by L/S ratio <1.0 (17.2%) was comparable to prevalence provided by <51 HU (17.3%), whereas prevalence obtained by <40 HU (6.3%) cutoff corresponded to L/S ratio of <0.8 (6.5%). The measurements of liver and spleen HU attenuations were highly reproducible (0.96, 0.99 and 0.99, 0.99 for intra- and inter-reader variability, respectively) in a sample of 100 scans.

## Conclusion

Fatty liver can be reliably diagnosed using nonenhanced CT scans.

Fatty liver is hepatic manifestation of a number of medical conditions and medication use . With the increasing epidemic of obesity in the United States and worldwide, fatty liver is increasingly being diagnosed . One special category is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which represents the accumulation of triglyceride droplets in the hepatocytes in the absence of significant alcohol intake. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of clinical entities that includes simple steatosis that may progress to steatohepatitis . All of these entities include an accumulation of fat in the hepatic parenchyma . NAFLD with steatosis alone is a relatively inconsequential clinical entity; however, its clinical significance is increased by its association with cardiovascular disease . Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a subtype of NAFLD characterized by hepatocytes ballooning and necrosis with or without Mallory's hyaline and fibrosis on histological analysis that carries the risk of progressive liver disease and cirrhosis . The diagnosis of NAFLD is associated with shorter survival than expected for a general population of the same age and gender . NAFLD has been shown to be associated with insulin resistance and is considered a part of the metabolic syndrome . Studies are also looking at the association of NAFLD with inflammatory markers and subclinical atherosclerosis, evaluating its associations beyond the liver .

Population-based studies have shown varying prevalence of NAFLD ranging from 3% to 46% based on varying diagnostic modalities used and the patient population characteristics . Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography can show characteristic features of fatty liver but the ultimate diagnosis requires liver biopsy . Liver biopsy shows the presence of fatty changes along with any associated inflammation and fibrosis. It is an invasive procedure with its associated complications sometimes requiring hospitalization and significant bleeding. It may not be a suitable test to determine the presence of a widely prevalent condition in an asymptomatic population. CT scans have proven to be useful in diagnosing the presence and quantifying the severity of liver fat noninvasively. The Hounsfield unit (HU) attenuation of liver on CT scans is usually higher than the spleen; when this ratio is reversed, this can be used to diagnose the presence of liver fat . Liver-to-spleen ratio (L/S) <1.0 can be used effectively to diagnose the presence of liver fat . Studies have also shown liver HU attenuation <40 HU to reliably represent >30% of liver fat content . The current study looks at the prevalence and reproducibility of measurement of liver fat content using nonenhanced CT scans in a large well-validated population based cohort of asymptomatic participants using previously published criteria for liver fat measurement . We will also compare commonly used criteria mentioned (L/S ratio and liver HU attenuation) in the literature for the diagnosis of NAFLD.
