## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the effects of 1 year of medical treatment on myocardial function in active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-nine female patients with RA without any known cardiovascular disease underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) examination before and after 1 year of antirheumatic treatment. The population comprised untreated active early RA (ERA) and chronic RA patients, who were grouped accordingly. The CMR protocol included volumetric determinations, late gadolinium enhancement imaging, myocardial tagging, and native T1 mapping. DAS28-CRP disease activity scores were calculated before and after the treatment.

## Results

Results are reported as median (quartile 1–quartile 3). Time to peak diastolic filling rate improved in ERA (495 \[443–561\] ms vs 441 \[340–518\] ms, _P_ = .018). Peak diastolic mean mid short-axis circumferential strain rate of all six segments was improved (82 \[74–91\] %/s vs 91 \[77–100\] %/s, _P_ = .05), particularly in the anterior segment (82 \[63–98\] %/s vs 86 \[77–109\] %/s, _P_ = .013). DAS28-CRP decreased in ERA (3.8 \[3.2–4.1\] vs 1.6 \[1.4–2.2\], _P_ < .001). In chronic RA, no statistically significant improvement was detected.

## Conclusions

Early treatment of active RA is important, as myocardial function detected with CMR tagging improved in ERA in parallel with decreasing inflammatory activity.

## Introduction

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with common and often subclinical cardiovascular involvement . The mechanisms of myocardial disease in RA are not fully understood, but higher prevalence of myocardial fibrosis, diastolic dysfunction, or heart failure with normal ejection fraction has been documented . The prevalence of heart failure with normal ejection fraction in patients with RA has been reported to be as high as 23% and the prevalence of predominant diastolic dysfunction to be even higher (31%–66%) . Cardiac involvement is assumed to result from a combination of processes, such as chronic inflammation leading to endothelial dysfunction, and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines that lead to the development of myocardial dysfunction . A major contributor to reduced life expectancy in RA patients is coronary heart disease and heart failure . Therefore, early detection of myocardial changes in RA is crucial to ensure early therapeutic intervention.

Global left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular filling parameters measured with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can be insensitive for the detection and assessment of early changes in myocardial contractility and relaxation . The myocardial contractility and relaxation use strain as a measure of myocardial deformation, and this approach can be assessed with strain echocardiography or CMR tagging. Tagging is considered as the gold standard for noninvasive deformation imaging . Global circumferential strain assessed by CMR can identify myocardial dysfunction for several conditions that are independent of left ventricular ejection fraction . Recently, global circumferential strain has been shown to have an independent prognostic value in both asymptomatic patients and those with heart failure . For noninvasive evaluation of diffuse myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, native T1 mapping has become a promising CMR tool. Decreased native T1 values have been identified in myocardial iron overload states or glycosphingolipid accumulation in Anderson-Fabry disease, whereas high native T1 values have been related to myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, amyloid accumulation, and other conditions . The influence of active RA and the effects of medical treatment with synthetic and biological disease modifying drugs (DMARDs) were our area of interest in this 1-year follow-up study.
