## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the imaging features and histological and clinical outcomes of a series of suspicious, mammographically occult breast lesions detected at 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

Approval was obtained from the institutional review board. A Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant retrospective review was performed of 121 suspicious, mammographically occult lesions detected on 3.0 T contrast-enhanced breast MRI. All 121 lesions underwent histological sampling. Radiology and clinic reports were reviewed for patient demographics, MRI indication and findings, biopsy and localization details, histological results, and follow-up information. Positive predictive value (PPV) of biopsy recommendations were calculated and compared for screening versus diagnostic cases. Likelihood of malignancy was also compared with lesion size. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and two-tail z-tests.

## Results

Overall 43 malignancies were diagnosed from 121 suspicious, mammographically occult 3.0 T MRI-detected lesions. Seventy-eight (64%) of the 121 were benign. The overall PPV of 3.0 T MRI-detected lesions was 36% (43/121). The PPV for biopsy in the screening setting (22% \[10/45\]) was statistically significantly less ( _P_ = .018) compared to the PPV of a biopsy recommendation in the diagnostic setting (43% \[33/76\]). There was no correlation between lesion size and the likelihood of detecting malignancy.

## Conclusion

Our PPV of suspicious, mammographically occult, breast lesions detected at 3.0 T breast MRI is similar to the PPV reported previously for suspicious breast lesions detected at 1.5 T. This study supports the use of 3.0 T breast MRI for both screening and diagnostic breast imaging.

Contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging tool for the detection of breast cancer based on improved contrast resolution over other imaging modalities . The American College of Radiology (ACR) practice guidelines for contrast-enhanced breast MRI include screening patients at high risk of developing breast cancer, evaluating extent of disease in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer, monitoring response of biopsy-proven breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and evaluating patients with metastatic axillary adenocarcinoma of unknown primary . Prior studies report clinical outcomes of suspicious, mammographically occult, MRI-detected breast lesions ; however, most of these studies evaluated lesions detected at 1.0 and 1.5 T imaging . Today, higher field strength, namely 3.0 T, MRI systems are becoming increasingly common in clinical settings . These higher field strength 3.0 T systems offer the potential for improved resolution compared to lower field strength systems . However, there are limited data describing the use of high-field strength 3.0 T MRI for breast imaging , and 1.5 T remains the clinical standard.

At our institution, contrast-enhanced breast MRI has been routinely performed on 3.0 T scanners for 5 years. This retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the imaging features and histological and clinical outcomes in a series of suspicious, mammographically occult, 3.0 T MRI-detected breast lesions.
