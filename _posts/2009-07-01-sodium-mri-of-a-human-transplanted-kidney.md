## Rationale and Objectives

Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys has been used to spatially map areas of sodium-concentrating activity and to quantify the corticomedullary sodium gradient in various physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions. In this case study, sodium MRI of a clinically well-functioning transplanted kidney was performed to determine whether its sodium gradient could be detected and quantified using this method.

## Materials and Methods

Sodium MRI was performed on a 3T scanner with a commercial rectangular sodium surface coil placed on the lower abdomen over the palpable transplanted kidney. A three-dimensional gradient echo sequence, modified for multinuclear imaging, was applied to acquire  23 Na images.

## Results

Five main renal pyramids within the medulla were detected, and the corticomedullary sodium gradient was quantified in each renal pyramid by both region of interest–based and pixel-by-pixel analyses, resulting in a mean medulla/cortex signal-to-noise ratio of 1.8 ± 0.1 ( _n_ = 5) and a mean linear increase slope of 1.1 ± 0.1 relative arbitrary units per mm ( _n_ = 5).

## Conclusions

The feasibility and usability of  23 Na MRI of a human renal allograft was demonstrated. Further studies are required to determine the clinical significance of this technique in the follow-up of patients after renal transplantation.

Sodium magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive tool to map the sodium spatial distribution in the imaged organ and has been described for various targeted applications . In the kidney, sodium MRI may have a unique role since a well functioning kidney will maintain a corticomedullary sodium gradient to keep body fluids and electrolytes in homeostasis .

In recent years, there have been several reports of using  23 Na MRI to noninvasively measure the corticomedullary sodium gradient in animal models . It has been shown that the sodium gradient measured by  23 Na MRI was linear, and sensitive to physiologic and pathophysiologic changes as diuresis , hydronephrosis , and acute tubular necrosis .

The transplanted kidney is clearly observed against the abdominal wall, showing the high-intensity medullary areas in the renal parenchyma. Data were acquired using a sodium surface coil and applying a three-dimensional gradient echo sequence tailored for sodium imaging with repetition time/echo time = 30/1.8 ms (partial Fourier echo), field of view = 38 × 38 × 24 cm, matrix = 128 × 128 × 16. (b) A coronal reconstruction of the cropped three-dimensional renal parenchyma, summed into a single coronal slice (using the inherent image processing tools of the scanner). This view facilitates the three-dimensional spatial localization of the main medullary areas.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SodiumMRIofaHumanTransplantedKidney/0_1s20S1076633209000385.jpg)

The observed increase in sodium SNR along the corticomedullary axis was linear (in this example r 2 > 0.99). The error bars are based on the uncertainties present from the SNR measured at each point.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SodiumMRIofaHumanTransplantedKidney/1_1s20S1076633209000385.jpg)
