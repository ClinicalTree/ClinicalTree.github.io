_High Resolution CT of the Chest_ , a comprehensive atlas in its third edition, is primarily intended for residents, chest fellows, pulmonologists, practicing diagnostic, and chest radiologists helping illustrate the characteristic features of diseases afflicting the airways and pulmonary parenchyma. This hard cover text contains 13 chapters on chest disease in pictorial essay form. The aim of the text is to focus on a thorough review of the chest literature in summary form with a pictorial essay of the spectrum of abnormalities that may be seen in any given chest disease entity.

The 13 core sections are as follows: Intro to high-res CT, airway and lung anatomy, large airways disease, bronchiectasis, small airways disease, cystic lung diseases, obstructive lung diseases, lung transplant and lung volume reduction surgery, diffuse lung diseases, asbestos-related diseases, masses, infectious pneumonia, and AIDS-related diseases. This atlas has been updated from the second edition (2000) to include up-to-date text and many new images. The simplicity of learning high resolution chest CT in pictorial essay form helps the reader navigate through the text with ease. The text below each disease entity and image is succinct, but sufficient for core understanding of the core sections. I particularly enjoyed the sections on cystic lung diseases, lung transplant, and AIDS-related diseases because the authors break down and review the spectrum of abnormality of difficult topics with ease and beautiful simplicity.

I find _High-Resolution CT of the Chest_ extremely useful for practicing radiologists, chest fellows, pulmonologists, and radiology residents looking to brush up on chest CT radiology knowledge and acquire the most pertinent knowledge in preparation for general practice. The image quality and overall short discussions of each disease entity are excellent and without perceived errors. I enjoyed reading through the captions and browsing through the images in each section and I feel using a pictorial review atlas in chest CT helps retain information better than more comprehensive texts, because is usually too much information to digest and remember in one sitting. As residents and practicing radiologists, we need more “to the point” and quickly searchable information, which this text does a great job of providing. An added bonus of purchasing the atlas is that it includes easy online access to the fully searchable text via a special code found on the inside cover of the atlas. After you purchase this text, it is always with you online if that is the route you choose to learn and read (via computer or mobile device).

_High-Resolution CT of the Chest_ is an excellent pictorial review atlas. This simplified way of learning allows for the rapid development of understanding and refreshing core high-resolution chest CT disease knowledge. The third edition of the atlas is rather complete and therefore also a resource that radiologists can continue to refer to for a better understanding of high-resolution chest CT.
