## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiac computed tomographic angiography algorithms emphasize radiation reduction while maintaining diagnostic image quality (IQ). The aim of this study was to evaluate IQ and interreader variability using prospective electrocardiographically triggered high-pitch spiral cardiac computed tomographic angiography (FLASH-CT) compared to retrospective electrocardiographic gating (RETRO-CT) for coronary artery disease evaluation in a patient population including overweight and obese individuals.

## Materials and Methods

Seventy patients (24 women; mean age, 60 years) matched for gender, age, body mass index (27.4 ± 5.5 kg/m  2 ), and calcium score (184 ± 328) underwent cardiac computed tomographic angiography, 35 with FLASH-CT (Definition Flash) and 35 with RETRO-CT (Somatom Definition). Images were reconstructed using standard protocols and least motion phase for RETRO-CT acquisitions. Two independent, blinded readers evaluated the coronary arteries using an 18-segment model, grading IQ on a 5-point, Likert-type scale and coronary stenosis on a 5-point semiquantitative and binary scale.

## Results

Effective radiation dose (1.50 vs 17.3 mSv, _P_ < .0001) and mean heart rate (58 vs 62 beats/min, _P_ < .05) were significantly lower for FLASH-CT compared to RETRO-CT. Seven hundred forty segments (>1.5 mm) were evaluated. There was no significant difference between FLASH-CT and RETRO-CT scans in overall per-segment IQ (3.11 ± 0.75 vs 3.10 ± 0.82, _P_ = .94). FLASH-CT had noninferior IQ relative to RETRO-CT (95% confidence interval, −0.25 to 0.26). There was no significant difference in interreader variability in diagnosis between FLASH-CT and RETRO-CT for all coronary segments (77.5% vs 78.2%, _P_ = .83).

## Conclusions

FLASH-CT is an acceptable coronary computed tomographic angiographic method for reducing radiation dose without compromising IQ for a patient population including overweight and obese individuals.

Cardiac computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CCTA) is a reliable, noninvasive technique for evaluating coronary artery disease (CAD) . Although the noninvasive nature of CCTA is ideal, the associated radiation exposure of standard cardiac CT angiographic techniques should be minimized and continually monitored. In a recent multicenter, multivendor trial, the median effective radiation dose was 12 mSv for retrospective electrocardiographic gating techniques, with doses exceeding 30 mSv for some sites .

Novel cardiac CT angiographic algorithms focus on methods for radiation reduction while maintaining diagnostic image quality (IQ). Prospective electrocardiographically triggered axial CCTA (step-and-shoot mode) is one algorithm that reduces radiation exposure by limiting tube current to predefined time points of the cardiac cycle while keeping the table stationary at each station. This method has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with mean effective radiation doses of 1.2 to 4.3 mSv, depending on the patient’s heart rate, scanner specifications, and total time of radiation exposure .
