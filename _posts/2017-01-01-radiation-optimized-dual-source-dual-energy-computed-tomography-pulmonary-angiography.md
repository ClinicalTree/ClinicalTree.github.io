## Objectives

This study aimed to intra-individually and inter-individually compare image quality, radiation dose, and diagnostic accuracy of dual-source dual-energy computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) protocols in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Methods

Thirty-three patients with suspected PE underwent initial and follow-up dual-energy CTPA at 80/Sn140 kVp (group A) or 100/Sn140 kVp (group B), which were assigned based on tube voltages. Subjective and objective CTPA image quality and lung perfusion map image quality were evaluated. Diagnostic accuracies of CTPA and perfusion maps were assessed by two radiologists independently. Effective dose (ED) was calculated and compared.

## Results

Mean computed tomography (CT) values of pulmonary arteries were higher in group A than group B ( _P_ = .006). There was no difference in signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio between the two groups (both _P_ > .05). Interobserver agreement for evaluating subjective image quality of CTPA and color-coded perfusion images was either good (κ = 0.784) or excellent (κ = 0.887). Perfusion defect scores and diagnostic accuracy of CTPA showed no difference between both groups (both _P_ > .05). Effective dose of group A was reduced by 45.8% compared to group B ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Second-generation dual-source dual-energy CTPA with 80/Sn140 kVp allows for sufficient image quality and diagnostic accuracy for detecting PE while substantially reducing radiation dose.

## Introduction

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) ranks as the third most common cardiovascular condition, after coronary artery disease and stroke . Due to the nonspecific clinical symptoms, imaging plays an important role in detection and follow-up of acute PE . Currently, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is considered the reference standard in diagnosis of acute PE . Dual-energy CTPA is capable of providing anatomic, perfusion, ventilation, and pulmonary vascular tree information for the whole lung, which makes it an important tool for comprehensive evaluation of PE .

With the application of dual-energy computed tomography (CT) in the lungs, diagnostic accuracy for acute and chronic PE, as well as other vascular disorders such as lung malignancies and parenchymal diseases, has been improved . Compared to routine single-energy CTPA, dual-energy CTPA showed advantages in detecting small peripheral PE . With concerns regarding radiation risk, the clinical use of CTPA has increasingly come into focus. Thieme et al. indicated that according to the European guidelines on quality criteria for CT, the radiation dose with first-generation dual-source dual-energy CTPA (80/140 kVp) is lower than the reference value of 650 mGy⋅cm. With the development of second-generation dual-source CT, multiple scanning parameters of dual-source dual-energy CTPA, such as 80/Sn140 kVp and 100/Sn140 kVp, can be selected. Recently, Bauer et al. demonstrated that second-generation dual-energy CT with 80/Sn140 kVp allowed for significant dose reduction with the same image quality compared to 120 kVp CTPA. However, this study did not include an intra-individual comparison and did not analyze lung perfusion images. Both Thieme et al. and Bauer et al. provide important information for the diagnosis and prognosis evaluation of PE . Thus, further studies seem warranted to expand on these aspects. The purpose of this study was to intra-individually and inter-individually compare image quality, radiation dose, and diagnostic accuracy of dual-energy CTPA with the two different scanning parameters, and determine the optimized scanning protocols for dual-energy CTPA in clinical routine.
