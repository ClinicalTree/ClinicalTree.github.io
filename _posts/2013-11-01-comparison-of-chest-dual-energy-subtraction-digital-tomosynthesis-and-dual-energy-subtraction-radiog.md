## Rationale and Objectives

To compare initial evaluations of chest dual-energy subtraction digital tomosynthesis (DES-DT) and dual-energy subtraction radiography (DES-R) for detection of pulmonary nodules.

## Materials and Methods

DES-DT and DES-R systems with pulsed x-rays and rapid kV switching were used to evaluate pulmonary nodules (>4–6 mm, 2 nodules; >6–8 mm, 2 nodules; >8 mm, 32 nodules). Multidetector computed tomography was used as a reference. A filtered back-projection algorithm was used to reconstruct low-voltage (60 kVp), high-voltage (120 kVp), and soft-tissue or bone-subtracted tomograms of the desired layer thicknesses from the image data acquired during a single tomographic scan. DES-R images were processed from the low- and high-voltage images. To detect the pulmonary nodules, we used both systems to examine 36 patients with and 36 patients without pulmonary nodules. Two radiologists and three doctors of pulmonary medicine (average experience, 18 years) performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the results.

## Results

The ROC analysis results suggested that the detection ability was significantly better for DES-DT than for DES-R ( _P_ < .0001; 95% confidence interval: DES-DT, 0.94 \[0.83–0.99\]; DES-R, 0.76 \[0.68–0.85\]; sensitivity: DES-DT, 87.7 ± 2.9%; DES-R, 53.8 ± 3.5%; specificity: DES-DT, 78.3 ± 5.6%; DES-R, 78.4 ± 3.4%; accuracy: DES-DT, 83.1 ± 3.8%, DES-R, 66.1 ± 2.0%). When the nodules were no longer superimposed over the normal structures, their characteristics and distribution could be observed much more clearly.

## Conclusion

Compared with DES-R, DES-DT provided greater sensitivity for detection of pulmonary nodules, particularly for the larger ones.

Lung cancer is currently the primary cause of cancer death, and the incidence continues to increase worldwide. Because of its high sensitivity, normal-dose helical computed tomography (CT) is currently considered the gold standard for lung cancer detection. Previous studies have shown that low-dose helical CT could detect early-stage lung cancer, thereby decreasing morbidity . CT is advantageous because it is not susceptible to the problem of reduced accuracy resulting from overlapping anatomy. However, CT has disadvantages, such as higher radiation doses and costs compared with chest radiography. The advantages of chest radiography include short examination time, low cost, and easy access; however, low sensitivity and specificity are its main disadvantages. In chest radiography, a three-dimensional view of the chest is projected onto a two-dimensional image; therefore, for many analyses, detection of pathological findings is limited by overlapping anatomy rather than quantum noise. Chest radiography has been shown to have relatively low sensitivity for detection of pulmonary nodules. This poor sensitivity precludes its use as a screening method despite its low cost, low dose, and the widespread availability of radiographic devices.

Digital tomosynthesis (DT) imaging has been shown to provide greater contrast than radiography for images of similarly sized nodules. Three recent studies found that the detectability of pulmonary nodules was considerably higher with chest DT than with chest radiography; in one report, sensitivity was found to be increased, particularly for nodules smaller than 9 mm . Another study reported that DT is an advantageous technique for detecting pulmonary nodules . DT was also shown to have considerably improved sensitivity for detection of known small lung nodules in three size groups (<5, 5–10, and >10 mm) relative to that of chest radiography . According to these reports, DT was better than radiography for detection of lung nodules.
