## Purpose

To evaluate stent lumen visualization by combining high-resolution cardiac kernel and the iterative reconstruction (iDose) on an anthropomorphic moving heart phantom and in patients at coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.

## Materials and Methods

We used the moving heart phantom and a 64 detector-row CT, retrospectively gated helical scanning, and image reconstruction. The heart rate was set at nonpulsating condition of 0 beats/min, 50 beats/min, and 80 beats/min. The 120-kV images were reconstructed in synchronization with electrocardiogram data using filtered back projection (FBP) or iDose algorithm and standard kernel/filter (CB) or high-resolution kernel/filter (CD). We measured image noise, the kurtosis, and stent lumen diameter in the phantom study. We also assessed the visual inspections by two radiologists.

## Results

With cardiac motion at 50 and 80 beats/min, the difference of kurtosis improved with CD relative to CB ( _P_ < .05). iDose algorithm with level 7 provided lowest noise, with no statistically significance in difference of the kurtosis relative to level 4 ( _P_ \> .05). Without cardiac motion at 0 beats/min, the stent lumen diameter measurements with CD kernel were better relative to CB kernel ( _P_ < .05). In addition, no significant difference was found in stent lumen diameter between iDose level 4 and level 7 ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusion

The use of iDose and a sharp kernel allowed improved stent visualization at a lower radiation dose.

Multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with electrocardiogram (ECG) gating is an accurate noninvasive method to evaluate coronary artery disease . Additionally, current multidetector CT facilitates the reliable detection of in-stent stenosis compared to earlier generations of scanners . However, the issue of overestimating the actual degree of stenosis from blooming artifacts persists . The blooming effect on coronary CT angiographs is attributable to beam hardening; stent struts appear thicker than they are and they often overlap the vessel lumen . Therefore, the assessment of coronary artery stent patency is compromised by blooming artifacts. Compared to the standard reconstruction kernel, the high-resolution cardiac kernel reduces these artifacts and improves visualization of coronary artery stents although image noise is increased as spatial resolution is improved .

The new “iterative reconstruction algorithm (iDose)” involves two denoising components, an iterative maximum likelihood-type sinogram restoration method based on Poisson noise distribution and a local structure model fitting on image data that iteratively decreases uncorrelated noise . Therefore, iDose reduces noise with a limited effect on spatial resolution.

1 = poor, indicating that no clinical information could be obtained because the stent lumen and stent skeleton could not be identified because of severe artifacts; 2 = fair, indicating that the stent lumen was assessable but partially obscured because of moderate artifact, yielding insufficient information because in-stent patency was indeterminate; 3 = good, indicating that the stent skeleton was demonstrated with some degradation in the image quality because of small artifacts, yielding acceptable clinical information; 4 = excellent, indicating that the full length of the stent lumen was clearly assessable, artifacts were slight, and the clinical information yielded was very useful.
