## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the feasibility of using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with an array spatial sensitivity encoding technique (ASSET) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map values with different b values to distinguish benign and malignant breast lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-six female patients with 60 histologically proven breast lesions and 20 healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging. A subset of normal volunteers ( _n_ = 7) and patients ( _n_ = 16) underwent both conventional DWI and ASSET-DWI, and the image quality between the two methods was compared. Finally, ASSET-DWI with b = 0, 600 s/mm  2 , and b = 0, 1000 s/mm  2 , were compared for their ability to distinguish benign and malignant breast lesions.

## Results

The ASSET-DWI method had less distortion, fewer artifacts, and a lower acquisition time than other methods. No significant difference ( _P_ \> .05) was detected in ADC map values between ASSET-DWI and conventional DWI. For ASSET-DWI, the sensitivity of ADC values for malignant lesions with a threshold of less than 1.44 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s (b = 600 s/mm  2 ) and 1.18 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s (b = 1000 s/mm  2 ) was 80% and 77.5%, respectively. The specificity of both groups was 95%.

## Conclusion

ASSET-DWI evaluation of breast tissue offers decreased distortion, susceptibility to artifacts, and acquisition time relative to other methods. The use of ASSET-DWI is feasible with b values ranging from 600 to 1000 s/mm  2 and provides increased specificity compared to other techniques. Thus, the ADC value of a breast lesion can be used to further characterize malignant lesions from benign ones.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is becoming an essential tool for examination of breast cancer tissue; compared to ultrasound and mammography, it has remarkably high sensitivity due to the use of contrast enhancement material . Recent multicenter trials have established that dynamic gadolinium contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MR) has high sensitivity (>90%) and moderate specificity (∼85%) . Some benign lesions exhibit contrast characteristics that are similar to those of malignant lesions (eg, fibroadenomas) . Therefore, increasing the specificity is a challenge for breast MRI and other imaging methods.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a specific type of MRI. Diffusion is a physical phenomenon that differs from conventional parameters, such as T1 and T2. The principle that underlies DWI is that the thermal motion of the water molecules in the extracellular fluid enables the acquisition of an image that reflects both histological structure and cellularity. DWI is sensitive to changes in the micro-diffusion of water within the intra- and intercellular environments . After an event that has caused a disruption or restriction of the flow of water within a tissue, such as ischemic events (eg, stroke) or tumor growth, cytotoxic edema occurs and results in changes in the diffusion of water within the tissue . These changes in the diffusion of water result in changes in the signal intensity on the DWI (either hyperintensity or hypointensity) . DWI also provides a quantitative biophysical parameter called the apparent diffusion coefficient of water (ADC) map. The ADC map is an indicator of the movement of water within the tissue. It gives an average value of the flow and the distance that a water molecule has moved, and it has been related to the state of tissue during the evolution of cerebral ischemia and tumor progression .
