## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of detecting a fatty liver after binge drinking in an animal model using  1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  1 H-MRS), dual-energy computed tomography (DECT), biochemistry, and the gold standard of histology.

## Materials and Methods

In 20 inbred female Lewis rats, an alcoholic fatty liver was induced; 20 rats served as controls. To simulate binge drinking, each rat was given a dose of 9.3 g/kg body weight 50% ethanol twice, with 24 hours between applications. Forty-eight hours after the first injection, DECT and  1 H-MRS were performed. Fat content as well as triglycerides were also determined histologically and biochemically, respectively. To assess specific liver enzymes, blood was drawn from the orbital venous plexus.

## Results

In all 20 animals in the experimental group, fatty livers were detected using  1 H-MRS, DECT, and biochemical and histologic analysis. The spectroscopic fat/water ratio and the biochemical determination were highly correlated ( _r_ = 0.892, _P_ < .05). A significant correlation was found between  1 H-MRS and histologic analysis ( _r_ = 0.941, _P_ < .001). Also, a positive linear correlation was found between the dual-energy computed tomographic density of ΔHU and the biochemical ( _r_ = 0.751, _P_ < .05) and histologic ( _r_ = 0.786, _P_ < .001) analyses.

## Conclusions

Quantification of hepatic fat content on  1 H-MRS showed high correlation with histologic and biochemical steatosis determination. In comparison to DECT, it is more suitable to reflect the severity of acute fatty liver.

Binge drinking is a modern form of drinking alcoholic beverages with the primary intention of becoming intoxicated through heavy consumption of alcohol . A standardized conceptual definition of binge drinking was proposed by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in 2004: a “binge” is a pattern of drinking alcohol that elevates the blood alcohol content to ≥0.08 g%. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming five or more drinks for men, or four or more drinks for women, in about 2 hours , whereby according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a standard drink is defined as 0.6 fluid ounces of pure alcohol.

Especially among young people, binge drinking is often regarded as a fun, social activity, with little thought given to the health effects that may follow, and it accounts for a large proportion of all alcohol-related deaths, which makes it an increasingly important topic in alcohol research. In 2004 in the European region, alcohol-attributable deaths in men (11.0%) and woman (1.8%) were above average. Aftereffects were neuropsychiatric disorders, cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis, and cancer . Another study reported that in 2008 in Germany, approximately 25,700 children, teenagers, and adults (aged 10–20 years) had been in hospitals for acute alcohol intoxication, an 11% increase since 2007 and a 170% increase since 2000 .
