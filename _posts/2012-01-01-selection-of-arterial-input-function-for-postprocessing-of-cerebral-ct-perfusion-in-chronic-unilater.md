## Rationale and Objectives

We evaluated the effect of the arterial input function (AIF) on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) in patients with unilateral high-grade stenosis or occlusion in the carotid artery or middle cerebral artery without acute stroke.

## Materials and Methods

CTP datasets were retrospectively postprocessed using the same venous output function and different AIF selections: the second segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A2 AIF), the second segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) on the lesion side (affected M2 AIF), and M2 on the contralateral side (nonaffected M2 AIF). We measured CTP values in the region of interest (ROI) in the bilateral MCA territory and evaluated the lesion-to-contralateral ratios.

## Results

The mean and standard deviations of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on the normal side were similar to previously reported data only when using “non-affected M2 AIF.” Selecting an “affected M2 AIF” overestimated the CBF and shortened the mean transit time (MTT) in normal and lesion areas. Selecting an “A2 AIF” may cause overestimation of CBF in the normal side in patients with nonaffected-side A1 hypoplasia or occlusion. The sensitivity of the CBF ratio or MTT ratio to detect these unilateral cerebrovascular diseases was 100% using “nonaffected M2 AIF for bilateral MCA ROIs” and 70% (CBF ratio) and 90% (MTT ratio) using “respective AIF.”

## Conclusion

The use of “nonaffected AIF for the bilateral MCA ROIs” was found to be the best of these AIF-ROI combinations in patients with chronic unilateral carotid or M1 severe stenosis or occlusion.

Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) has been used successfully as a functional imaging technique for patients with cerebrovascular disease. It allows rapid qualitative and quantitative evaluation of cerebral perfusion by generating maps of parameters such as cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), and time to peak (TTP). In CTP, the first passage of a bolus of contrast agent through brain tissue is monitored. Often, quantification of CBF and MTT requires measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) . One may obtain different quantitative results when different arteries are chosen for the AIF. The AIF is optimally selected in one unaffected vessel that is perpendicular to the acquisition plane, which may be one of the anterior cerebral arteries (ACAs) or the contralateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) . Wintermark et al found that AIF selection had no significant influence on MTT and CBF values in ischemic territories in patients with a hemispheric stroke of less than 48 hours’ duration and that the ACA is an appropriate AIF for CTP processing in patients with acute stroke. Kamath et al found that the CBF value obtained with each vascular territory’s own AIF (respective AIF) on CTP correlated best with positron emission tomography (PET) CBF in patients with chronic cervical carotid artery occlusion.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different AIFs in the postprocessing of perfusion in patients with chronic high-grade unilateral arterial stenosis or occlusion without acute infarction. In addition, we examined whether the ACA and respective AIF would be appropriate for the postprocessing of perfusion data in these patients.
