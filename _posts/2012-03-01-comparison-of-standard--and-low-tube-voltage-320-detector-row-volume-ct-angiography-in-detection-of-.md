## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the effect of low–tube voltage (80 kVp) 320–detector row volume computed tomographic (CT) angiography (L-VCTA) in the detection of intracranial aneurysms, with three-dimensional (3D) spin digital subtraction angiography (DSA) as the gold standard.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-eight patients with clinically suspected subarachnoid hemorrhages were divided into two groups. One group underwent L-VCTA and DSA, while the other group underwent conventional–tube voltage (120 kVp) volume CT angiography (C-VCTA) and DSA. Vascular enhancement, image quality, detection accuracy of aneurysms, and radiation dose were compared between the two groups.

## Results

For objective image quality, the L-VCTA group had higher mean vessel attenuation, correlated with higher image noise and lower signal-to-noise ratio, than the C-VCTA group. For subjective image quality, there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding scores for arterial enhancement, depiction of small arterial detail, interference of venous structures, and overall image quality scores. The mean effective dose for the L-VCTA group was significantly lower than for the C-VCTA group (0.56 ± 0.25 vs 1.84 ± 0.002 mSv), with a reduction of radiation dose of 69.73%. With 3D DSA as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in the L-VCTA and C-VCTA groups were 94.12%, 100%, 94.4% and 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. In both groups, there were significant correlations for maximum aneurysm diameter measurements between volume CT angiography and 3D DSA; no statistical difference in the mean maximum diameter of each aneurysm was measured between volume CT angiography and 3D DSA.

## Conclusions

L-VCTA is helpful in detecting intracranial aneurysms, with results similar to those of 3D DSA, but at a lower radiation dose than C-VCTA.

It has been reported that the incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in the general population is between 7% and 10%, with 30-day case fatality of about 43% to 67% . Prompt detection and evaluation of intracranial aneurysms is critical for appropriate endovascular or neurosurgical intervention for patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages. Currently, three-dimensional (3D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered the “gold standard” for the detection of intracranial aneurysms , but the technique is invasive, time consuming, demanding of technical skill, and relatively expensive, and it carries a risk for neurologic complications of up to 1% to 2.3% (even in patients without vascular disease), which that can lead to permanent deficits in up to 0.5% .

Hence, there has been increasing interest in investigating noninvasive alternatives for the accurate detection of intracranial aneurysms. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive technique and can be easily performed with a single bolus intravenous injection of contrast medium, allowing the rapid evaluation of patients with suspected intracranial aneurysms in the acute setting.
