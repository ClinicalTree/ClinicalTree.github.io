## Rationale and Objectives

In recent years, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has emerged as a high-resolution modality for vascular exploration _in vivo_ . Several x-ray contrast agents for _in vivo_ imaging are on the market and are based on different formulations. The objective of this study was to compare contrast-related and pharmacokinetic properties of a water-soluble compound containing iomeprol (Iomeron 400) and blood-pool agents (eXIA160XL, AuroVist 15 nm, and ExiTron nano 12000) for the identification of suitable _in vivo_ vascular imaging applications.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-four healthy C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Iomeprol was administered with a continuous infusion protocol; the other agents as a bolus. Anatomical micro-CT was applied at the head, neck, and lower hind limb before (baseline) and immediately after contrast injection, and used to quantify contrast-related properties of the agents. Dynamic micro-CT was applied at the same regions to characterize the agents pharmacokinetics.

## Results

All contrast media revealed safe, except for eXIA160XL, which caused death in four of eight tested animals and was therefore excluded early from the study. AuroVist 15 nm provided the highest attenuation (2.33/mm) as compared to iomeprol (1.97/mm) and ExiTron nano 12000 (1.58/mm) and a maximum temporal variation of contrast of 20% after 30 minutes, but the appearance of a dark skin staining did not allow multiple injections of the agent. Iomeprol passively diffused across capillary membranes, and after 30 minutes doubled the tissue contrast with respect to its initial levels. ExiTron nano 12000 revealed temporal variations of contrast below 10% and significantly reduced clearance rates after the third consecutive injection.

## Conclusion

AuroVist 15 nm is best suited for anatomical investigation of the vascular network, while the high extravasation levels of iomeprol can be exploited for perfusion analysis. ExiTron nano 12000 is indicated for use in longitudinal monitoring with repeated injections.

_In vivo_ micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a unique imaging modality that demonstrates great abilities for noninvasive time-lapsed imaging of small animals, which allows monitoring of biological processes over time. In recent years, the use of micro-CT for _in vivo_ imaging has experienced a substantial growth, thanks to its abilities to provide anatomical information in great detail . The high x-ray attenuation properties of hard tissues make micro-CT an accurate imaging technique to visualize bone and its microstructure , whereas blood vessels cannot be distinguished from surrounding soft tissues because of their similar densities. To overcome this limitation, contrast agents of radiopaque materials have been developed to image the vascular network. _In vivo_ micro-CT, with the use of vascular contrast agents, is commonly employed as an anatomical imaging modality. In anatomical imaging, vessels are segmented from the surrounding tissues through threshold-based image processing procedures. To provide a high level of anatomical detail, high resolutions (currently around 10–20 μm) are typically used for vessel visualization and morphometric evaluation . The recent shortening of scan times has enabled micro-CT use not only for anatomical investigation, but also for dynamic imaging modality. Dynamic imaging consists of time-lapsed monitoring of a region of interest through consecutive short micro-CT scans. In this case, low resolutions (around 60–70 μm) are used to allow short imaging times. The evaluation of dynamic images often relies on the analysis of density, rather than on vessel segmentation. In density analysis, masks of areas of interest are defined and changes in the average x-ray attenuation of these regions are quantified in a time-lapsed fashion. Taking advantage of density analysis, dynamic imaging has been used to monitor time-dependent processes—for instance, to track the pharmacokinetics of vascular tracers and for perfusion analysis . Therefore, micro-CT shows great potential in assessing both anatomical and kinetic properties of contrast agents in high resolution.

Several contrast media for vascular imaging are currently available on the market. Depending on their formulation, they can be distinguished between water-soluble agents, typically used in the clinics, and blood-pool agents for preclinical imaging. Water-soluble agents are based on organically bound iodine. Iodine provides the highest x-ray attenuation among nonmetal elements and has been used in clinical radiology for decades because of its low toxicity. These agents are based on the tri-iodinated benzene ring, either in an ionic or nonionic form. An ionic form called diatrizoate was introduced in 1954 and is known under the commercial name of Hypaque (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ). However, the high extracellular distribution volumes of this ionic compound were later found to be responsible for adverse reactions and chemotoxicity .
