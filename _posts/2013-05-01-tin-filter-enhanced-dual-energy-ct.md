## Objectives

To measure and compare the objective image quality of true noncontrast (TNC) images with virtual noncontrast (VNC) images acquired by tin-filter–enhanced, dual-source, dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) of upper abdomen.

## Materials and Methods

Sixty-three patients received unenhanced abdominal CT and enhanced abdominal DECT (100/140 kV with tin filter) in portal-venous phase. VNC images were calculated from the DECT datasets using commercially available software. The mean attenuation of relevant tissues and image quality were compared between the TNC and VNC images. Image quality was rated objectively by measuring image noise and the sharpness of object edges using custom-designed software. Measurements were compared using Student two-tailed _t_ -test. Correlation coefficients for tissue attenuation measurements between TNC and VNC were calculated and the relative deviations were illustrated using Bland-Altman plots.

## Results

Mean attenuation differences between TNC and VNC (HU  TNC − HU  VNC ) image sets were as follows: right liver lobe −4.94 Hounsfield units (HU), left liver lobe −3.29 HU, vena cava −2.19 HU, spleen −7.46 HU, pancreas 1.29 HU, fat −11.14 HU, aorta 1.29 HU, bone marrow 36.83 HU (all _P_ < .05); right kidney 0.46 HU, left kidney 0.56 HU, vena portae −0.48 HU and muscle −0.62 HU (nonsignificant). Good correlations between VNC and TNC series were observed for liver, vena portae, kidneys, pancreas, muscle and bone marrow (Pearson's correlation coefficient ≥0.75). Mean image noise was significantly higher in TNC images ( _P_ < .0001). Measurements of edge sharpness revealed no significant differences between VNC and TNC images ( _P_ = .19).

## Conclusion

The Hounsfield units in VNC images closely resemble TNC images in the majority of the organs of the upper abdomen (kidneys, liver, pancreas). In spleen and fat, Hounsfield numbers in VNC images are tend to be higher than in TNC images. VNC images show a low image noise and satisfactory edge sharpness. Other criteria of image quality and the depiction of certain lesions need to be evaluated additionally.

The idea of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has existed since the invention of CT . However, only recently CT technology has advanced far enough to enable dose-neutral DECT acquisitions . Material differentiation in DECT is based on the dependence of photo absorption on energy and atomic number. If CT data that were acquired with different energies are available, a differentiation of the effective atomic numbers of the scanned materials and thus a differentiation of materials with different atomic numbers is feasible . Besides other possible technical approaches, dual-source CT with its two x-ray tubes can supply two simultaneous CT acquisitions with different energy levels . The energetic difference between the two spectra can be enhanced using a tin filter . The filter leads to a sharpening of the high-energy spectrum and thus a higher mean energy level of this spectrum and more effective dual energy discrimination. Thus, it is possible to use of 100 kV instead of 80 kV to create the lower energy spectrum that leads to an improved image quality of the low-energy images especially in the abdomen . Several clinical applications of DECT have recently been investigated . Because of the high atomic number of iodine, the amount of iodine contributing to every voxel can be quantified in DECT datasets using a three-material decomposition algorithm . Thus, the iodine content can be subtracted from the contrast enhanced images, resulting in virtual noncontrast (VNC) images.

Nonenhanced scans can be of interest for the measurement of contrast uptake of lesions, for imaging metabolic changes of liver tissue, and for the detection of calcifications, hematoma, and hemorrhagic cysts. However, because the unenhanced scan is not necessary in many patients, many radiology centers tend to abstain from acquiring the additional images for reasons of dose reduction. Unfortunately, once contrast is administered, the acquisition of noncontrast image is no longer possible in a reasonable time interval, which can hamper the interpretation of incidental findings.
