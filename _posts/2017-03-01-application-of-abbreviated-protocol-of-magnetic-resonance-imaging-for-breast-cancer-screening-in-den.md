## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of an abbreviated protocol (AP) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in comparison to a full diagnostic protocol (FDP) of MRI in the breast cancer screening with dense breast tissue.

## Materials and Methods

There are 478 female participants with dense breast tissue and negative mammography results, who were imaged with MRI using AP and FDP. The AP and FDP images were analyzed separately, and the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer detection were calculated. The chi-square test and receiver operating characteristics curves were used to assess the breast cancer diagnostic capabilities of the two protocols.

## Results

Sixteen cases of breast cancer from 478 patients with dense breasts were detected using the FDP method, with pathologic confirmation of nine cases of ductal carcinoma in situ, six cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, and one case of mucinous carcinoma. Fifteen cases of breast cancer were successfully screened using the AP method. The sensitivity showed no obvious significant difference between AP and FDP (χ  2 = 0.592, _P_ = 0.623), but the specificity showed a statistically significant difference (χ  2 = 4.619, _P_ = 0.036). The receiver operating characteristics curves showed high efficacy of both methods in the detection of breast cancer in dense breast tissue (the areas under the curve were 0.931 ± 0.025 and 0.947 ± 0.024, respectively), and the ability to diagnose breast cancer was not statistically significantly different between the two methods.

## Conclusions

The AP of MRI may improve the detection rate of breast cancer in dense breast tissue, and it may be useful in efficient breast cancer screening.

## Introduction

Breast cancer, the most common or second most common cancer in women worldwide , has gradually gained prevalence. Early detection of breast cancer can improve the duration of survival and quality of life in patients . Extensive screening can detect breast cancer early, thus screening plays an increasing important role in breast care. Mammography (MG) is the preferred method of screening for breast tissue because it is simple, convenient, affordable, and irreplaceable in the detection of microcalcifications . Studies have shown that, within groups of the same age, there are two to six times higher risk of breast cancer in dense breasts than in non-dense breasts, but MG detection sensitivity in dense breasts is much lower than that in fatty breasts . For example, Mendelson et al. found that the detection rate of breast cancer using MG was only 30% in dense breasts and 80% in fatty breasts . This clearly shows a limitation of using MG in breast screening.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has outstanding soft tissue resolution and multiplanar imaging capability, thereby offering unique advantages in the detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. The American College of Radiology (ACR) included breast MRI in the fourth edition of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) in 2003. The use of MRI has been standardized in breast examination . Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), a more advanced technique for breast MRI, allows an analysis of breast lesions through both morphologic and hemodynamic changes, with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of up to 97% for breast cancer detection . However, the lengthy inspection time and high medical cost incurred by DCE-MRI have limited its use in breast MRI screening. Currently, it is used as a supplementary examination of certain breast cancers in high-risk populations .
