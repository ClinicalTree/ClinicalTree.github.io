## Rationale and Objectives

As a component of the practice-based core competency of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, all radiology residents must receive training to be able to evaluate and improve their patient care practices. To achieve this goal, our quality management section has implemented a comprehensive elective rotation in quality assurance.

## Materials and Methods

We have designed a month-long structured resident elective in radiology quality assurance at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School. This elective provides a combination of didactic teaching, self-learning, and practical experience in the methodology, workings, and clinical applications of quality assurance as these relate to improving technical and clinical performance in a large academic radiology department.

## Results

During this rotation, residents are exposed to the spectrum of commonly used tools and techniques used for performance improvement related to the practice of radiology. By actively participating in department and hospital quality assurance (QA) committee meetings, and through initiation of a mentored project coupled with didactic instruction, residents are exposed first hand to the practice and role of continuous quality monitoring and to the implementation and monitoring of action items.

## Conclusion

Participation in our QA elective provides our residents with a comprehensive exposure to the spectrum of quality-related problems, and equips them with the necessary tools to resolve many of the clinical or technical problems they are likely to encounter in their future careers. It is thus an appropriate tool to instruct residents in the competency of “practice-based learning and improvement.”

Quality assurance (QA) is now widely recognized as an essential process for improving clinical and technical operations in radiology departments ( ). We anticipate that our performance as radiologists will be more closely monitored and linked to defined quality metrics and benchmarks. In some academic centers, radiologist performance-based assessments have been introduced ( ) to monitor diagnostic and procedural performance metrics. It is likely that individual radiologist performance will be tied in with assignment of hospital privileges, incentive systems, and accreditation ( ).

Mentored training of residents and fellows in the basic principles of QA and quality improvement (QI) are now mandated by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) ( ). (Please see  Appendix I for glossary of terms.) As an essential core component of the curriculum for all graduate medical education training programs, residents are expected to receive training in the basic principles of QA. Furthermore, for residency programs to be accredited by the ACGME, a functioning QA process must actively exist in the department, and trainees should participate in this process ( ). As a component of the ACGME practice-based learning and improvement competency (competency #3), trainees must be able to evaluate their patient care practices, appraise, and assimilate scientific evidence and improve their patient care practices ( ).
