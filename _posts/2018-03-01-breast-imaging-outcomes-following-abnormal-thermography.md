## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to determine the outcome of patients presenting for evaluation of abnormal breast thermography.

## Materials and Methods

Following Institutional Review Board approval, retrospective search identified 38 patients who presented for conventional breast imaging following a thermography-detected abnormality. Study criteria included women who had mammogram and/or breast ultrasound performed for evaluation of a thermography-detected abnormality between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015. Patients whose mammograms and ultrasounds were initiated at an outside institution or who did not have imaging at our institution were excluded. Records were reviewed for clinical history, thermography results, mammogram and/or ultrasound findings, and pathology. Mammograms and ultrasounds were prospectively interpreted by one of 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act–certified breast imaging radiologists with 3–30 years of experience. Patient outcomes were determined by biopsy or at least 1 year of follow-up. Patient ages ranged from 23 to 70 years (mean = 50 years).

## Results

Ninety-five percent (36 of 38) of patients did not have breast cancer. The two patients diagnosed with breast cancer had suspicious clinical symptoms including palpable mass and erythema. No asymptomatic woman had breast cancer. Negative predictive value was 100%. Of 38 patients, 79% (30 of 38) had Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 1 or 2 assessments; 5% (2 of 38) had BI-RADS 3; and 16% (6 of 38) had BI-RADS 4 ( _n_ = 5) or BI-RADS 5 ( _n_ = 1) assessments. Two of six patients with biopsy recommendations were diagnosed with breast cancer (Positive predictive value 2 = 33.3%). All findings recommended for biopsy were ipsilateral to the reported thermography abnormality.

## Conclusions

No cancer was diagnosed among asymptomatic women. The 5% of patients diagnosed with cancer had co-existing suspicious clinical findings. Mammogram and/or ultrasound were useful in accurately characterizing patients with abnormal thermography.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Screening mammography is the most thoroughly researched and widely utilized examination for breast cancer detection. Screening mammography has repeatedly been shown to contribute to decreased breast cancer–associated mortality . Supplemental screening with ultrasound, tomosynthesis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are performed as clinically indicated, especially for higher risk women; these imaging modalities have all demonstrated effectiveness and safety in the detection of breast cancer. However, patients may seek alternative breast cancer screening methods such as breast thermography. Less is known about the efficacy of thermography for breast cancer detection. Breast thermography was originally developed in the late 1950s in Canada . Thermography was implemented as a breast cancer screening study in the 1960s. In 1977, Feig et al. compared mammography and thermography screening in 16,000 women and found thermography to have a sensitivity of 39% . Based on this low sensitivity, Feig concluded that thermography was not practical as a breast cancer screening tool. Following the results of the study by Feig, breast thermography was largely abandoned .

Since that time, thermal imaging technology has improved and breast thermography is regarded as an adequate method for breast cancer screening in some medical communities, which describe it as offering earlier breast cancer diagnosis relative to conventional imaging modalities and clinical examinations . Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved thermography as a stand-alone modality for breast cancer screening or diagnosis , patients concerned with mammographic radiation or compression may seek thermography in lieu of screening mammography.

![Figure 1, ( a ) Breast thermography image from a 33-year-old female. The reported thermography abnormality was a “hyperthermic, complex, and vascular-like pattern in the cranial left breast” (seen as areas of yellow, orange, and red in the contour of the upper left breast). This is the thermography abnormality that prompted the patient to present for evaluation with conventional breast imaging. ( b ) The patient's left mediolateral oblique mammogram was negative. Focused ultrasound of the upper left breast was negative, as seen in ( c ). No cancer was detected at 3 years of follow-up.
