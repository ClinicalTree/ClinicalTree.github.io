## Rationale and Objectives

To explore whether the sarcopenia body type can help predict response to interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective cohort study of 75 subjects with metastatic RCC who underwent pretreatment contrast-enhanced computed tomography within 1 year of initiating IL-2 therapy. Cross-sectional area and attenuation of normal-density (31–100 Hounsfield units \[HU\]) and low-density (0–30 HU) dorsal muscles were obtained at the T11 vertebral level. The primary outcome was partial or complete response to IL-2 using RECIST 1.1 criteria at 6 weeks. A conditional inference tree was used to determine an optimal HU cutoff for predicting outcome. Bonferroni-adjusted multivariate logistic regression was conducted to investigate the independent associations between imaging features and response after controlling for demographics, doses of IL-2, and RCC prognostic scales (eg, Heng and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center \[MSKCC\]).

## Results

Most subjects had intermediate prognosis by Heng (65% \[49 of 75\]) and the MSKCC (63% \[47 of 75\]) criteria; 7% had complete response and 12% had partial response. Mean attenuation of low-density dorsal muscles was a significant univariate predictor of IL-2 response after Bonferroni correction ( _P_ = 0.03). The odds of responding to treatment were 5.8 times higher for subjects with higher-attenuation low-density dorsal muscles (optimal cutoff: 18.1 HU). This persisted in multivariate analysis ( _P_ = 0.02). Body mass index ( _P_ = 0.67) and the Heng ( _P_ = 0.22) and MSKCC ( _P_ = 0.08) clinical prognostic scales were not significant predictors of response.

## Conclusions

Mean cross-sectional attenuation of low-density dorsal muscles (ie, sarcopenia) may predict IL-2 response in metastatic RCC. Clinical variables are poor predictors of response.

## Introduction

Sarcopenia is a recently explored body type that is diagnosable by data routinely acquired with computed tomography (CT) and is associated with a range of negative outcomes including the following: postoperative infectious and noninfectious complications , mortality following liver transplantation , adrenocortical carcinoma mortality , and truncated disease-free survival in stage III melanoma managed with systemic interleukin-2 (IL-2) , among others . In short, sarcopenia is the combination of low core muscle volume and density—characterized by diminutive psoas and dorsal muscles—and high core muscle adiposity. Sarcopenia has been shown repeatedly to outperform common clinical markers of general health such as age and body mass index in predicting patient outcomes .

Sarcopenia has been shown to be prognostic in stage III melanoma and predictive of response to ipilimumab in stage IV melanoma . We were interested to know whether the sarcopenia body type also could be used to predict outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treated with IL-2, as both melanoma and RCC are responsive to immunotherapies . A small subset (7%–8%) of patients with metastatic RCC treated with IL-2 experience a complete response to therapy that tends to be durable , with some patients alive and without disease for more than 10 years. However, the majority of patients do not respond at all, and reliable pretreatment prediction of which patients are most likely to benefit using clinical criteria has been elusive. Because of the high cost, potential toxicity, and low response rate (~20%) associated with IL-2 therapy, sparing patients from therapy who are least likely to benefit is desirable .
