## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the acquisition and interpretation times of screen-film mammography and soft-copy digital mammography in a diagnostic mammography center.

## Materials and Methods

The study was conducted in three phases for patients presenting for clinical diagnostic workup to a mammography clinic. In the first phase, technologist acquisition and processing times and radiologist interpretation time were measured for patients imaged with a screen-film mammographic system. During the second phase of the study, times were measured for patients imaged with a direct radiographic digital mammographic system, with interpretation performed on a soft-copy display system. During the third phase, 3 months after installation of the soft-copy display system, times were measured again for patients imaged on the same direct radiographic digital mammographic system, with interpretation with the same soft-copy system. The same four experienced breast imaging radiologists and seven technologists participated in all phases of the study. All data were entered into a database, and statistical analysis was conducted using weighted linear models and logarithmic transformation.

## Results

Times were obtained for 295 patients. There were 100 patients each for phases 1 and 2 and 95 patients for phase 3. Diagnostic mammographic acquisition times with processing were 13.02 min/case for screen film (phase 1), 8.16 min/case for digital (phase 2), and 10.66 min/case for digital (phase 3) ( _P_ < .001 and _P_ < .0001, respectively). In addition, the radiologist interpretation time for digital mammography in both phases was not significantly different from that for film mammography ( _P_ = .2853 and _P_ = .2893, respectively). There was no significant difference between phases 2 and 3 ( _P_ = 1.0000). The mean interpretation times were 3.75 min/case for screen film, 2.14 min/case for digital (phase 2), and 2.26 min/case for digital (phase 3).

## Conclusions

Digital mammography significantly shortened the acquisition time for diagnostic mammography. There was no significant difference in interpretation time compared to screen-film mammography in a diagnostic mammography setting.

Full-field digital mammography (FFDM) continues to increase in clinical use in the United States since its US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2000. As of December 2009, approximately 53% of US mammography facilities had one or more full-field digital mammographic units . This is a significant increase from 2005, when approximately 7% of US facilities used digital units .

For mammography centers that are currently considering whether to convert to FFDM, the initial impact on work flow continues to be a concern. FFDM offers the advantages of decoupling image acquisition, display, and storage , in addition to the elimination of wet chemical processing over screen-film mammography (SFM). The latter was the primary reason that led to a decrease in the acquisition time of FFDM compared to SFM in a screening mammography setting, as reported by Berns et al . However, they also reported an increase in interpretation time with FFDM .
