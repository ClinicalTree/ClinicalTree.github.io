## Rationale and Objective

To develop and evaluate a method for predicting and reducing motion artifacts in free-breathing liver perfusion computed tomography (CT) scanning with couch shuttling and to compare tumor and liver parenchyma perfusion values.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty patients (23 males, 7 females, median age of 74 years) with primary or metastatic intrahepatic tumors underwent dynamic contrast enhanced CT scans with axial shuttling. A semiautomatic respiratory motion correction algorithm was applied to align the acquired images along the z-axis. Perfusion maps were generated using the dual-input Johnson-Wilson model. Root mean squared deviation (RMSD) maps of the model fit to the pixel time-density curves were calculated.

## Results

Precorrection RMSD correlated positively with magnitude of change in functional values resulting from motion. Blood flow, arterial blood flow, and permeability surface product were significantly increased in tumor compared to normal tissue ( _P_ < .05), blood volume was significantly reduced in tumor compared to normal tissue ( _P_ < .05). In a subgroup of patients with high-amplitude motion significant difference was observed between uncorrected and motion correction blood flow maps.

## Conclusions

Patients can breathe freely during hepatic perfusion imaging if retrospective motion correction is applied to reduce motion artifacts. RMSD provides a regional assessment of motion induced artifacts in liver perfusion maps.

- ## Key points:

- 1.
Allowing patients to breathe freely during liver DCE-CT acquisition is possible if images are corrected for motion before functional maps are generated.

![Figure 1, Motion correction algorithm flowchart. After the best matching slice has been determined, new slices are interpolated at 1.25 mm spacing between the best slice and adjacent slices and cross correlated with the reference image. Image shift is the difference in slice location between reference slice and best matching slice. After shifting images, some slices may be missing at superior or inferior edge; these slices are regenerated by temporal interpolation between slices at same location in previous and later time steps.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/PredictionandReductionofMotionArtifactsinFreeBreathingDynamicContrastEnhancedCTPerfusionImagingofPrimaryandMetastaticIntrahepaticTumors/0_1s20S1076633212005375.jpg)

Note the more uniform blood flow and hepatic arterial fraction values throughout the liver in the respiratory motion correction maps versus those in the motion uncorrected maps and the reduction in root mean square deviation values at organ edge. (i–l) Motion uncorrected functional maps of patient 12. The similarity of the root mean square deviation maps (f) and (j) suggests that CT perfusion scan of patient 12 had less respiratory liver motion than patient 24 and that the developed image registration algorithm was able to reduce the respiratory motion in patient 24 to the same level as that in patient 12. The high blood flow and hepatic arterial fraction in the anterior part of the liver of patient 12 is the tumor, which appears as being marginally hypodense in the averaged CT image (i) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/PredictionandReductionofMotionArtifactsinFreeBreathingDynamicContrastEnhancedCTPerfusionImagingofPrimaryandMetastaticIntrahepaticTumors/5_1s20S1076633212005375.jpg)
