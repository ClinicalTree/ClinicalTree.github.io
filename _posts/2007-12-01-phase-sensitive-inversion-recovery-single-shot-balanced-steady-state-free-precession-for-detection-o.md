## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to show that phase-sensitive detection and a single-shot technique allow imaging of the heart for detection of myocardial infarction during a single breathhold without adaptation of the inversion time.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-five patients at 2 weeks to 3 months after Q-wave myocardial infarction were examined on a 1.5-T MR system 10 minutes after the administration of a double-dose extravascular contrast agent. In order to determine the optimal inversion recovery time (TI), a TI scout sequence was performed. An IR-turboFlash sequence with optimized TI was used as standard of reference. A phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) single-shot TrueFISP sequence, which allows imaging of nine slices during one breathhold (TR/TE/FA/BW: 2.2 ms/1.1 ms/60°, 8°/1220 Hz/Px) was used with a nominal TI of 200 ms. Spatial resolution was identical for both techniques: 1.3 mm × 1.8 mm × 8 mm. Infarct volumes, area of infarction on a selected slice, and scan time for imaging delayed contrast enhancement (DCE) were compared.

## Results

The mean values for the time of imaging DCE were 10 minutes 43 seconds for the IR turboFLASH and 17 seconds ( _P_ < .001) for the PSIR single-shot TrueFISP sequence. No significant difference was found for the mean values of the infarct volumes with 18.7 ml (IR turboFLASH) and 17.3 ml (PSIR single-shot TrueFISP). The values for the correlation coefficients of the infarct volumes and infarct areas of the two different techniques were _r_ = 0.95 ( _P_ < .004) and _r_ = 0.97 ( _P_ < .002). The regression equations were _y_ = 0.76 + 0.92\* _x_ and _y_ = 0.07 + 0.93\* _x_ , respectively.

## Conclusions

PSIR single-shot TrueFISP allows for accurate identification of myocardial infarction during a single breathhold with reduction of scan time by a factor of 38.

Imaging myocardial infarction by MRI using the effect of delayed hyperenhancement is an established and accurate method (1−5). In patients with coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between viable and nonviable myocardium by contrast-enhanced MRI allows the prediction of functional recovery after surgical or interventional revascularization ( ). In contrast to positron-emission tomography and single-photon-emission computed tomography ( ), delayed contrast-enhanced MRI has superior spatial resolution and can differentiate transmural from nontransmural myocardial infarction. The area of hyperenhancement shows a close correlation with histopathologically determined area of myocardial infarction (MI) in animal experiments ( ).

The most widely used pulse sequence type to depict late enhancing areas in the myocardium is inversion-recovery (IR) turboFLASH with magnitude reconstruction. This pulse sequence requires an individual adaptation of the inversion-recovery time (TI) to achieve optimal signal increase between infarcted and viable myocardium. At the optimal TI, the signal intensity of normal myocardium is nulled. Several breathholds can be necessary to determine the optimal TI value. An error in selection of the optimum null time leads to a reduction in contrast and may reduce the visible hyperenhanced area and therefore may cause an underestimation of the extent of the infarction ( ).
