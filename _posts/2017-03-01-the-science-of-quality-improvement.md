Scientific rigor should be consistently applied to quality improvement (QI) research to ensure that healthcare interventions improve quality and patient safety before widespread implementation. This article provides an overview of the various study designs that can be used for QI research depending on the stage of investigation, scope of the QI intervention, constraints on the researchers and intervention being studied, and evidence needed to support widespread implementation. The most commonly used designs in QI studies are quasi-experimental designs. Randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized trials are typically reserved for large-scale research projects evaluating the effectiveness of QI interventions that may be implemented broadly, have more than a minimal impact on patients, or are costly. Systematic reviews of QI studies will play an important role in providing overviews of evidence supporting particular QI interventions or methods of achieving change. We also review the general requirements for developing quality measures for reimbursement, public reporting, and pay-for-performance initiatives. A critical part of the testing process for quality measures includes assessment of feasibility, reliability, validity, and unintended consequences. Finally, publication and critical appraisal of QI work is discussed as an essential component to generating evidence supporting QI initiatives in radiology.

## Introduction

Fundamental differences between quality improvement (QI) research and traditional scientific research can be best understood by articulating the goals of these two distinct activities. QI research is designed to achieve positive change in a specific process or service that tends to be highly dependent on the local environment. These projects usually focus on a well-defined problem, build in feedback on immediate outcomes to allow for the adjustment of interventions, and are generally not dependent on a deep understanding of the mechanisms of change involved in the interventions . Traditional scientific research is designed to explicitly test a hypothesis, eliminate or minimize bias, and yield new generalizable knowledge with a focus on the mechanisms of cause and effect. Some features of QI and traditional research overlap. Hypothesis-driven testing constitutes a critical part of QI, although QI includes other systematic activities distinct from scientific research such as goal-setting, performance measurement and feedback, standardization, and education . Scientific rigor should be consistently applied to QI research to ensure that patients do not suffer harm in the name of QI.

Considerable debate exists regarding the use of health-care interventions designed to improve quality and patient safety without clear evidence that benefits outweigh costs and harms. Proponents of implementing large-scale health-care interventions without compelling evidence note that in many instances, it may be costly, difficult, or impossible to generate evidence. This difficulty may relate to problems blinding investigators or participants, inability to establish causality, or issues related to interventions that are highly dependent on local context and culture . Opponents argue that if the evidence is not compelling, well-intentioned interventions may fail to improve health or may even cause harm, while costing dearly . One example of a QI initiative in radiology that has been successfully implemented in many different local environments is the Image Gently campaign, which also serves as one of the National Quality Forum's (NQF) Safe Practice guidelines to reduce unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation for children .

The goals of this review are to (1) provide a review of QI research methodologies and study designs that can generate high-quality evidence regarding QI interventions in radiology, (2) review the ethics of QI research, (3) discuss the rationale and process for developing quality measures, and (4) provide guidance on the preparation and review of manuscripts regarding QI initiatives. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance convened a task force to explore this topic with the results presented in this review.

## Quality Improvement Study Designs

Many QI study designs draw from health services research, social science, and other disciplines, each with advantages and disadvantages in dealing with the complexities of clinical practice . These designs attempt to establish a causal relationship between an intervention and a change in outcome. The choice of design depends on both the purpose of the study and the degree of control the investigators have over delivery of the intervention . Campbell et al suggest that the evaluation of complex interventions should follow a sequential approach that provides increasing evidence :

This histogram shows that a small percentage of patients are performed on time ( light gray bars ) with a relatively broad distribution, indicating variation in the process. The goals of this quality improvement project were to (1) increase the percentage of examinations performed on time and (2) to reduce variation in the process leading to the cases illustrated on the far left of the histogram.

These data were used to identify defects that contribute most to delays to prioritize interventions mitigating these defects. For example, protocoling for computed tomography examinations was transitioned from a paper-based system to an electronic system to reduce delays related to protocols not being completed in advance of the appointment time.
