Before I began reading breast magnetic resonance images several years ago, I digested as much written material, most of it excellent in scope and quality, as I could. However, it was not until I got in the tall grass with actual cases that I began to really figure it out.

Raza et al have published a beautiful volume that affords exposure to a large amount of vital information, presented in a logical and appealing manner, which helps students of breast magnetic resonance imaging skip the tall grass phase on the learning curve.

The book is divided into four parts. Part 1 provides an introduction, discussing indications, technical considerations (including a very helpful pictorial treatment of artifacts), an overview of the magnetic resonance imaging Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon, and kinetics. Part 2 discusses findings, organized around strict Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System terminology and illustrated extensively. Part 3 handles “other findings,” such as posttreatment and classically benign findings, as well as associated features of malignancy. Part 4 considers special topics, such as imaging of implants.

The text is written in bullet-point style but reads smoothly and contains a huge amount of useful material. The main selling point of the book, however, is the abundance of high-quality images, well organized and captioned in great detail. If one were to digest all the cases and examples provided in association with accompanying the text, one would be well down the path of virtual experience in magnetic resonance interpretation. As with other Amirsys volumes, there is an electronic version of the book included, allowing it to be easily stored and accessed at the workstation.

I strongly recommend this volume to anyone who interprets breast magnetic resonance images, especially as a way of reinforcing and consolidating knowledge gained via traditional prose textbooks and review articles.
