## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to review the role of a quality information program (QUIP) as a semiautomated educational feedback mechanism and to review common errors in cross-sectional abdominal and pelvic studies as an initiative for continuing medical education and improving patient care.

## Materials and Methods

Abdominal and pelvic errors identified by QUIP and cases collected from morbidity and mortality conferences were reviewed. Errors were classified and graded to levels of morbidity.

## Results

There were 222 errors in 218 patients over 4 years in this study. One hundred thirteen (51%) were identified after the introduction of QUIP (January to December 2009). One hundred thirty-eight studies (61%) were read independently, while 84 (39%) were double-read. Sixty-five percent of errors (145 of 222) were false-negatives, of which 45 (31%) were “satisfaction-of-search” errors. There were 62 cognitive errors (28%), nine technical errors (4%), eight communication errors (4%), six ordering errors (3%), and five false-positives identified. Seventy-six percent of errors were identified on computed tomography ( _n_ = 168); fewer cases involved ultrasound ( _n_ = 20 \[9%\]) and magnetic resonance ( _n_ = 34 \[15%\]). Forty-one percent resulted in no changes to patient outcomes. Forty-percent caused minor patient morbidity, and 19% caused major patient morbidity, including three cases (1%) that likely contributed to patient death.

## Conclusions

Most abdominopelvic errors in this study were classified as false-negatives. Many can be attributed to satisfaction-of-search errors. Implementing a simple, semiautomated QUIP allows timely feedback regarding errors to radiologists. This may improve the quality of health care while allowing radiologists the opportunity to learn from each case they are involved in.

With the increasing use of diagnostic imaging for patient diagnosis, management, and follow-up, the role and scope of radiologists in image synthesis are expanding. Identifying relevant findings pertaining to patient symptoms as well as reporting significant incidental or unexpected findings are among the key responsibilities of our specialty.

At our teaching institution, we have developed a quality initiative program (QUIP), which is a confidential, semiautomated method of documenting and following up on subsequently identified errors. QUIP includes an e-mail template accessible from a desktop Outlook (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) public e-mail folder or anonymously through the agency of a transcriptionist (  Fig 1 ). The Outlook folder is part of a virtual PC that is accessible on the third screen of our picture archiving and communication system (McKesson Corporation, San Francisco, CA) but is a separate system. This shortcut to the virtual machine servers opens up a virtual session as if on a regular PC. It does not use any of the picture archiving and communication system's computing resources. The Outlook e-mail template is preaddressed to appropriate recipients, including the section chief (eg, of abdominopelvic radiology) and the administrative assistant. It has fields that can be quickly filled in with case identifiers, the date of the study in question, and a brief account of the event requiring attention (such as inappropriate protocolling, interpretation issues, or transcription errors). Finally, the specific QUIP case is also addressed to the radiologist (or radiologists) who created the original report and would therefore most benefit from this information (  Fig 1 ). It is sent in the form of an email with the title “QUIP” to allow easy identification. The recipient radiologist is required to reply to the section chief by checking off one of the four options at the bottom of the standardized QUIP form. Action options include (1) reviewing the case, (2) making an addendum to the original report, (3) contacting the referring clinician (if the finding is of sufficient clinical importance) or (4) other, in rare cases where there may be extenuating circumstances involved.

A subtle neuroendocrine neoplasm was not identified ( arrows ). (b) Follow-up fat-saturated T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 2 months later demonstrated a low–signal intensity area in the head of the pancreas ( arrows ). This was considered a false-negative finding. This error was classified as causing minor morbidity, because the diagnosis was delayed but there was no significant change in the size of the lesion in the interval and no development of metastases. The patient went on to have surgical resection and did well clinically.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/IntroductionofQUIPQualityInformationProgramasaSemiautomatedQualityAssessmentEndeavorAllowingRetrospectiveReviewofErrorsinCrosssectionalAbdominalImaging/0_1s20S1076633211003394.jpg)

The report indicated the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus ( black arrow ), in addition to the known liver metastasis ( white arrow ). This was an early portal-venous phase, and this finding was due to admixing of unopacified blood from the lower extremities with venous blood from the kidneys that already had intravenous contrast in it. This is an example of a false-positive error. Although the patient may have had anxiety related to the original report, follow-up Doppler ultrasound 4 days later (b) confirmed patency of the IVC ( white arrow ). This error was therefore felt to be of no clinical consequence.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/IntroductionofQUIPQualityInformationProgramasaSemiautomatedQualityAssessmentEndeavorAllowingRetrospectiveReviewofErrorsinCrosssectionalAbdominalImaging/1_1s20S1076633211003394.jpg)

The sum of the errors by type exceeds the number of error cases identified, because several cases involved more than one type of error.

The report did describe the primary cervical cancer with local staging, as well as other incidental findings in the kidneys, but these lymph nodes were reported ( arrow ). This was classified as a satisfaction-of-search error (a type of false-negative error) because only a few sequences of the upper abdomen were included in the field of view on this magnetic resonance imaging study, and most images were focused in the pelvis for local staging. The subsequent unenhanced axial computed tomographic scan performed 1 week later (b) as part of the overall staging shows the para-aortic lymphadenopathy ( arrow ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/IntroductionofQUIPQualityInformationProgramasaSemiautomatedQualityAssessmentEndeavorAllowingRetrospectiveReviewofErrorsinCrosssectionalAbdominalImaging/2_1s20S1076633211003394.jpg)
