## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to evaluate integrated adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D (AIDR 3D) algorithm in automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) for the quantification of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and cardiac risk stratification.

## Materials and Methods

A thoracic phantom with calcium inserts of known densities was scanned with filtered back projection (FBP) and AIDR 3D algorithms in small- and medium-sized phantoms. Twenty-four patients underwent two consecutive scans of CACS with FBP and AIDR 3D algorithms. The absolute Agatston score, Agatston score risk, volume score, and Agatston score percentile-based risk were compared, and concordance coefficients and agreement plots were made.

## Results

Agatston and volume scores were significantly different between the phantom sizes ( _P_ < .01). There were no significant differences in the Agatston scores between FBP and AIDR 3D for the medium phantoms ( _P_ = .25). In the patients, there were no significant differences in Agatston and volume scores between FBP and AIDR 3D ( _P_ = .06 and _P_ = .09, respectively). The correlation coefficients of Agatston and volume scores with AIDR 3D were excellent compared to those of FBP. There were no significant differences in Agatston score risk and Agatston score percentile-based risk between FBP and AIDR 3D ( _P_ = .74 and _P_ = 1, respectively). There was mean dose reduction of 57.8% ± 18.6% for AIDR 3D.

## Conclusion

The absolute Agatston score differed between FBP and AIDR 3D reconstructions. However, the cardiac risk categorizations of the two methods were comparable. An integrated AIDR 3D algorithm with automatic tube current modulation enables radiation dose savings at a consistent noise level without sacrificing CACS.

## Introduction

To date, coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide . An early and accurate diagnosis of CAD should prompt aggressive treatment and lead to the prevention of heart attacks and unfavorable outcomes . Because the extent of coronary artery calcium (CAC), which is a pathognomonic hallmark of CAD, is strongly correlated with the degree of atherosclerosis, CAC scanning has emerged to assess the risk for CAD by using the CAC score (CACS) . CAC scanning serves as a noninvasive and convenient diagnostic tool and provides excellent diagnostic value for detecting calcified plaque in patients with CAD, particularly in the intermediate-risk cohort . However, CAC scanning can be associated with higher radiation exposure using the filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction method, which can result in an effective dose range of 1.2–2.0 mSv . Based on the principle of “as low as reasonably achievable,” radiation exposure should be kept at an acceptable minimum through the optimization of the CAC scanning without losing imaging quality.

Currently, several approaches to reduce radiation exposure have been developed, including the tube current and voltage reduction, the prospective scanning with electrocardiogram modulation, and new reconstruction methods . However, tube current and voltage reductions will lead to increased image noise, which is a reliable index for image quality. Because it is image quality that constrains the dose, maintaining a reasonable image noise level for CAC scanning across different patient sizes is important. The consensus report by McCollough et al. established an image noise target on the basis of three different patient sizes that are categorized by the lateral chest width on computed tomography (CT) .
