## Rationale and Objectives

The optimal phase for the measurement of the aortic annular area for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not standardized, although most agree that systolic measurements are preferred, when the annulus is larger. We hypothesized that the maximum annular area occurs at the cardiac phase of the maximum aortic valve opening (MAVO) and that this phase can be accurately and reproducibly assessed by visual inspection only.

## Materials and Methods

The aortic valve opening area was inspected visually by two readers to determine the MAVO phase. The annular area was measured at the MAVO phase and the typical systolic phase (35% of the R-R interval). Differences in the annular area that would change valve sizing for prostheses were noted.

## Results

Fifty patients (mean age 81) were studied. Ninety percent had the MAVO at the 15%–25% R-R interval. There was high interobserver correlation (0.89) for determining the MAVO phase by visual inspection. For 49 out of 50 patients, the annular area was maximal at the MAVO phase. The mean difference in the annular area between the MAVO phase and 35% was 22.3 (±4.57) mm  2 . In 12% of the patients, the difference in the annular area changed the recommended size of a self-expanding prosthesis and would have altered the procedure in 32% for balloon-expandable prostheses.

## Conclusions

Visually assessed MAVO occurs in early systole for most patients and is almost always the cardiac phase of the maximal aortic annular area. This method allows rapid and reproducible determination of the appropriate phase for TAVR planning measurements. Consideration should be given to optimizing pre-TAVR computed tomography acquisitions for early systolic reconstruction and visual determination of the MAVO.

## Introduction

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement in selected patients, including patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis who are not considered to be suitable candidates for surgery . Because the size of the annulus varies with the phase of the cardiac cycle , accurate assessment of the aortic annulus is a critical step in the planning of TAVR for sizing and determining patient eligibility because it enables proper valve sizing, grading calcification of the aortic annulus, and measurement of the distance to the coronaries' origin. Concerning computed tomography (CT) protocols for annular assessment in TAVR patients, guidelines issued by the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography in 2012 provide useful recommendations for data acquisition in this setting . The guidelines describe that the aortic root acquisition is performed during suspended respiration with either a “prospective” or a “retrospective ECG-gating with tube current modulation,” and a reconstructed slice thickness of less than 1 mm. However, specific protocols will vary depending on the institution and available scanner platform. Importantly, if multiphase data are available, systolic images are utilized for annular measurements as prior studies have demonstrated larger annular dimensions during systole. The change in annular dimensions during the cardiac cycle appears predominantly to affect annular area and short axis diameter measurements as annular configuration becomes less eccentric during systole. The annulus size increases in systole by 6%–13% with calcified valves, which applies in most TAVR cases . Therefore, even though the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography guidelines do not mandate multiphase reconstructions for a pre-TAVR computed tomography angiogram (CTA) , most institutions do obtain these data by performing a retrospectively gated CTA.

At which specific systolic phase is the annulus maximal in size? Possibilities include end systole when the left ventricular (LV) volume is minimal or when the aortic valve opening is maximal. Although the consensus is to use a systolic phase because the annulus is larger, the specific phase of the cardiac cycle for optimal measurement of the annular area is not standardized , and there is no guideline to determine the best phase for annular measurement to avoid postprocedural paravalvular regurgitation or aortic annulus injury. Specifically, there is no consensus on the optimal systolic phase for TAVR planning. One approach is a fixed percentage of the R-R interval, for example, 30%–35% for systole and 65%–70% for diastole , with one study showing that the physiological systolic phase was more likely 40%–50% of the R-R interval, at which point the LV volume is minimal . There is a need to standardize the measurement protocol for TAVR, and an optimal method for measurement should be chosen that is universally used to size prosthetic valves for TAVR. In our practice, we noticed that the phase of the maximum aortic valve opening (MAVO) was not always identical to the phase of the minimal LV volume in patients with stenotic valves and was seen earlier than both 30%–35% and 40%–50% of the cardiac cycle.
