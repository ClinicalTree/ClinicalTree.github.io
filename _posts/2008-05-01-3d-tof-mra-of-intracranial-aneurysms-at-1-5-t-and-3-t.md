## Rationale and Objectives

A 3-T magnetic resonance imaging system provides a better signal-to-noise ratio and inflow effect than 1.5 T in three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of matrix, parallel imaging, and acquisition time on image quality of 3D TOF MRA at 1.5 and 3 T, and to illustrate whether the combination of larger matrixes with parallel imaging technique is feasible, by evaluating the visualization of simulated intracranial aneurysms and aneurysmal blebs using a vascular phantom with pulsatile flow.

## Materials and Methods

An anthropomorphic vascular phantom was designed to simulate the various intracranial aneurysms with aneurysmal bleb. The vascular phantom was connected to an electromagnetic flow pump with pulsatile flow, and we obtained 1.5- and 3-T MRAs altering the parameters of 3D TOF sequences, including acquisition time. Two radiologists evaluated the depiction of simulated aneurysms and aneurysmal blebs.

## Results

The aneurysmal blebs were not sufficiently visualized on the high-spatial resolution 1.5-T MRA (matrix size of 384 × 256 or 512 × 256), even with longer acquisition time (9 or 18 min). At 3 T with acquisition time of 4.5 min using parallel imaging technique, however, the depiction of aneurysmal blebs was significantly better for the high-spatial resolution sequence than for the standard resolution sequence. For the high-spatial resolution sequence, the longer acquisition times did not improve the depiction of aneurysmal blebs in comparison with 4.5 min at 3 T.

## Conclusions

For 3D TOF MRA, the combination of the large matrix with parallel imaging technique is feasible at 3 T, but not at 1.5 T.

Three-dimensional time-of-flight (3D TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a noninvasive imaging modality now readily accepted as a first-line diagnostic tool in magnetic resonance examination of several cerebrovascular diseases ( ). Concerning TOF MRA, the 3-T system offers some potential advantages compared to the 1.5-T system. The approximate doubling of signal-to-noise ratio from 1.5 to 3 T can provide the higher spatial resolution ( ) and the increased T1 relaxation time at higher magnetic field strength yields improvement of vessel–tissue contrast at 3-T imaging ( ). Several previous studies have reported that the high-spatial resolution 3-T MRA allows better visualization of small vessel segments and vascular disease, including intracranial aneurysms and intracranial stenoses and obstructions ( ). The various parameters of the 3D TOF MR angiograms, such as the matrix size, reduction factor in parallel imaging, and acquisition time, however, have not been compared between 1.5 and 3 T.

The purpose of this study is to analyze the influence of matrix, parallel imaging, and acquisition time on image quality of 3D TOF MRA at 1.5 and 3 T, and to illustrate whether the combination of larger matrixes with the parallel imaging technique is feasible, by evaluating the visualization of simulated intracranial aneurysms and aneurysmal blebs using a vascular phantom with pulsatile flow.
