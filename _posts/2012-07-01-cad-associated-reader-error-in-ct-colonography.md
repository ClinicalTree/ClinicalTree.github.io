## Rationale and Objectives

Computed tomographic colonographic interpretation with computer-aided detection (CAD) may be superior to unaided viewing, although polyp characteristics may influence accuracy. Reader error due to polyp characteristics was evaluated in a multiple-case, multiple-reader trial of computed tomographic colonography with CAD.

## Materials and Methods

Two experts retrospectively reviewed 52 positive cases (74 polyps) and categorized them as hard, moderate, or easy to detect. Each case was evaluated without and with CAD. Features that may influence a reader's ability to detect a polyp or to accept or reject a CAD mark were tabulated. The association between polyp characteristics and detection rates in the trial was assessed. The difference in detection rates (CAD vs unassisted) was calculated, and regression analysis was performed.

## Results

Of 64 polyps found by CAD, experts categorized 20 as hard, 28 as moderate, and 16 as easy to detect. Reader characterization errors predominated (47.3%) over other errors. Factors associated with lower detection rates included small size, flat morphology, and resemblance to a thickened fold. CAD was superior for polyps resembling lipomas compared to those that did not resemble lipomas (average increase in detection rate with CAD, 12.8% vs 5.5%; _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Polyp characteristic may impair computed tomographic colonographic interpretation augmented by CAD. Readers can avoid errors of measurement by evaluating diminutive polyp candidates with sample measurements. Caution should be taken when evaluating focally thick folds and when using visual impression to dismiss a polyp candidate as a lipoma when it is submerged in densely tagged fluid.

Computed tomographic (CT) colonography (or “virtual colonoscopy”) is an examination of the colon to detect polyps and masses that is endorsed by the American Cancer Society for colorectal cancer screening. Substantial training is required to learn how to interpret CT colonographic studies , and despite the reported high sensitivity for polyps ≥6 mm in size in some large screening trials , sensitivity has been lower in other trials . This variability has been attributed to many factors, but the largest factor seems to be observer errors due to missing polyps that could potentially have been recognized . However, certain errors, such as those due to immobile stool that is untagged by oral contrast, are unavoidable. Other sources of error in reading CT colonographic studies involve technique-related or patient-related factors (eg, collapsed bowel, polyps obscured by untagged residual fluid, poor scanning technique, respiratory motion). Small lesions and plaquelike flat lesions are also potential sources of error .

Computer-aided detection (CAD) has been developed and tested as a means to improve reader sensitivity. CAD systems detect raised areas suspicious for polyps and then use a set of classifiers to reduce false-positives (eg, analyzing the texture of a polyp candidate to determine if it is stool) . CAD has high sensitivity in stand-alone trials (ie, comparing optical colonoscopic truth to CAD software output without a human reader) . When CAD is used by a human reader, the reader may accept or reject a CAD hit, so the ultimate benefit of CAD depends on whether it helps or hinders the radiologist interpreting an exam . For example, polyps with irregular surface shapes have been shown to be more likely to be dismissed as not polyps even when detected by CAD . Consequently, CAD observer trials are important in proving the benefit of CAD-assisted reading .

This lesion was categorized as having surface tagging in retrospective review, ordinarily a helpful sign in detecting polyps. Note that because of a partial volume effect, some of the high density appears to be within the polyp, rather than just on the surface.
