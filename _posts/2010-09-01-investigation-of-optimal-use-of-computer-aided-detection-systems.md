## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to explore different computerized models (the “machine”) as a means to achieve optimal use of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems and to investigate whether these models can play a primary role in clinical decision making and possibly replace a clinician's subjective decision for combining his or her own assessment with that provided by a CAD system.

## Materials and Methods

Data previously collected from a fully crossed, multiple-reader, multiple-case observer study with and without CAD by seven observers asked to identify simulated small masses on two separate sets of 100 mammographic images (low-contrast and high-contrast sets; ie, low-contrast and high-contrast simulated masses added to random locations on normal mammograms) were used. This allowed testing two relative sensitivities between the observers and CAD. Seven models that combined detection assessments from CAD standalone, unaided read, and CAD-aided read (second read and concurrent read) were developed using the leave-one-out technique for training and testing. These models were personalized for each observer. Detection performance accuracies were analyzed using the area under a portion of the free-response receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUFC), sensitivity, and number of false-positives per image.

## Results

For the low-contrast set, the use of computerized models resulted in significantly higher AUFCs compared to the unaided read mode for all readers, whereas the increased AUFCs between CAD-aided (second and concurrent reads; ie, decisions made by the readers) and unaided read modes were statistically significant for a majority, but not all, of the readers (four and five of the seven readers, respectively). For the high-contrast set, there were no significant trends in the AUFCs whether or not a model was used to combine the original reading modes. Similar results were observed when using sensitivity as the figure of merit. However, the average number of false-positives per image resulting from the computerized models remained the same as that obtained from the unaided read modes.

## Conclusions

Individual computerized models (the machine) that combine image assessments from CAD standalone, unaided read, and CAD-aided read can increase detection performance compared to the reading done by the observer. However, relative sensitivity (ie, the difference in sensitivity between CAD standalone and unaided read) was a critical factor that determined incremental improvement in decision making, whether made by the observer or using computerized models.

Over the past two decades, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have become more pervasive in clinical practice to assist radiologists in their decision making . These systems are intended to help reduce radiologist errors of detection in the identification of early-stage disease and in particular to improve the detection of early-stage cancer. Early-stage cancer typically produces no symptoms but may be revealed through imaging examination. Finding early-stage cancer in patient images or image data is a challenging task and, for radiologists, is akin to looking for a “needle in a haystack.” These challenges in detection are due to the often subtle distinction between early disease and normal tissue, the low disease prevalence in the population, or a combination thereof. Identification (or detection) and interpretation (or diagnosis) of imaging findings indicative of cancer depends on various factors, from technical to psychoperceptual . The human task of image interpretation is a major source of variability in disease detection compared to the technical aspect of imaging patients .

CAD was developed for the detection of a variety of cancers, including breast and lung cancer as well as colonic polyps. CAD devices generally perform automatic assessments of patients' images or image data (eg, mammograms, computed tomographic scans, magnetic resonance imaging data) and present to radiologists areas that the CAD systems have determined as having the appearance of an abnormality (ie, an image finding). However, CAD system performance is variable and depends on the organ, disease, type of imaging finding, and so on. In mammography, although CAD excels at identifying microcalcifications, it is less effective at identifying masses . In general (ie, independent of the organ of interest), CAD systems also tend to err on the side of caution, presenting images with a large number of false-positive (FP) marks . Some marks are easily dismissed by a radiologist or physician interpreter, but other marks may result in clinical actions being taken (eg, an FP CAD mark on a mammogram may lead to an unnecessary additional imaging examination and/or biopsy). Even with these caveats, CAD systems are commonly used as an additional (or a companion) “pair of eyes” to a radiologist, who is otherwise alone in the interpretation of patient images or image data, unless double reading is performed by a colleague or associate. The value of CAD in actual clinical practice remains ambiguous. The published literature reveals many controversies in the field of CAD , and many authors recognize the need for additional clinical investigations to provide more definitive evidence of the effect of CAD systems on patient care and clinical outcomes.
