## Rationale and Objectives

To compare B-mode ultrasonography (US) alone with the combination of B-mode and contrast-enhanced (Sonazoid) late-phase pulse-inversion US for the detection of hepatic metastases by use of jackknife free-response receiver-operating characteristic (JAFROC) analysis.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-seven patients with 57 hepatic metastases and 6 patients without hepatic metastases underwent B-mode and contrast-enhanced US. We used the diagnoses established by contrast-enhanced computed tomography and contrast-enhanced US as the standard of reference. All ultrasonographic scanning was performed by an experienced radiologist with a routine clinical procedure. All scanning data were archived with digital cine clips. A review system, which can display pairs of cine clips for B-mode and contrast-enhanced US side by side, was developed for off-site observer study. Seven radiologists interpreted each case individually first by B-mode US only, and then by the combination with contrast-enhanced US by identifying locations of possible candidates for hepatic metastasis with their confidence ratings. The figure-of-merit (FOM) values, sensitivity, and false-positives per case were estimated for B-mode US alone, and for the combination of B-mode and contrast-enhanced US.

## Results

The sensitivities of the combined ultrasonographic imaging (mean, 72.2%) were clearly improved from that of B-mode US alone (mean, 41.6%) while reducing the average number of false positives from 1.1 to 0.5 per case. In the jackknife analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between mean FOM values for the combined imaging (0.76) and for B-mode US alone (0.44, _P_ < .00001).

## Conclusion

Evaluating cine clips of contrast-enhanced liver US together with B-mode US could improve physicians' accuracy for detection of hepatic metastases.

The liver is one of the most common sites for metastases, and the detection of metastases is crucially important because of therapeutic and prognostic implications. Accurate staging is a prerequisite for successful surgery and for monitoring of chemotherapy. Because the sensitivity of conventional ultrasonography (US) for hepatic metastases was relatively poor (53%–77%) , contrast material-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have been recommended for the detection of liver metastases.

It has been reported that the advent of the microbubble contrast agent SHU 508A (Levovist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) and the development of a gray-scale microbubble-specific ultrasonographic technique, which was called pulse- or phase-inversion harmonic contrast enhanced US, has remarkably improved the detection of liver metastases by use of US . However, contrast-enhanced US with SHU 508A is limited because prolonged evaluation of liver contrast enhancement cannot be performed due to a technical factor .
