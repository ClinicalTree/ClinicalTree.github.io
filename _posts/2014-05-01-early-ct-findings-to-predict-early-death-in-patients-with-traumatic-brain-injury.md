## Rationale and Objectives

Computed tomography (CT) plays a crucial role in early assessment of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Marshall and Rotterdam are the mostly used scoring systems, in which CT findings are grouped differently. We sought to determine the scoring system and initial CT findings predicting the death at hospital discharge (early death) in patients with TBI.

## Materials and Methods

We included 245 consecutive adult patients with mild-to-severe TBI. Their initial CT and status at hospital discharge (dead or alive) were reviewed, and both CT scores were calculated. We examined whether each score was related to early death; compared the two scoring systems' performance in predicting early death, and identified the CT findings that are independent predictors of early death.

## Results

More deaths occurred among patients with higher Marshall and Rotterdam scores (both _P_ < .05, Mann–Whitney _U_ test). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) indicated that both scoring systems had similarly good discriminative power in predicting early death (Marshall, AUC = 0. 85 vs. Rotterdam, AUC = 0.85). Basal cistern absence (odds ratio \[OR\] = 771.5, _P_ < .0001), positive midline shift (OR = 56.2, _P_ = .0011), hemorrhagic mass volume ≥25 mL (OR = 12.9, _P_ = .0065), and intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage (OR = 3.8, _P_ = .0395) were independent predictors of early death.

## Conclusions

Both Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems can be used to predict early death in patients with TBI. The performance of the Marshall score is at least equal to that of the Rotterdam score. Thus, although older, the Marshall score remains useful in predicting patients' prognosis.

Because traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity among young people worldwide, outcome prediction at admission is crucial for clinical decision making, resource allocation, and counseling of patients' families.

Computed tomography (CT) currently plays an important role in the rapid assessment of patients with TBI in that it detects posttraumatic hemorrhagic lesions and allows selection of patients who require emergency neurosurgery. To predict the outcome of patients with TBI, two scoring systems that use initial CT findings but group them differently have been introduced: Marshall score in 1991 which was followed by Rotterdam score in 2005 in an attempt to improve the performance yield in predicting patients' outcome. Both scoring systems are currently used widely in studies assessing patients with TBI either to show subject demographics or as independent predictor of patients' outcome .

Marshall Scoring System


Adapted from Mass et al. .


Score Definition 1 No visible intracranial pathology on computed tomography 2 Cisterns are present with 0–5 mm midline shift and/or lesion densities present; no high- or mixed-density lesion >25 mL includes bone fragments or foreign bodies 3 Cisterns compressed or absent with 0–5 mm midline shift; no high- or mixed-density lesion >25 mL 4 Midline shift >5 mm; no high- or mixed-density lesion >25 mL 5 Any lesion surgically evacuated 6 High- or mixed-density lesion >25 mL; not surgically evacuated

Table 4


Rotterdam Scoring System


CT Finding Score Definition Basal cistern 0 Normal 1 Compressed 2 Absent Midline shift 0 ≤5 mm 1 >5 mm EDH 1 Absent 0 Present SAH/IVH 0 Absent 1 Present

EDH, epidural hematoma; SAH/IVH, subarachnoid hemorrhage/intraventricular hemorrhage.


The final score (0–6) is calculated by summing the item scores and adding 1.

![Figure 1, A representative case showing how to calculate both computed tomography (CT) scoring systems. It is about a 93-year-old man who fell from a second floor and who showed a Glasgow coma scale of 6/15 at admission in the emergency room. The initial CT scan performed 6 hours after injury reveals the following: (1) According to Marshall score, a “hemorrhagic mass” made of left subdural hematoma (a–d) and right parietal intracerebral hematoma (d) . The overall volume of these hemorrhages measures >25 mL (95.6 mL). Because no surgical evacuation of the mass was done, the Marshall score was equal to 6, regardless of other CT findings, (2) According to Rotterdam score, the basal cistern appears compressed (a) (=1) with a positive midline shift ( b , brown line ) (≥5 mm) (=1). SAH/IVH is noted (a–c) (=1), but no EDH is found (=1). The sum score of these four CT items was 4. Thus, the overall Rotterdam score was 5, resulting from summing up each item +1. The patient died from TBI 24 hours after admission. EDH, epidural hematoma; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyCTFindingstoPredictEarlyDeathinPatientswithTraumaticBrainInjury/0_1s20S1076633214000464.jpg)

![Figure 2, Showing the discrepancy between the Marshall and Rotterdam scoring systems in patient with “hemorrhagic mass”. It is about an 83-year-old man who fell down the stairs and who showed a Glasgow coma scale of 10/15 at admission in the emergency room. His initial computed tomographic scan obtained 2 hours after injury reveals brain contusions (=hemorrhagic mass) involving the bases of bilateral frontal lobe. The total volume of the hemorrhagic mass was more than 25 mL (94.4 mL), and surgical removal of the lesion was not performed. In addition, SAH and nontraumatic lesion (ischemic changes) are also noted. The Marshall score was 6 (mass > 25 mL without surgical removal). In contrast, Rotterdam score was calculated as follows: normal basal cistern (=1) and no midline shift (=0), the EDH was absent (=1) and SAH/IVH was present (score = 1). The Rotterdam score was 2 + 1 = 3. The patient died 5 days after admission. EDH, epidural hematoma; IVH, intraventricular hemorrhage; SAH, subarachnoid hemorrhage.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyCTFindingstoPredictEarlyDeathinPatientswithTraumaticBrainInjury/1_1s20S1076633214000464.jpg)
