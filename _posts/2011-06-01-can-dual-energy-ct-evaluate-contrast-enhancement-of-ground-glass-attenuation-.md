## Rationale and Objectives

Evaluation of contrast enhancement of pulmonary lesions with ground-glass attenuation (GGA) is difficult with conventional techniques but might be possible using contrast-mapping images (CMIs) obtained by dual-energy computed tomography. To address this issue, a phantom study was conducted, and this technique was then applied to clinical cases.

## Materials and Methods

Phantoms made of agarose gel and those made of hollow resin clay, containing various concentrations of iodine or calcium, were used to simulate soft tissue and GGA, respectively. They were scanned using a dual-energy computed tomographic scanner, and the relationship between iodine concentration and calculated iodine value on CMIs was examined. The influence of calcium was also evaluated. In addition, contrast enhancement of 24 GGA lesions was evaluated on CMIs.

## Results

There was a good correlation between iodine value and iodine concentration in the soft-tissue models ( _r_ 2 = 0.996). In the GGA models, the former tended to exceed the latter when default parameters for calculating CMIs were used, but this could be corrected by modifying the parameters ( _r_ 2 = 0.998). The iodine value increased with calcium concentration in both models. On CMIs, contrast enhancement was visible in 22 adenocarcinomas but not in a pulmonary hemorrhage and an inflammatory change.

## Conclusions

Dual-energy computed tomography can evaluate contrast enhancement of GGA lesions.

Dual-energy computed tomographic (DECT) imaging was first introduced in 2005 by Siemens Medical Solutions (Forchheim, Germany) with the brand name Somatom Definition. This scanner has two x-ray tubes providing 80-kVp and 140-kVp x-rays. Using two different x-ray energies (dual-energy technique), different materials can be distinguished according to their inherent x-ray attenuation coefficients . New imaging techniques, such as lung perfusion imaging , bone-removed computed tomographic (CT) angiography , qualitative diagnosis of urinary stones , and tendon imaging in musculoskeletal system , have been reported using DECT imaging.

Liver virtual noncontrast (VNC) is a new application of the Somatom Definition and is available on the workstation. Using this application, components of contrast material can be extracted from the data sets of postcontrast images obtained using the dual-energy technique, creating VNC and “iodine-mapping” images. Therefore, contrast enhancement can be evaluated without unenhanced images. Our previous study showed that contrast enhancement of the aorta, liver, and pectoris major muscle was correlated with the iodine value obtained with this technique .

![Figure 2, Plot of computed tomographic (CT) numbers of materials at 140 and 80 kVp. According to the material decomposition theory, CT numbers of tissues behave in a linear manner on the regressed line (solid line) determined by two or more standard attenuations of the typical tissues (in this case, fat and soft tissue). If a tissue contains high-density materials (eg, iodine, calcium), its attenuation becomes larger at low kilovoltages than that at high kilovoltages (solid circle); therefore, the concentration of such material could be estimated (broken arrow).

![Figure 4, Relationship between computed tomographic (CT) numbers at 80 and those at 140 kVp. At low kilovoltage, actual CT numbers of the ground-glass attenuation (GGA) models were higher than predicted by default parameters (solid line) in the attenuation range of −520 to −640 Hounsfield units (HU). Linear regression revealed that by changing the default setting of fat attenuation (−110 HU) to −91 HU, the broken line for actual CT numbers of GGA samples almost perfectly matched the solid line.
