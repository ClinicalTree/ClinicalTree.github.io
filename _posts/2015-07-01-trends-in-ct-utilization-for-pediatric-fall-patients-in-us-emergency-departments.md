## Rationale and Objectives

Falls are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits in the United States. We evaluated trends in computed tomography (CT) utilization for pediatric fall victims in the United States from 2001 to 2010.

## Materials and Methods

Using the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2001 to 2010, we identified all visits of pediatric (aged <18 years) patients presenting to EDs after falls. This database surveys approximately 500 EDs per year for 4 weeks providing national estimates on ED resource utilization and outcomes. We studied trends in CT utilization and proportion of visits with life-threatening conditions after falls. We also studied the association between CT utilization rates and demographic characteristics and admission status.

## Results

A total of 9763 unweighted observations for a total of 32,432,686 pediatric fall patients were seen in US EDs from 2001 to 2010. The proportion of pediatric fall patients receiving CT increased from 5.3% in 2001 to a peak of 16.6% in 2009 and decreased to 11.3% in 2010, whereas the proportion of pediatric fall patients with life-threatening conditions fluctuated between 1.2% and 3.3% during this period. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, each increasing year was independently associated with CT utilization (odds ratio \[OR\], 1.15; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 1.14–1.16). Patients aged 0–1 years had higher odds of CT utilization than patients aged 13–17 years (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.26–2.27).

## Conclusions

There was a twofold increase in CT utilization among pediatric fall visits from 2001 to 2010. When controlling for demographic and clinical variables, increasing year was independently associated with CT utilization. These findings suggest that CT may be overutilized among pediatric fall patients.

Computed tomography (CT) utilization in the pediatric population has seen a rapid increase over the past decade in pediatric emergency departments (EDs) . It is estimated that at least 4 million CT scans are conducted each year on children in the United States . Diagnostic capability, wider availability, and prompt results make CT a preferred method of imaging in EDs across the United States . Falls account for the most ED visits in the pediatric population with relatively high rates of morbidity and mortality .

Recent studies indicate that nearly a quarter of all CTs ordered are inappropriate, thus subjecting patients to unnecessary radiation exposure . This is particularly concerning in the pediatric population, placing them at a potential risk for cancer, a risk that is cumulative over the patient's lifetime . Furthermore, unnecessary imaging is a significant contributor to the rising cost of health care in the United States . Because of these issues of safety and inappropriate use and cost, we undertook a study to evaluate CT utilization trends in the pediatric population and study the associated demographic and clinical features.
