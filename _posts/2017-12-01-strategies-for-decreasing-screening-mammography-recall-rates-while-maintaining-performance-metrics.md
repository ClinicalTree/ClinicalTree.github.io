## Rationale and Objective

This study aimed to determine the impact of interventions designed to reduce screening mammography recall rates on screening performance metrics.

## Materials and Methods

We assessed baseline performance for full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis mammography (DBT) for a 3-year period before intervention. The first intervention sought to increase awareness of recalls from screening mammography. Breast imagers discussed their perceptions regarding screening recalls and were required to review their own recalled cases, including outcomes of diagnostic evaluation and biopsy. The second intervention implemented consensus double reading of all recalls, requiring two radiologists to agree if recall was necessary. Recall rates, cancer detection rates, and positive predictive value 1 (PPV1) were compared before and after each intervention.

## Results

The baseline recall rate, cancer detection rate, and PPV1 were 11.1%, 3.8/1000, and 3.4%, respectively, for FFDM, and 7.6%, 4.8/1000, and 6.0%, respectively, for DBT. Recall rates decreased significantly to 9.2% for FFDM and to 6.6% for DBT after the first intervention promoting awareness, as well as to 9.9% for FFDM after the second intervention implementing group consensus. PPV1 increased significantly to 5.7% for FFDM and to 9.0% for DBT after the second intervention. Cancer detection rate did not significantly change with the implementation of these interventions. An average of 2.3 minutes was spent consulting for each recall.

## Conclusion

Reduction in recall rates is desirable, provided performance metrics remain favorable. Our interventions improved performance and could be implemented in other breast imaging settings.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide, with approximately 500,000 annual deaths due to disease-specific mortality. An estimated 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone, with 40,450 deaths from the disease in 2016 . Early detection with screening mammography leads to improved survival and less aggressive treatment, decreasing mortality from breast cancer by an estimated 19%–40% depending on age and breast tissue density .

Screening mammography benefits women with earlier detection, but less desirable outcomes may occur if a woman is recalled for additional evaluation and the result is ultimately benign. After a recall from screening mammography, a benign interpretation may occur with additional imaging alone. However, in some cases, large core needle biopsy or even surgery may be required to prove benignity. False-positive screening recalls and the resulting additional evaluation may cause significant psychological distress to women .
