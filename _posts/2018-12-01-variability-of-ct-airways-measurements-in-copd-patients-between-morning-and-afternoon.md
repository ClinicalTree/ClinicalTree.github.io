## Rationale and Objectives

Computed tomography (CT) airways measurements can be used as surrogates to spirometric measurements for assessing bronchodilation in a particular patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although spirometric measurements show variations within the opening hours of a hospital department, we aimed to compare the variability of CT airways measurements between morning and afternoon in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to that of spirometric measurements.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty patients had pulmonary function tests and CT around 8  am and 4  pm . Luminal area (LA) and wall thickness (WT) of third and fourth generation airways were measured twice by three readers. The percentage of airway area occupied by the wall (WA%) and the square root of wall area at an internal perimeter of 10 mm (√WAPi10) were calculated. The effects of examination time, reader, and measurement session on CT airways measurements were assessed, and the variability of these measurements was compared to that of spirometric measurements.

## Results

Variability of LA  3rd and LA  4th was greater than that of spirometric measurements ( _P_ values ranging from <.001 to .033). There was no examination time effect on √WAPi10, WT  3rd , LA  4th , or WA%  4th ( _P_ values ranging from .102 to .712). There was a reader effect on all CT airways measurements ( _P_ values ranging from <.001 to .028), except in WT  3rd ( _P_ _>_ .999). There was no effect of measurement session on any CT airway measurement ( _P_ values ranging from .535 to >.999).

## Conclusion

As the variability of LA  3rd and LA  4th is greater than that of spirometric measurements, clinical studies should include cohorts with larger numbers of patients when considering LA than when considering spirometric measurements as end points.

## Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by a persistent airflow limitation measured by spirometry . The major determinants of this limitation are pulmonary emphysema and airways disease, each of which coexists at various degrees in any given patient. The differences in degrees and varying relationships between determinants have suggested the need for phenotyping COPD . Computed tomography (CT)—through objective quantification of pulmonary emphysema and airways disease—could help in achieving clinically meaningful phenotyping . Although CT quantification of pulmonary emphysema has been extensively addressed , some studies have reported that airways disease could also be quantified at CT through several measurements obtained in proximal airways that are correlated to histologic measurements of distal airways : the wall thickness (WT); the luminal area (LA); the percentage of airway area occupied by the wall (WA%); and the square root of wall area at an internal perimeter of 10 mm (√WAPi10). Moreover, recent studies suggested that some of these CT airways measurements could be used as surrogate to spirometric measurements for assessing bronchodilation in a particular patient with COPD . Nevertheless, although spirometric measurements may show variations within the opening hours of a hospital department, the variability of the CT airways measurements as compared to that of spirometric measurements remains unknown . This knowledge could be of importance in the perspective of using CT airways measurements as end points instead of spirometric measurements . The purpose of our study was therefore to compare the variability of CT airways measurements between morning and afternoon in patients with COPD with that of spirometric measurements.

## Materials and Methods

## Subjects

Twenty consecutive ambulatory patients were recruited from the COPD clinic of our institution. This group comprised 14 men and 4 women who fulfilled the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria , including ≥40 years of age, smoking history of 10 pack-years or more, and a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV  1 /FVC) less than 0.7. These patients also fulfilled the following criteria: no COPD exacerbation or respiratory infection in the 4 weeks before the study; no concomitant pulmonary disease (eg, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis); no pulmonary resection; and no active malignancy or malignancy of any organ within the past 5 years. Age was 64 ± 11 years (mean ± standard deviation). COPD was graded as GOLD I in two patients, as GOLD II in 13 patients, as GOLD III in four patients, and as GOLD IV in one patient . Mean smoking history was 36 pack-years ± 13. On the same day, the patients performed twice pulmonary function tests (PFT) and chest CT scans: the first ones in the morning (around 8  am ) and the second ones in the afternoon (around 4  pm ). This schedule was arbitrarily chosen to cover the opening hours of an imaging department. Treatments in our 20 patients were short-acting β2-agonists (two patients), long-acting anticholinergics (six patients), combination of short-acting β2-agonists plus anticholinergics (eight patients), and combination of long-acting β2-agonists plus corticosteroids (four patients).
