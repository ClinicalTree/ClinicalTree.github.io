## Rationale and Objectives

To compare Hounsfield unit (HU) data obtained from true-unenhanced (TUE) and virtual-unenhanced (VUE) imaging obtained with a fast kv-switching dual-energy computed tomography (CT) scanner using multimaterial decomposition algorithm.

## Materials and Methods

In this Institutional Review Board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant, retrospective cohort study, CT scans of 19 patients undergoing multiphasic renal protocol abdominal CT on a fast kv-switching dual-energy CT scanner were reviewed. CT numbers were measured on the matched TUE and VUE generated using a multimaterial decomposition algorithm with selective iodine suppression, and postcontrast images at predefined locations in seven organs. Six hundred sixty regions of interest were placed at 132 locations. Agreement was assessed with paired _t_ test, Pearson's correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis.

## Results

Mean TUE and VUE measurements were not significantly different in the corticomedullary ( _P_ = 0.25) or nephrographic ( _P_ = 0.10) phases. There was a strong correlation between TUE and VUE CT numbers (corticomedullary: _r_ = 0.90, nephrographic: _r_ = 0.90, each _P_ < 0.001). Discrepancies ≥5 HU occurred 46 times (35%, 46 of 132) in the corticomedullary phase and 44 times (33%, 44 of 132) in the nephrographic phase. Discrepancies ≥10 HU occurred in 7% (9 of 132 in both corticomedullary and nephrographic phases). Interphase, intrasubject VUE CT numbers were strongly correlated ( _r_ = 0.93, _P_ < 0.001), but discrepancies ≥5 HU (22% \[29 of 132\]) and ≥10 HU (2% \[3 of 132\]) occurred. There was no significant correlation between the true postcontrast CT number and the magnitude of VUE-TUE discrepancy ( _r_ = −0.04, _P_ = 0.6).

## Conclusion

CT numbers on VUE images generated from fast kv-switching dual-energy CT scans strongly correlate with TUE CT numbers on a population basis, but commonly vary 5–9 HU on a per-patient basis.

## Introduction

One of the principal advantages of dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is its ability to derive material-specific information using material decomposition algorithms that analyze the change in attenuation of tissues between the low and high-energy scans . This enables differentiation of materials with a high atomic number (eg, iodine) from those with a low atomic number (eg, soft tissue, water). With fast kv-switching DECT, a “basis material decomposition algorithm” is used to generate material-specific information that enables selective identification of iodine on contrast-enhanced DECT and generation of virtual unenhanced (VUE) images . However, unlike with dual-source DECT, in which material decomposition is performed in image space, material decomposition with fast kv-switching DECT is performed in projection space, which has limited the ability of users to translate the VUE data into Hounsfield units (HU) .

An advanced material analysis algorithm known as multimaterial decomposition (MMD) has recently been made available for clinical use, and extends the material discrimination capability of fast kv-switching DECT to more than two materials . As opposed to VUE images generated using an iodine:water material basis pair, in which the image pixels containing iodine are removed, with MMD algorithm image voxels of iodine are replaced by voxels simulating the same volume and attenuation of blood that would have been displaced by the iodine . These images are referred to as material suppressed iodine (MSI) images, and they enable measurement of HU in the VUE images . If accurate, they would allow the translation of these virtual HU data into commonly used attenuation-based diagnostic algorithms (eg, renal mass and adrenal nodule characterization) that rely on specific HU criteria to discriminate benign from potentially malignant pathology .
