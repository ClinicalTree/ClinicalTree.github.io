_Practical Fluoroscopy of the GI and GU Tracts_ is a splendid textbook in many ways. Initially, I wondered how this book could be different than all of the other gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) imaging primers. But I quickly discovered that this text has several unique features that set it apart from similar texts, and it is a welcome addition to my library.

The book is divided into two sections: GI tract and GU tract. The GI section is divided by anatomy-based chapters, which begin at the pharynx and conclude with the colon. The GU tract is subdivided into fluoroscopic evaluation of the bladder, urethra, and urinary diversions and retrograde pyelography. In addition to providing a succinct but ample discussion of radiographic findings and differential diagnoses for the major pathological conditions of the GI and GU tract, the authors dedicate a significant portion of the manual to detailed but easy-to-follow descriptions of fluoroscopic techniques. I personally found the technique sections to be exceedingly helpful and a feature that sets this text apart from other frequently used GI and GU primers, such as _Mayo Clinic Gastrointestinal Imaging Review, Gastrointestinal Imaging: Case Review Series,_ and _Genitourinary Imaging: Case Review Series_ . Another unique and valuable feature of the book is the time dedicated to normal postoperative findings and postoperative complications, which are one of the most common indications for fluoroscopic exams in modern-day practice. Furthermore, the book contains more than 600 beautiful illustrations including both normal anatomy and abnormal GI and GU pathology.

The relatively lightweight hardcover text is not burdensome to transport. This book is well suited for first-year radiology residents trying to survive their first fluoroscopy rotation, as well as practicing radiologists wanting to brush up on fluoroscopy techniques and findings. The illustrations would be an excellent review to senior residents and fellows studying for boards.

The authors of _Practical Fluoroscopy of the GI and GU Tracts_ succeeded at their intention to produce a comprehensive text intended to serve as a primer for radiology residents as well as practicing radiologists. Not only did they produce a well-written primer on GI and GU pathology and postsurgical findings with wonderful illustrations, but they also provided clear and concise descriptions of the most common fluoroscopy techniques.
