## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of our study is to determine what information in medical student residency applications predicts radiology residency success as defined by objective clinical performance data.

## Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of residents who entered our institution's residency program through the National Resident Matching Program as postgraduate year 2 residents and completed the program over the past 2 years. Medical school grades, selection to Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) Honor Society, United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) scores, publication in peer-reviewed journals, and whether the applicant was from a peer institution were the variables examined. Clinical performance was determined by calculating each resident's cumulative major discordance rate for on-call cases the resident read and gave a preliminary interpretation. A major discordance was defined as a difference between the preliminary resident and the final attending interpretations that could immediately impact the care of the patient. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine significant variables.

## Results

Twenty-seven residents provided preliminary reports on call for 67,145 studies. The mean major discordance rate was 1.08% (range 0.34%–2.54%). Higher USMLE Step 1 scores, publication before residency, and election to AOA Honor Society were all statistically significant predictors of lower major discordance rates ( _P_ values 0.01, 0.01,  and <0.001, respectively).

## Conclusions

Overall resident performance was excellent. There are predictors that help select the better performing residents, namely higher USMLE Step 1 scores, one to two publications during medical school, and election to AOA in the junior year of medical school.

## Introduction

Radiology remains a competitive specialty and has been bolstered by the addition of interventional radiology as an independent residency . As such, there continues to be a large competitive pool of applicants. Predicting which of these students will make the best radiology residents therefore remains one of the most daunting tasks for program directors and residency selection committees.

Applicants to radiology residency programs use the Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) to submit their applications and supporting documents to their selected programs. This information includes demographic data, objective data including medical school transcripts, election to Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) Honor Society, United States Medical Licensure Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 scores, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and subjective data including letters of recommendation, dean's letter, and the applicant's personal statement. Residency program directors and selection committees review the information provided through ERAS to help identify which applicants they think will become the best radiology residents. The importance assigned to each piece of information varies between residencies. Grantham surveyed radiology program directors and found that an overwhelming majority considered medical school grades, class rank, and selection to AOA to be very important factors, whereas roughly half emphasized USMLE scores . Only a handful of studies have investigated whether these variables can predict future success in a radiology residency. In one such study, the authors were unable to demonstrate any statistically significant value of USMLE scores in predicting performance on the American Board of Radiology (ABR) written and oral examinations . Another group of investigators found that medical school grades in some preclinical and clinical courses and USMLE scores could predict success on the ABR examinations but did not predict performance during radiology residency rotations .
