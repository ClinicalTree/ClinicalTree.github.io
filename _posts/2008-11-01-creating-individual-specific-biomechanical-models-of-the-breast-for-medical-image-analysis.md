## Rationale and Objectives

Anatomically realistic biomechanical models of the breast potentially provide a reliable way of mapping tissue locations across medical images, such as mammograms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. This work presents a new modeling framework that enables us to create biomechanical models of the breast that are customized to the individual. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities by creating models of the left breasts of two volunteers and tracking their deformations across MRIs.

## Materials and Methods

We generate customized finite element models by automatically fitting geometrical models to segmented data from breast MRIs, and characterizing the in vivo mechanical properties (assuming homogeneity) of the breast tissues. For each volunteer, we identified the unloaded configuration by acquiring MRIs of the breast under neutral buoyancy (immersed in water). Such imaging is clearly not practical in the clinical setting; however, these previously unavailable data provide us with important data with which to validate models of breast biomechanics. Internal tissue features were identified in the neutral buoyancy images and tracked to the prone gravity-loaded state using the modeling framework.

## Results

The models predicted deformations with root-mean-square errors of 4.2 and 3.6 mm in predicting the skin surface of the gravity-loaded state for each volunteer. Internal tissue features were tracked with a mean error of 3.7 and 4.7 mm for each volunteer.

## Conclusions

The models capture breast shape and internal deformations across the images with clinically acceptable accuracy. Further refinement of the framework and incorporation of more anatomic detail will make these models useful for breast cancer diagnosis.

Breast cancer diagnosis involves the careful examination and analysis of clinical images across multiple views and imaging modalities including x-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. In analyzing these images, the clinician must interpret the image patterns (noting that each modality measures a different quantity, mammograms measuring x-ray radiation) and track suspicious lesions across these views to determine their state. Apart from the complexity of inferring and mapping across different image patterns, the analysis is further complicated by the fact that the breast is a soft biologic tissue. Its shape changes significantly during any imaging procedure because of mechanical loads such as gravity or compression. Consequently, internal tissue configurations are substantially different across the images that are obtained for diagnosis.

To alleviate these difficulties, significant efforts have been made in the field of image registration ( ). Traditionally, registration algorithms have used image intensityâ€“based statistics, such as mutual information, to determine the optimal transformation for aligning the images ( ). However, the transformations are free form and therefore do not necessarily give physically plausible alignments. To this end, there is increasing interest in the development of biomechanical models of the breast that simulate the deformations and constrain the transformations to be physically admissible ( ).
