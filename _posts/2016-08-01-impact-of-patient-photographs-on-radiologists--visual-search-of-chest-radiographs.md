## Rationale and Objectives

To increase detection of mislabeled medical imaging studies, evidence shows it may be useful to include patient photographs during interpretation. This study examined how inclusion of photographs impacts visual search.

## Materials and Methods

Ten radiologists participated. Average age was 43.00 years and average years Board-certified was 9.70, with 2 residents, 1 general, 2 abdominal, 4 cardiothoracic, and 1 pediatric radiologist. They viewed 21 portable chest radiographs with and without a simultaneously acquired photograph of the patient while visual search was recorded. Their task was to note placement of lines and tubes.

## Results

Presence of the photograph reduced the number of fixations (chest radiograph only mean 98.68; chest with photograph present 80.81; photograph 10.59; p < 0.0001) and total dwell (chest radiograph only mean 30.84 seconds; chest radiograph with photograph present 25.68; photograph 3.93; p < 0.0001) on the chest radiograph as a result of periodically looking at the photograph. Overall viewing time did not increase with addition of the photograph because time not spent on the radiograph was spent on the photograph. On average, readers scanned from the radiograph to the photographs about four times during search. Men and non-cardiothoracic radiologists spent significantly more time scanning all the images, including the photographs. Average preference for having photographs was 6.10 on a 0–10 scale, and neck and chest were preferred as areas to include in the photograph.

## Conclusion

Photographs may help with certain image interpretation tasks and may help personalize the reading experience for radiologists without increasing interpretation time.

## Introduction

The Institute of Medicine's Committee on Quality of Health Care in America estimated that as many as 98,000 people die each year from medical errors . In radiology, a potential source of error is the _wrong-patient error_ , which happens when a patient's radiograph is incorrectly filed under a different patient's folder in the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). For example, one Pennsylvania study demonstrated that 196 of 652 (30.1%) error events in radiology in 1 year that resulted in serious patient harm were wrong-patient errors .

To minimize such identification errors, The Joint Commission in its National Patient Safety Goals outlines the requirement of including at least two patient identifiers when providing care, treatment, and services. These identifiers may include the individual's name, an assigned medical record number, telephone number, or other person-specific identifier, such as date of birth or social security number . However, when mobile or portable radiographs are obtained in high-stress environments outside of the radiology department, such as in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit (ICU), where patients often cannot accurately provide identification information due to sedation, intoxication, alteration in consciousness, or inability to communicate for other reasons, the setting is ripe for wrong-patient errors to occur .
