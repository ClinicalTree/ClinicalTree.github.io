_Pediatric Imaging_ is one of 12 handbooks in the _Direct Diagnosis in Radiology_ series ( _Dx-Direct_ ). Other radiology subspecialties covered include brain, gastrointestinal, cardiac, breast, genitourinary, vascular, spine, head and neck, musculoskeletal, chest, and interventional. The book is organized into seven sections: lung and mediastinum, cardiovascular system, neck, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, musculoskeletal system, and central nervous system. Ninety-nine pediatric radiology cases are presented in a concise and clear manner. Each case is broken down into sections on definition, imaging signs, clinical aspects, differential diagnosis, and tips and pitfalls. Selected references are also included for additional reading.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It can easily be read in just a few days and can also serve as a quick reference to carry in your lab coat pocket. The quality of the images is particularly good, with major findings clearly labeled. Multiple modalities are shown, along with excellent diagrams and tables for many of the cases. The differential diagnosis and the tips and pitfalls sections are also very well done and, in my opinion, the strength of the book.

_Pediatric Imaging_ would be a good introductory text for medical students or junior radiology residents beginning pediatric radiology rotations. It would also serve as a quick review for residents preparing for written or oral boards. General radiologists may find it helpful as a basic reference during their average workdays. In short, the authors succeeded in fulfilling the goal of this series: succinct, high-yield presentations of commonly encountered pediatric radiology cases.
