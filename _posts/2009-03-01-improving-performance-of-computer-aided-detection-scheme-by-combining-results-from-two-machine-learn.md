## Rationale and Objectives

Global data–based and local instance–based machine-learning methods and classifiers have been widely used to optimize computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) schemes to classify between true-positive and false-positive detections. In this study, the correlation between these two types of classifiers was investigated using a new independent testing data set, and the potential improvement of a CAD scheme's performance by combining the results of the two classifiers in detecting breast masses was assessed.

## Materials and Methods

The CAD scheme first used image filtering and a multilayer topographic region growth algorithm to detect and segment suspicious mass regions. The scheme then used an image feature–based classifier to classify these regions into true-positive and false-positive regions. Two classifiers were used in this study. One was a global data–based machine-learning classifier, an artificial neural network (ANN), and the other was a local instance–based machine-learning classifier, a _k_ -nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. An independent image database including 400 mammographic examinations was used in this study. Of these, 200 were cancer cases and 200 were negative cases. The preoptimized CAD scheme was applied twice to the database using the two different classifiers. The correlation between the two sets of classification results was analyzed. Three sets of CAD performance results using the ANN, KNN, and average detection scores from both classifiers were assessed and compared using the free-response receiver-operating characteristic method.

## Results

The results showed that the ANN achieved higher performance than the KNN algorithm, with a normalized area under the performance curve (AUC) of 0.891 versus 0.845. The correlation coefficients between the detection scores generated by the two classifiers were 0.436 and 0.161 for the true-positive and false-positive detections, respectively. The average detection scores of the two classifiers improved CAD performance and reliability by increasing the AUC to 0.912 and reducing the standard error of the estimated AUC by 14.4%. The detection sensitivity was also increased from 75.8% (ANN) and 65.9% (KNN) to 80.3% at a false-positive detection rate of 0.3 per image.

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates that two global data–based and local data–based machine-learning classifiers (ANN and KNN) generated low correlated detection results and that combining the detection scores of these two classifiers significantly improved overall CAD performance ( _P_ < .01) and reduced standard error in CAD performance assessment.

Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) has emerged as a rapidly developing and promising technology in assisting radiologists with reading and interpreting screening mammograms , as well as other medical images. Most CAD schemes for mammography typically involve three stages in an attempt to automatically detect suspicious beast lesions and classify their likelihood of being malignant. The first stage uses image filtering and threshold methods to detect initially suspicious pixels or areas. The second stage applies a region growth or segmentation algorithm to define the lesion areas and the boundary contours. From the segmented lesion area, a set of image features is then extracted and computed. The third stage uses a pretrained machine-learning classifier to classify between true-positive and false-positive detections. A large number of supervised machine-learning methods have been investigated and tested for this purpose, which include, but are not limited to, linear discriminant analysis , decision trees , artificial neural networks (ANNs) , Bayesian belief networks , support vector machines , rule-based expert systems , information-theoretic-based template matching , and _k_ -nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms . Although these classifiers use different machine-learning concepts and methods, they basically can be divided into two categories, namely, global data–based and local instance (data)–based machine-learning methods .

The object of a global data–based machine-learning method is to train a classifier that generates a “global” optimization function to cover the entire instance space. For example, an ANN is a typical classifier trained using the global data–based machine-learning method. The advantage of an ANN is that it provides a robust approach to approximate general and explicit target functions with potentially noisy or incomplete training data. A local data–based machine-learning method is an instance-based “lazy” learning method. Instead of estimating the global target function once for the entire instance space, a local-based machine-learning method estimates the target function locally and differently for each new queried instance to be classified. The KNN algorithm is one of the most widely used classifiers when using a local data–based machine-learning method. Similar to an adaptive approach, an important advantage of the KNN algorithm is that it provides an option of selecting a different hypothesis or local approximation to the target function for each unknown (or test) query.
