Colon and rectal cancer accounts for 8.0% of all new cancers with estimated 132,700 new cases and 49,700 deaths in 2015 . The National Colorectal Cancer Round Table views colorectal cancer as a major public health problem . The Round Table has brought together more than 170 organizations committed to screening 80% of eligible patients for colorectal cancer by 2018. Such goals reflect the increased emphasis on population health. One challenge is to determine appropriate test(s) for screening colon and rectal cancer.

As the US health care system moves more toward population health and more prospective approaches to care, different models will be implemented. This is an aspect of the shift from volume to value. Models such as Accountable Care Organizations shift from a fee for service model to a shared risk model. Incentives, goals, what is measured, and what is paid for will change. This change in alignment of incentives will change the practice of medicine and impact everyone throughout the spectrum of health—well-being, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

In this setting, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement developed the Triple Aim . These guidelines for changes, improvements, and new models in health care suggest that we need to simultaneously optimize three dimensions:

- improving the patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction);

- improving the health of the population;

- reducing the per capita cost of health care.
