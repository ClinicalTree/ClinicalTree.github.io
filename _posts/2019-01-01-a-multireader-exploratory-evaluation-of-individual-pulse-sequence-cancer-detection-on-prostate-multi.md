## Rationale and Objectives

To determine independent contribution of each prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) sequence to cancer detection when read in isolation.

## Materials and Methods

Prostate mpMRI at 3-Tesla with endorectal coil from 45 patients ( _n_ = 30 prostatectomy cases, _n_ = 15 controls with negative magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\] or biopsy) were retrospectively interpreted. Sequences (T2-weighted \[T2W\] MRI, diffusion-weighted imaging \[DWI\], and dynamic contrast-enhanced \[DCE\] MRI; _N_ = 135) were separately distributed to three radiologists at different institutions. Readers evaluated each sequence blinded to other mpMRI sequences. Findings were correlated to whole-mount pathology. Cancer detection sensitivity, positive predictive value for whole prostate (WP), transition zone, and peripheral zone were evaluated per sequence by reader, with reader concordance measured by index of specific agreement. Cancer detection rates (CDRs) were calculated for combinations of independently read sequences.

## Results

44 patients were evaluable (cases median prostate-specific antigen 6.83 \[ range 1.95–51.13\] ng/mL, age 62 \[45–71\] years; controls prostate-specific antigen 6.85 \[2.4–10.87\] ng/mL, age 65.5 \[47–71\] years). Readers had highest sensitivity on DWI (59%) vs T2W MRI (48%) and DCE (23%) in WP. DWI-only positivity (DWI+/T2W−/DCE−) achieved highest CDR in WP (38%), compared to T2W-only (CDR 24%) and DCE-only (CDR 8%). DWI+/T2W+/DCE− achieved CDR 80%, an added benefit of 56.4% from T2W-only and of 42% from DWI-only ( _P_ < .0001). All three sequences interpreted independently positive gave highest CDR of 90%. Reader agreement was moderate (index of specific agreement: T2W = 54%, DWI = 58%, DCE = 33%).

## Conclusions

When prostate mpMRI sequences are interpreted independently by multiple observers, DWI achieves highest sensitivity and CDR in transition zone and peripheral zone. T2W and DCE MRI both add value to detection; mpMRI achieves highest detection sensitivity when all three mpMRI sequences are positive.

## Introduction

Prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become an established method for localizing clinically significant prostate cancer and for informing subsequent treatment planning decisions . The technique combines anatomical data from T2-weighted (T2W) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with functional data from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI to provide up to 90% reported sensitivity in detection of significant disease . mpMRI interpretation inherently relies on findings across multiple sequence images; however, the degree to which each pulse sequence contributes to overall detection sensitivity remains unclear.

Perception of the contribution of each pulse sequence has evolved. Initial Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines for standardization of prostate MRI interpretation assumed equal diagnostic weight for each of the three sequences; whereas the current PI-RADS version 2 (PI-RADSv2) has weighted sequences differently depending on the lesion location within the prostate . The change was based on expert consensus and zone-focused data reflecting possibly optimal cancer detection in the transition zone (TZ) from T2W MRI sequences and in the peripheral zone (PZ) from DWI sequences . However, these studies, along with recent PI-RADSv2 validations, are almost always based on mpMRI evaluations using complete mpMRI sets . In this context, conclusions about the value of individual sequences in cancer detection are subject to innate reader bias as each sequence validates the other in the reader's mind. Moreover, such studies are often based on a single institution's experience. As a result, there is continued uncertainty about the true value of each mpMRI sequence in cancer detection. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to determine the independent contribution of each prostate mpMRI sequence to cancer detection when read in isolation.
