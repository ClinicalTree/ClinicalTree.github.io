I recently read the centennial-related history of the American Registry of Radiologic Technology (ARRT). It took me 13 years to get a copy, a couple of weeks to read it, and only a few minutes to realize that here is the story of one of the most solid and productive organizations in all of radiology.

For those who knew less than I did, the ARRT is the organization that offers examinations to those who complete radiologic training programs and wish to attain national or state credentials in radiologic technology. It was founded in 1922 with the joint sponsorship of the Radiological Society of North America and the American Society of X-ray Technologists. It went through struggles and growth pains, a few lawsuits, and a sponsorship shift from the RSNA to the American College of Radiology. It set the national standard for education and proficiency in the basic branches of radiologic technology—diagnostic, therapeutic, and nuclear imaging—plus 12 subspecialty certifications. It provides the national standard and active examination for all of the state licensure programs as well as the voluntary credentialing program that is its patrimony.

As of 1995, when the history was written, the ARRT had some 220,000 registrants who, among them, held 270,000 credentials in basic and subset criteria. In the decade and more since, the number of individuals with ARRT certificates rose to 278,668 as of spring 2008 with those people holding almost exactly 400,000 certificates.

Just as the American Board of Radiology certifies physicians, the ARRT examines and certifies the technical staff of hospitals and radiology offices. There was a time when those passing the ARRT test were asked to sign a statement that they would only work for medical doctors. But that faded with time and reality.

When the ARRT started, its board consisted of three radiologists named by the RSNA. Edward W. Rowe of Lincoln, Nebraska, was president; Byron C. Darling of New York City was vice president; and Benjamin Orndoff of Chicago was the third trustee. Much of the early organization and test construction were done by Edward Jerman, widely regarded as one of the pioneers of x-ray technology and author of several key textbooks and manuals. Its office was in Omaha, where H. S. Tyler served as exective secretary. The first certificant was a nun, Sister M. Beatrice Merrigan. By 1927, the registry had 432 registrants, 352 women, and 890 men. Of the women, 64% were nurses and 43% were nuns.

In 1934, H. S. Tyler was ousted and the office was moved to St. Paul, Minnesota. Al Greene, a recovering tuberculosis patient, took on the management and ran things from a basement room in the Glen Lake Sanitarium for several years. Then he was pronounced cured and continued to operate the registry until 1965.
