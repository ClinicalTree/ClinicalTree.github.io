## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to assess the effect of matrix size on the spatial resolution and image quality of ultra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT).

## Materials and Methods

Slit phantoms and 11 cadaveric lungs were scanned on U-HRCT. Slit phantom scans were reconstructed using a 20-mm field of view (FOV) with 1024 matrix size and a 320-mm FOV with 512, 1024, and 2048 matrix sizes. Cadaveric lung scans were reconstructed using 512, 1024, and 2048 matrix sizes. Three observers subjectively scored the images on a three-point scale (1 = worst, 3 = best), in terms of overall image quality, noise, streak artifact, vessel, bronchi, and image findings. The median score of the three observers was evaluated by Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction. Noise was measured quantitatively and evaluated with the Tukey test. A _P_ value of <.05 was considered significant.

## Results

The maximum spatial resolution was 0.14 mm; among the 320-mm FOV images, the 2048 matrix had the highest resolution and was significantly better than the 1024 matrix in terms of overall quality, solid nodule, ground-glass opacity, emphysema, intralobular reticulation, honeycombing, and clarity of vessels ( _P_ < .05). Both the 2048 and 1024 matrices performed significantly better than the 512 matrix ( _P_ < .001), except for noise and streak artifact. The visual and quantitative noise decreased significantly in the order of 512, 1024, and 2048 ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

In U-HRCT scans, a large matrix size maintained the spatial resolution and improved the image quality and assessment of lung diseases, despite an increase in image noise, when compared to a 512 matrix size.

## Introduction

Advances in computed tomography (CT) have revolutionized diagnostic imaging. Various techniques, such as high-resolution CT, which was introduced in the 1980s, contributed to improvements in the spatial resolution of CT imaging . Recently, ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT), which has smaller detector element and x-ray tube focus size than those of conventional CT, has become commercially available. Kakinuma et al. reported that a prototype U-HRCT provided better image quality of lung nodules than conventional CT . They also reported that the spatial resolution of the U-HRCT was 0.12 mm, whereas that of conventional CT ranged from 0.23 mm to 0.35 mm .

As for matrix size, 512 × 512 has been used in conventional CT, but larger matrix sizes, such as 1024 × 1024 and 2048 × 2048, are available with U-HRCT. When the reconstruction of the field of view (FOV) is set to 320 mm to cover the entire lung, the theoretical size of 1 pixel in an image matrix is 0.625 mm for 512 × 512; 0.313 mm for 1024 × 1024; and 0.156 mm for 2048 × 2048 (  Fig 1 ).  Table 1 shows the theoretical size of 1 pixel according to matrix size and FOV reconstruction. We hypothesized that the size of 1 pixel in a smaller matrix image is much larger than the maximum spatial resolution of an U-HRCT scanner and insufficient to demonstrate the high spatial resolution of U-HRCT; on the other hand, a large matrix size may maintain the spatial resolution and improve the image quality of lung CT.

When the field of view is 320 mm, the theoretical size of 1 pixel in an image matrix is 0.625 mm for 512 × 512; 0.313 mm for 1024 × 1024; and 0.156 mm for 2048 × 2048.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofMatrixSizeontheImageQualityofUltrahighresolutionCToftheLung/0_1s20S1076633217305044.jpg)
