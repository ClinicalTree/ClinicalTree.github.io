## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for targeting prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels.

## Materials and Methods

Pubmed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify suitable studies published from January 2001 to October 2013. Polled estimation and subgroup analysis data were obtained using a random effect model. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance.

## Results

Fourteen studies involving 698 patients met the included criteria. The mean prostate cancer detection rate was 37.5%. Twelve studies had a pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 88%, 69%, and 16.84 by patient analysis, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy (MRSI) provided higher pooled sensitivity (91%) and specificity (69%) compared with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). MRSI combined with MRI had the highest pooled specificity (73%). By site analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR in nine studies were 57%, 90%, and 14.34, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, MRSI combined with MRI showed higher pooled sensitivity (58%) and specificity (93%) compared with T2WI. Diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) showed the highest pooled specificity: 95% but the lowest pooled sensitivity: 38%.

## Conclusions

A limited number of studies suggest that the value of MRI to target prostate cancer in patients with previous negative biopsies and elevated PSA levels appears significant. MRI combined with MRSI is particularly accurate. Further studies are necessary to confirm the eventual role of DWI in this field.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the Western European countries and the second cause of cancer-related fatality among male population in the United States, and the incidence has increased significantly in the developing world . At present, the diagnosis of prostate cancer is mainly based on the digital rectal examination (DRE) and evaluation of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Abnormal findings are usually followed up by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)–guided biopsy . Random biopsies of the prostate by TRUS stand for the gold standard of prostate cancer detection for patients with elevated PSA levels. However, because of the high false-negative rates and very low false-positive rates of initial TRUS-guided biopsy (TRUS-GB), patients may still have cancer despite a negative biopsy . Patients with previous negative biopsy results and persistently increasing PSA levels require repeat biopsies, which negatively affect their quality of life. A number of different techniques for prostate repeat biopsy have been developed, including saturation biopsy or active surveillance of PSA. It has been shown that the use of saturation biopsy techniques, which obtain greater number of prostate cores, has no advantage over standard TRUS-GB with respect to cancer detection rate . Furthermore, PSA monitoring may miss the significant prostate cancer . In addition, PSA-based screening is inadequate for detecting prostate cancer at earlier stages according to the recommendation of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has developed rapidly and gives the potential to improve prostate cancer diagnosis. MRI has a higher sensitivity for detecting prostate cancer than TRUS. Some attempts have been made to use MRI for MRI-guided biopsies (MRI-GB). Several studies have reported the use of MRI-GB with the patient in the prone position . However, MRI-GB is not commonly available and has some disadvantages as compared to TRUS-GB. The procedures are time-consuming and costly, and the prone position makes patient uncomfortable, especially for elderly or sick patients . Targeted prostate biopsy, which uses findings from MRI to guide needle aiming, may help to establish correct diagnosis for patients with prior negative biopsy. Using MRI to target suspicious areas on repeat biopsy might improve the chances of detecting a significant cancer. Targeting biopsies might also avoid saturation biopsy. It also has the advantage on detecting prostate cancers missed previously, particularly those outside the peripheral zone . Nowadays, the use of T1- and T2-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI), MR spectroscopy imaging (MRSI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), and various combinations of these in multiparametric imaging protocols have been reported for the identification of prostatic lesions for targeted biopsy . The objective of this study was to summarize the currently available bulk of information to assess the diagnostic efficacy of MRI for targeting cancer in patients with previous prostate negative biopsies and persistently elevated PSA levels.
