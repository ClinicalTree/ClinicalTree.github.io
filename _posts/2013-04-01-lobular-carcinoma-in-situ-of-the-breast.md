## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to review the imaging findings associated with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the breast with clinical and pathological correlation.

## Materials and Methods

A database search of patients treated at our institution from 2002 to 2011 identified 26 patients with LCIS associated with an imaging abnormality that had imaging available for review. LCIS was diagnosed by core-needle or excision biopsy. Patients subsequently underwent excisional biopsy, mastectomy, or clinical follow-up. Patients' mammography, ultrasonography (US), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images were reviewed using the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lexicon together with relevant clinical and pathology data.

## Results

The 26 patients had 31 imaging lesions that yielded a histological diagnosis of LCIS by image-guided core-needle biopsy ( _n_ = 29) or excision biopsy ( _n_ = 2). Twenty-eight of 31 (90%) lesions yielding LCIS had a mammographic abnormality, 3/20 (15%) lesions had a US abnormality, and 6/7 (86%) had an abnormality on contrast-enhanced MRI. Calcifications were the most common mammographic finding, seen in 25/31 (80%) lesions. All three lesions seen on US were masses; the majority was irregular, hypoechoic, avascular, and had posterior shadowing. Non–mass-like enhancement was seen in five (71%) lesions with an MRI abnormality. Two (7%) patients developed subsequent malignancy at follow-up.

## Conclusion

LCIS can have associated imaging abnormalities, most commonly grouped amorphous calcifications on mammography, a shadowing, avascular, irregular, hypoechoic mass on US, or heterogeneous non–mass-like enhancement with persistent enhancement kinetics on MRI.

Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is an uncommon, noninvasive lesion of the breast first described by Foote and Stewart in 1941. Histopathologically, it is a proliferation of atypical monotonous epithelial cells filling and distending the acinar units of a lobule. Depending on the appearance of these cells, LCIS can be categorized as classic or pleomorphic. LCIS is frequently multifocal and/or multicentric and often occurs bilaterally . Patients diagnosed with LCIS have an increased risk of invasive breast malignancy; Bodian et al reported an overall cumulative risk of breast cancer of 30%–35% in women who had had LCIS. It is generally accepted that both breasts are at increased risk of malignancy rather than only the breast where LCIS was detected , but not all studies show equal risk for both breasts . There is also some evidence of a precursor-product relationship between LCIS and invasive lobular carcinoma . LCIS has been described as clinically undetectable and with no known distinguishing radiologic features. It is often believed to be an incidental histopathological finding on image-guided or excisional biopsy that is performed for and targeted at a separate lesion . By retrospectively reviewing cases of LCIS directly associated with imaging findings which were the target for biopsy, we seek to better understand the spectrum of imaging findings that prompt image-guided biopsy and yield a diagnosis of LCIS. The histopathology and clinical outcomes of these patients were also documented.

## Materials and methods

## Patient Selection

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study, which complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. We performed a database search of patients treated at our institution from January 1, 2002, to August 31, 2011, to identify all cases of LCIS associated with an imaging abnormality for which imaging findings were available for review. The single institution is a tertiary referral cancer center, where approximately 2000 patients are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. A total of 19,000 core-needle biopsies (CNB) were performed during the study period, 1994 of which yielded LCIS. Patients had to have been diagnosed with LCIS by image-guided CNB or excisional biopsy (EB), and LCIS had to be the highest grade lesion at the biopsy site. A total of 1963 of 1994 (98%) biopsies yielded LCIS as an incidental finding. We identified 26 patients with 31 LCIS lesions that met our inclusion criteria of LCIS associated with an imaging finding. Our institution's electronic medical record was used to gather patients' demographic and clinical information.
