## Rationale and Objectives

The American College of Radiology has recently endorsed the use of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) for colon cancer screening. With advances in technology and postprocessing software, the quality of computed tomographic colonographic studies has improved, and new techniques are being developed to reduce radiation exposure and increase patient acceptance of the procedure. The aim of colorectal cancer screening is to reduce the incidence of malignancy by identifying and removing presymptomatic lesions. The aim of this study was to answer the clinical question: In an asymptomatic patient at average risk for colon cancer, is CTC equivalent to optical colonoscopy (OC) for detecting clinically significant polyps?

## Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate CTC compared to OC, using the patient, intervention, comparison intervention, outcome (PICO) search strategy. The PubMed search used Medical Subject Headings, including the terms “computed tomography colonography,” “colonoscopy,” “screening,” and “polyp.” Each of the retrieved articles was assigned a level of evidence using the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's hierarchy of validity for diagnostic studies.

## Results

PICO search criteria and review of abstracts identified 16 relevant studies. Using the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's hierarchy of validity, there were three level 1c studies, two level 2a studies, three level 2b studies, four level 3b studies, two level 4 studies, and two level 5 studies. All relevant studies demonstrated that CTC had high or moderately high per patient and per polyp sensitivity and specificity compared to OC for clinically relevant polyps (>5 mm).

## Conclusions

The majority of evidence suggests that CTC is an acceptable alternative to OC, particularly in the group of patients who are either unwilling or unable to undergo OC. The results of the large, multicenter American College of Radiology Imaging Network study are pending. This trial presented preliminary results in 2007 suggesting that the sensitivity and specificity of CTC are high and comparable to those of OC.

Currently, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer to affect adults in North America, and the approximate lifetime risk for developing this cancer in men is 6.7%, compared to 6.1% in women . In the majority of cases, the precursor to developing this type of cancer is a polyp, so screening has been advocated since the 1990s. The aim of CRC screening is to reduce the incidence of malignancy by identifying and removing presymptomatic lesions, thereby reducing CRC morbidity and mortality . However, only 42% of Americans aged >50 years have undergone any type of screening, including fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or optical colonoscopy (OC) . Numerous factors have been postulated to be related to the low screening rates, including a lack of awareness, patient discomfort, socioeconomic causes, and a lack of availability .

Recently, the American College of Radiology endorsed the use of computed tomographic colonography (CTC) for screening patients for colon cancer. CTC was first described in 1994 by Vining et al as a method for evaluating the colonic lumen. This technique has been significantly refined over the past decade, initially being used as a problem-solving tool for patients with incomplete colonoscopy or equivocal barium enema results. More recently, CTC has been investigated as a screening modality for patients at average risk for developing CRC. With advances in technology and postprocessing software, the quality of the resulting studies has improved, and new techniques are being developed to reduce patient radiation exposure and increase patient acceptance of the procedure. With CTC as a minimally invasive alternative to OC, it is possible that more people may be willing to undergo CRC screening, possibly resulting in the earlier detection of abnormalities, increasing the likelihood of successful intervention, and ultimately reducing the number of CRC deaths.
