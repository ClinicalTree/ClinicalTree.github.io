## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to correlate acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging velocities with the pathology results and to evaluate the ability of ARFI in distinguishing benign from malignant breast lesions.

## Materials and Methods

B-mode ultrasonography (US) and ARFI were performed in patients with previously diagnosed and selected breast lesions for biopsy. Shear wave velocity (SWV) was measured inside lesions and in the surrounding parenchyma ( _m/s_ ). SWV measurements as well as lesion-to-parenchyma ratio (LPR) were compared between benign and malignant lesions, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted. Two blinded readers independently classified the lesions as benign or malignant in two separate reading sessions, one using B-mode US alone and the other using a combined set of B-mode US and ARFI.

## Results

Eighty-one patients with a total of 92 breast lesions were included (57 benign and 35 malignant nodules). SWV inside lesions were significantly higher for malignant neoplasms compared to benign (medians of 9.1 m/s vs 3.5 m/s; _P_ < 0.001). LPR was also significantly higher for malignant lesions (3.0 vs 1.4; _P_ < 0.001). Parenchyma SWV had no differences between groups ( _P_ = 0.071). ROC curves showed a significant discriminative power for lesion SWV (area under the curve \[AUC\] = 0.980; _P_ < 0.001) and LPR (AUC = 0.954; _P_ < 0.001). For lesion measures, a cutoff of 6.593 m/s was obtained, with sensitivity and specificity of 88.6% and 96.5%, respectively.

## Conclusions

ARFI provides quantitative elasticity measurements, adding valuable complementary information to B-mode ultrasound, that can potentially help in breast lesion characterization and assisting the decision for biopsy recommendations.

## Introduction

Ultrasonography (US) is a useful technique that has been increasingly used as an important diagnostic tool complement to mammography in differentiating benign from malignant breast tumors . Although US depicts more cancers than mammography alone, it has a considerable number of false-positives, which also leads to a higher number of benign mass biopsies .

In the last decades, US technology has experienced several advances, including real-time elastography, which evaluates tissue stiffness, detecting its displacement after slight manual compression . Information is converted into color-scale images and is superimposed to B-mode images. Knowing that malignant tumors tend to be stiffer and that benign masses are usually softer , real-time elastography is used as a complementary technique in addition to B-mode sonography, increasing its specificity (83.1% vs 76.9% for B-mode US alone) . However, this technique has some limitations. The first, and perhaps the most important, is the fact that it is operator dependent and has a higher interobserver variability, because it requires compression with the probe, preventing lateral or angulated movements, to obtain good quality images . Besides variability caused by technical limitations, there is also a certain degree of subjectivity in image interpretation . Another limitation is that real-time elastography only provides qualitative information, although ratios between the lesion and surrounding breast parenchyma can be calculated .
