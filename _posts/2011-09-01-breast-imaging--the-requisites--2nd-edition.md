One of a 12-book series aimed at providing the essential information in each of the main imaging subspecialties for radiology trainees and professionals, _Breast Imaging: The Requisites_ lives up to the high standards set by the other volumes in the series. The text is well organized and clear, covering the need-to-know facts in the area of breast imaging. Images are high quality and well chosen to illustrate key mammographic, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging and 2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomographic/computed tomographic findings. At the conclusion of each chapter, key elements are summarized. Short quizzes are included for many of the chapters, reinforcing these concepts.

The opening chapter is dedicated to discussing mammographic acquisition, including screen-film and digital mammography, the Mammography Quality Standards Act, and computer-aided detection. Included figures demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate mammographic techniques and various artifacts that may be encountered in breast imaging. Toward the end of the chapter, there is a useful outline of the Mammography Quality Standards Act equipment requirements, professional qualifications, and quality assurance programs.

The following chapters cover mammographic interpretation, mammographic analysis of breast calcifications, mammographic and ultrasound analysis of breast masses, breast ultrasound, mammographic and ultrasound-guided breast biopsy procedures, and magnetic resonance imaging of breast cancer and magnetic resonance imaging–guided breast biopsy. Special considerations and workup are covered in the final chapters: breast cancer treatment–related imaging and the postoperative breast, breast implants and the reconstructed breast, clinical breast problems and unusual breast conditions, and 2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and the evaluation of breast cancer.

Importantly, the American College of Radiology’s Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon is used throughout the chapters. Within the chapter on clinical breast problems and unusual breast conditions, there is a thorough and clear discussion of probably benign (BI-RADS category 3) findings, a topic that often causes confusion among radiologists and nonradiologists alike. If there were one area I would like to see expanded for the next edition, it would be the discussion of the appropriate use of BI-RADS categories and how these categories should be used to direct patient management.

Overall, _Breast Imaging: The Requisites_ is an excellent text, covering the essential information in the field of breast imaging. Although perhaps not in-depth enough for breast imaging specialists, this text would certainly be useful for general practice radiologists and other medical professionals with an interest in breast disease. For radiology residents learning how to operate in a breast clinic and preparing for board exams, _Breast Imaging: The Requisites_ is ideal.
