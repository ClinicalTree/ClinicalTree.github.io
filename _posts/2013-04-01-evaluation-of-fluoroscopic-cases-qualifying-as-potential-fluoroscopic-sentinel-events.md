## Rationale and Objectives

To address the risk of radiation injury during interventional procedures, the Joint Commission has defined prolonged fluoroscopy resulting in a cumulative skin dose of 15 Gy or more to a single field as a reviewable sentinel event. The goal of this work is to present a system for identifying potential fluoroscopic sentinel events (FSE) and describing common case characteristics.

## Materials and Methods

Criteria based on fluoroscopic time (FT) > 150 minutes and reference air kerma (RAK) > 6 Gy were used to identify potential sentinel events. Case information including procedure type, number of procedures, and radiation dose parameters was recorded. Peak skin dose (PSD) was calculated by a medical physicist. Values were compared between procedure types and the relationship between FT, RAK, and PSD was evaluated.

## Results

Between 2008 and 2011, 183 events exceeding the investigation criteria were identified in three interventional categories: cardiology (54%), neuroradiology (31%), and vascular (16%). The average number of procedures/patient was 1.7 ± 0.1, with the majority (59.6%) having undergone only one procedure. Most cases could be identified using the RAK criterion alone (96.7%). Based on the PSD/RAK ratio, a threshold RAK of 7.5 Gy would effectively identify all cases that would exceed 15 Gy in PSD.

## Conclusion

Radiation delivered during interventional cases can place patients at risk of cutaneous radiation injury and potential sentinel events. Using appropriate thresholds to determine which cases require detailed investigation allows efficient utilization of department resources for identifying sentinel events.

As interventional procedures in surgery, cardiology, and radiology have become more prevalent, the risk of radiation-related injuries has become a substantial concern. Prolonged use of radiation during fluoroscopically guided interventional (FGI) procedures can subject patients to a large dose and place them at risk for radiation injury . Effects of high doses of radiation to the skin can range from mild transient erythema to severe necrosis requiring surgical intervention .

To facilitate awareness of radiation overexposure and drive process improvements to enhance patient safety, in 2005 the Joint Commission created a reviewable sentinel event that applied to fluoroscopic procedures. The fluoroscopic sentinel event (FSE) was defined as prolonged fluoroscopy resulting in a cumulative skin dose of 15 Gy or more to a single field. According to guidance from the Joint Commission, this dose may be accumulated either during a single procedure or multiple procedures over 6 months to a year . When a sentinel event occurs, a root cause analysis must be performed to address underlying systems issues that can improve patient safety.
