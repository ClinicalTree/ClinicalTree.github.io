## Rationale and Objectives

To determine if background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on screening breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in high-risk women correlates with future cancer.

## Materials and Methods

All screening breast MRIs ( _n_ = 1039) in high-risk women at our institution from August 1, 2004, to July 30, 2013, were identified. Sixty-one patients who subsequently developed breast cancer were matched 1:2 by age and high-risk indication with patients who did not develop breast cancer ( _n_ = 122). Five fellowship-trained breast radiologists independently recorded the BPE. The median reader BPE for each case was calculated and compared between the cancer and control cohorts.

## Results

Cancer cohort patients were high-risk because of a history of radiation therapy (10%, 6 of 61), high-risk lesion (18%, 11 of 61), or breast cancer (30%, 18 of 61); BRCA mutation (18%, 11 of 61); or family history (25%, 15 of 61). Subsequent malignancies were invasive ductal carcinoma (64%, 39 of 61), ductal carcinoma in situ (30%, 18 of 61) and invasive lobular carcinoma (7%, 4of 61). BPE was significantly higher in the cancer cohort than in the control cohort ( _P_ = 0.01). Women with mild, moderate, or marked BPE were 2.5 times more likely to develop breast cancer than women with minimal BPE (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% confidence interval: 1.3–4.8, _P_ = .005). There was fair interreader agreement (κ = 0.39).

## Conclusions

High-risk women with greater than minimal BPE at screening MRI have increased risk of future breast cancer.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is the most common and second most deadly cancer in women, responsible for over 230,000 new diagnoses and 40,000 deaths yearly in the United States . Although there are many factors that may increase an individual woman's breast cancer risk, women are generally considered high-risk if their lifetime risk of breast cancer is greater than or equal to 20% . For these women, the American Cancer Society and the American College of Radiology recommend supplemental screening with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . Published meta-analyses demonstrate a sensitivity of greater than 90% for MRI . Furthermore, screening with MRI in high-risk women is cost-effective, and the effectiveness increases with increased patient risk . As a result, screening MRI for high-risk women is one of the more common indications for breast MRI in clinical practice today.

Although the primary goal of high-risk screening MRI is to identify current cancer, the ability to predict future breast cancer would improve risk stratification for women and could lead to more personalized screening strategies. The association between increased breast density on mammography and future breast cancer is well established, but the corresponding relationship between background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) on MRI and breast cancer risk is less well known . Use of computer vision algorithms to quantify various BPE metrics have had mixed results in predicting future breast cancer, in part because of different methods of quantifying BPE . Two reader studies evaluating high-risk screening MRI suggest that increased BPE is associated with future breast cancer, but these studies were limited based on small sample sizes and reliance on single or dual readers, which limits the generalizability because of interobserver variability in BPE measurements . To build on this promising work, additional studies with more patients as well as multiple readers are needed.
