## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of single-inhalation xenon-enhanced computed tomography (XeCT) to provide clinically practical, high-resolution pulmonary ventilation imaging to clinics with access to only a single-energy computed tomography scanner, and to reduce the subject's overall exposure to xenon by utilizing a higher (70%) concentration for a much shorter time than has been employed in prior studies.

## Materials and Methods

We conducted an institutional review board-approved prospective feasibility study of XeCT for 15 patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy. For XeCT, we acquired two breath-hold single-energy computed tomography images of the entire lung with a single inhalation each of 100% oxygen and a mixture of 70% xenon and 30% oxygen, respectively. A video biofeedback system for coached patient breathing was used to achieve reproducible breath holds. We assessed the technical success of XeCT acquisition and side effects. We then used deformable image registration to align the breath-hold images with each other to accurately subtract them, producing a map of lung xenon distribution. Additionally, we acquired ventilation single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (V-SPECT-CT) images for 11 of the 15 patients. For a comparative analysis, we partitioned each lung into 12 sectors, calculated the xenon concentration from the Hounsfield unit enhancement in each sector, and then correlated this with the corresponding V-SPECT-CT counts.

## Results

XeCT scans were tolerated well overall, with a mild (grade 1) dizziness as the only side effect in 5 of the 15 patients. Technical failures in five patients occurred because of inaccurate breathing synchronization with xenon gas delivery, leaving seven patients analyzable for XeCT and single-photon emission computed tomography correlation. Sector-wise correlations were strong (Spearman coefficient >0.75, Pearson coefficient >0.65, _P_ value <.002) for two patients for whom ventilation deficits were visibly pronounced in both scans. Correlations were nonsignificant for the remaining five who had more homogeneous XeCT ventilation maps, as well as strong V-SPECT-CT imaging artifacts attributable to airway deposition of the aerosolized imaging agent. Qualitatively, XeCT demonstrated higher resolution and no central airway deposition artifacts compared to V-SPECT-CT.

## Conclusions

In this pilot study, single-breath XeCT ventilation imaging was generally feasible for patients undergoing thoracic radiotherapy, using an imaging protocol that is clinically practical and potentially widely available. In the future, the xenon delivery failures can be addressed by straightforward technical improvements to the patient biofeedback coaching system.

## Introduction

Xenon (Xe) is a radio-opaque and inert gas; therefore, it may be a viable and safe gas-phase computed tomography (CT) contrast agent to quantify regional pulmonary ventilation in humans. In order for such a contrast agent to be adopted widely, several clinical traits must be met: safety, convenience for the patient, and ease of implementation. Numerous studies have already explored the technical advantages of xenon-enhanced computed tomography (XeCT), such as its ability to provide reasonably safe high-resolution ventilation images. Dual-energy XeCT has been reported in patient and phantom studies , but most XeCT studies, to date, have used a multiple breath-hold technique in which patients inhale xenon for 1–2 minutes to reach equilibrium before image acquisition and xenon washout .

There have also been research efforts to compare XeCT against currently available three-dimensional ventilation imaging, that is, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) . Substantial agreement has recently been observed between XeCT and krypton-81m (Kr-81m) ventilation SPECT images in an intermodality blind analysis of lung ventilation defects . With this result lending further credence to the use of gas-phase CT contrast agents for ventilation imaging, we aim to further expand upon its potential for future clinical implementation. By increasing the relative xenon concentration by a factor of two relative to prior studies, but reducing the xenon exposure to a single breath-hold duration (a factor of 5 or more reduction in exposure time compared to the studies noted earlier), a more rapid image acquisition may be possible with an overall reduction in patients' total exposure to xenon gas, a known anesthetic agent.

The application of this ventilation apparatus was integrated into the clinical simulation workflow, and the hardware can all easily fit onto a small pushcart adjacent to the computed tomography couch.

Vessel registration mismatch artifacts manifest as adjacent bright and dark lines , which are subsequently reduced with vessel-guided deformable image registration. Image (e) shows the three-dimensional displacement vector map between the two subsequent inspiration computed tomography scans with O 2 and Xe. Because of the inspiration reproducibility gained with the video biofeedback system, the required deformation was minimal between the two breath-hold scans.
