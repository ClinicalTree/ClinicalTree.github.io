Cambridge University Press’s book _Clinical MR Spectroscopy: Techniques and Applications_ was an absolute pleasure to review. Admittedly, I may be a bit biased because of my personal connections to magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), but I tried my best to put that into context as I read through this work. This book is supremely well organized and presented in a very clear and aesthetic format, with many color-enhanced fonts. The figures were delightful, including many color images and many multimodality correlations. Probably the most impressive aspect of this book to me were the tables; for example, see Table 11.1, “Classification of Hereditary Metabolic Disorders with the Characteristic Metabolic MRS Findings.” I cannot even imagine how much work must have gone into putting together this extremely efficient table in particular, let alone in combination with the remainder of the tables.

This book struck me as easily portable, and the price/value ratio seems favorable. Adding to this value are chapters “MRS in prostate cancer,” “MRS in breast cancer,” and “MRS in musculoskeletal disease.” Of course, the majority of the book pertains to proton MRS of brain, but a robust introduction to the techniques of MRS and heteronuclear spectroscopy are also included. Many literature references are included. A rare suggestion for improvement would be for the book to include an additional chapter on MRS of the spinal cord.

This book is probably best suited to be a ready reference source for an individual or group that routinely uses MRS. I also found this book to be easily read and also easily searchable. These are formidable characteristics indeed.
