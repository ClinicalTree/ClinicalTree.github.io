## Rationale and Objectives

Shear wave elastography (SWE) has been shown to be a powerful tool to estimate tissue stiffness. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of SWE to that of standard ultrasound (US) (combined use of B-mode US and power Doppler \[PD\] US) for diagnosing tendinopathies.

## Materials and Methods

This is a prospective institutional review board–approved study on 112 participants (mean age 42 ± 13.4 years) with chronic (>6 months) tendon pain in Achilles, patellar, or epicondylar tendons. Participants were systematically examined with US, PD, and SWE using a high-resolution linear 15 MHz probe (SuperSonic Imagine). A semiquantitative analysis of SWE color charts and a quantitative region of interest-based analysis of tendon elasticity were performed. SWE values of symptomatic and healthy tendons were compared by using Student _t_ test. Clinical symptom scores served as the standard of reference. US findings were compared to clinical symptom scores by using Spearman correlation.

## Results

At semiquantitative analysis of SWE color charts, symptomatic tendons were rated as “soft” in 80/140 (57.1%), as “intermediate” in 54/140 (38.6%), and as “rigid” in 6/140 (4.3%).

Healthy tendons were rated as “soft” in 8/84 (10%), as “intermediate” in 31/84 (37%), and as “rigid” in 45/84 (53%). At quantitative analysis, symptomatic tendons exhibited significantly lower mean SWE values (60.3 kPa/4.48 m/s; range 15.3–201.4 kPa/2.26–14.18 m/s) than healthy tendons (185 kPa/7.85 m/s; range 56–265 kPa/4.32–9.23 m/s) ( _P_ = 0.0004). SWE values correlated closely with patients' clinical symptoms obtained by clinical scores (r = 0.81). Overall sensitivity of conventional US and PD in detecting tendinopathies could be enhanced from 67.1% (94/140) to 94.3% (132/140) when combined with SWE.

## Conclusions

SWE is a simple way to estimate tissue stiffness and, by reduced tissue rigidity, to identify tendon pathology. SWE significantly increases the diagnostic accuracy of tendon sonography and may prove to be a sensitive tool to early detect or monitor tendinopathy.

## Introduction

Tendinopathies of Achilles and patellar tendons are common orthopedic overuse injuries, especially among sportsmen or athletes . The pathophysiology of both chronic tendon pain and chronic tendon injury, potentially leading to tendon rupture, begins with a prolonged phase of accumulation of subclinical microdamage .

![Figure 1, Semiquantitative evaluation of tendon stiffness by shear wave elastography (SWE). Tissue rigidity of tendons was assessed semiquantitatively by color charts (a–c) . In every tendon, three equal Q-box measurements (1 cm 2 ) were performed in the proximal, mid-, and distal tendon parts (sagittal view). If tendon changes were visible at B-mode, at least one of these SWE measurements was performed in the most conspicuous area seen at B-mode ultrasound (US). Tendon stiffness then was grouped into “soft” (a) , “intermediate” (b) , or “rigid” (c) , according to SWE color chart. (a) Blue: low/soft tissue rigidity, (b) turquoise: intermediate tissue rigidity, (c) yellow to red: high/hard tissue rigidity.
