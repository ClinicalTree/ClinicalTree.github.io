## Rationale and Objectives

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) images can be reconstructed with thinner slice thickness on some modern multidetector-row computed tomography scanners without additional radiation. We hypothesized that the isotropic 0.5-mm CAC reconstruction outperforms the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction in detecting and quantifying coronary calcium, and we proposed to compare them by validating against spatially registered intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter-virtual histology (IVUS-VH).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-seven patients were enrolled, and 5976 mm of coronary arteries were analyzed. A semiautomatic software was developed to coregister CAC and IVUS-VH on a detailed slice-by-slice basis. Calcium detection and calcium volume quantification were evaluated and compared using varying calcium attenuation thresholds. Algorithms for deriving individualized optimal threshold and comparable Agatston score on the 0.5-mm reconstruction were developed.

## Results

The isotropic 0.5-mm reconstruction achieved significantly higher area under receiver-operating curve than the conventional 3.0-mm reconstruction (0.9 vs. 0.74, _P_ < .001). Using the optimal threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction had higher sensitivity (0.79 vs. 0.65), specificity (0.85 vs. 0.77), positive predictive value (0.42 vs. 0.29), and negative predictive value (0.97 vs. 0.94) than the 3.0 mm. Individualized optimal threshold was significantly correlated with the image noise (r = 0.66, _P_ < .001) in the 0.5-mm reconstruction.

## Conclusions

By optimizing the calcium threshold, the 0.5-mm reconstruction is superior to the conventional 3.0-mm in detecting and quantifying calcium, which may improve the clinical value of CAC without additional radiation.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is a noninvasive, low-radiation computed tomography (CT)-based imaging technique that quantifies the calcium in the coronary vasculature . It provides a well-validated risk stratification scheme for future cardiovascular events . CAC studies were originally developed and validated on the electron-beam CT scanner (EBCT) , and were quantified by calculating the Agatston score and/or the volume score , in which a minimum attenuation value of 130 Hounsfield unit (HU) is typically used as the threshold to detect coronary calcium. Recent studies have shown that the fixed 130-HU threshold may not be optimal for detecting calcium , and a scanner-specific and individualized attenuation threshold is more desirable .

With the increasing popularity and accessibility of multidetector-row CT (MDCT), CAC studies are now typically performed on MDCT scanners. To make the CAC quantification on the MDCT comparable to the original EBCT, current MDCT-based CACs are reconstructed with a 3.0-mm slice thickness, which is the typical collimation thickness on the EBCT scanners. However, CAC volumes acquired on most MDCT scanners can be reconstructed with thinner slice thickness because of MDCT's smaller detector size. For example, CAC images can be acquired volumetrically using a prospective single-rotation protocol on a 320-detector-row CT scanner. Because of the 0.5-mm collimation thickness, CAC images can be reconstructed with the 0.5-mm slice thickness to achieve an isotropic resolution without increasing the radiation dose. Compared to 3.0 mm, thinner slice thickness potentially reduces partial volume artifact and may improve the sensitivity/specificity and accuracy in quantifying calcium. Some studies reported that the thinner-slice reconstruction resulted in significantly higher Agatston and volume scores and was able to identify more subclinical calcification lesions. On the other hand, some researchers found that the image noise level was significantly higher in the thinner-slice reconstructions, and the conventional threshold of 130 HU leads to more false positives. Mühlenbruch et al. empirically used the threshold of 350 HU in the 1.0-mm reconstruction. However, little is known about the optimal calcium threshold in thinner-slice reconstructions.
