## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluates the influence of the calibrated luminance level of medical displays in the detectability of microcalcifications and spiculated lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis images.

## Materials and Methods

Four models of medical displays with calibrated maximum and minimum luminance, respectively, ranging from 500 to 1000 cd/m  2 and from 0.5 to 1.0 cd/m  2 , were investigated. Forty-eight studies were selected by a senior radiologist: 16 with microcalcifications, 16 with spiculated lesions, and 16 without lesions. All images were anonymized and blindly evaluated by one senior and two junior radiologists. For each study, lesion presence or absence and localization statements, interpretative difficulty level, and overall quality were reported. Cohen's kappa statistic was computed between monitors and within or between radiologists to estimate the reproducibility in correctly identifying lesions; for multireader-multicase analysis, the weighted jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic statistical tool was applied.

## Results

Intraradiologist reproducibility ranged from 0.75 to 1.00. Interreader as well as reader-truth agreement values were >0.80 and higher with the two 1000 cd/m  2 luminance displays than with the lower luminance displays for each radiologist. Performances in the detectability of breast lesions were significantly greater with the 1000 cd/m  2 luminance displays when compared to the display with the lowest luminance value ( _P_ value <0.001).

## Conclusions

Our findings highlight the role of display luminance level on the accuracy of detecting breast lesions.

## Introduction

The interpretation of mammographic images may be challenging due to the subtle differences in soft tissue densities of normal and pathological structures of the breast, and diagnosis benefits from the detection of microcalcifications and the assessment of masses' borders. Mammographic interpretations are based on the evaluation of morphologic descriptors well established by the Breast Imaging Reporting And Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon . However, they can be applied only if a lesion is perceived on mammographic studies. The radiologist's expertise may be hampered if mammographic images are of bad quality or if they are improperly visualized. For this reason, great attention must be given to mammographic images' presentation devices, both film view box and softcopy display devices, whose wrong choice or improper setup can compromise the overall quality of mammographic examination. Regarding mammographic displays, the ACR-AAPM-SIIM Practice Guideline for Determinants of Image Quality in Digital Mammography recommends that monitors used for interpretation be specifically approved for digital mammography use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with a spatial resolution of 5 megapixel (MP) in a 21” panel . Regarding the luminance level, a calibrated maximum luminance of at least 400 cd/m  2 is required and greater than 450 cd/m  2 is recommended, but an increased display luminance level is welcome, being the human eye ability to detect difference in contrast and fine details affected by overall brightness of a scene. As concerns the calibrated minimum luminance level, no value is specified in the mentioned guidelines.

In literature, several observer performance studies are reported comparing the diagnostic accuracy among displays of different spatial resolutions , but only a few authors have investigated the role of display luminance level . Furthermore, to our knowledge, the diagnostic performance of medical displays dedicated to mammography with different setup has been poorly investigated. In the paper of Kimpe and Xthona, an increased level of calibrated maximum luminance is proven to increase the detection probability of breast microcalcifications . Briefly, increasing the calibrated maximum luminance of a medical display from 500 cd/m  2 to 1000 cd/m  2 increases the detection probability of microcalcifications between 13% and 20%, as a function of the parameter used in the Weibull psychometric function. The results presented in the mentioned article have been obtained only on the basis of the Barten's model of the contrast sensitivity curve, and the authors themselves, in the conclusion of their study, suggested the activation of an observational study to support the presented results.
