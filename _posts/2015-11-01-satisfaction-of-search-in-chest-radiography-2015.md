## Rationale and Objectives

Two decades have passed since the publication of laboratory studies of satisfaction of search (SOS) in chest radiography. Those studies were performed using film. The current investigation tests for SOS effects in computed radiography of the chest.

## Methods

Sixty-four chest computed radiographs half demonstrating various “test” abnormalities were read twice by 20 radiologists, once with and once without the addition of a simulated pulmonary nodule. Receiver-operating characteristic detection accuracy and decision thresholds were analyzed to study the effects of adding the nodule on detecting the test abnormalities. Results of previous studies were reanalyzed using similar modern techniques.

## Results

In the present study, adding nodules did not influence detection accuracy for the other abnormalities ( _P_ = .93), but did induce a reluctance to report them ( _P_ < .001). Adding nodules did not affect inspection time ( _P_ = .58) so the reluctance to report was not associated with reduced search. Reanalysis revealed a similar decision threshold shift that had not been recognized in the early studies of SOS in chest radiography ( _P_ < .01) in addition to reduced detection accuracy ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

The nature of SOS in chest radiography has changed, but it is not clear why.

## Advances in Knowledge

SOS may be changing as a function of changes in radiology education and practice.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated a satisfaction of search (SOS) effect in chest radiography, with reduced accuracy in detecting native abnormalities on chest radiographs in the presence of simulated pulmonary nodules . Various abnormalities were missed when a pulmonary nodule was present (SOS condition), but detected when the nodule was absent (non-SOS condition). The original experiment on SOS effects in chest radiography was conducted 25 years ago and the most recent replication 15 years ago. Both of those studies demonstrated a reduction in detection accuracy as a function of SOS. The practice of radiology has changed significantly in the last 2 decades. Film has given way to digital imaging. The utilization of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) examinations has dramatically increased, and advanced imaging is often the preferred initial examination. Resolution and quality of those modalities have improved significantly. There have been corresponding changes of emphasis in the training of radiologists.

![Figure 1, Constructs for the experimental conditions. The non–satisfaction of search (SOS) condition presents without a pulmonary nodule (a) and the SOS condition presents with a pulmonary nodule (b) . The same native abnormality, a Zenker's diverticulum with residual barium, appears in both (a) ( white arrow ) and (b) . A simulated pulmonary nodule has been digitally placed in b ( white arrow ). In all other respects, the two images are identical.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SatisfactionofSearchinChestRadiography2015/0_1s20S1076633215003244.jpg)

Cross symbols represent receiver-operating curve (ROC) points from the non–satisfaction of search (SOS) condition and open symbols represent ROC points from the SOS condition. These points suggest that detection accuracy as measured by ROC curves through the points would not differ between the conditions. (b) It provides a magnified view of the most lenient operating points in (a) to highlight differences in those points between the treatment conditions. Each point is the average of 20 readers. Cross symbols represent ROC points from the non-SOS condition and open circle symbols represent ROC points from the SOS condition. These points suggest a major threshold shift toward more conservative reporting in the SOS condition (Note that the chance line shown in the other figures is not visible in this Figure because the ranges of true and false positive fractions do not overlap in the magnified view).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SatisfactionofSearchinChestRadiography2015/1_1s20S1076633215003244.jpg)
