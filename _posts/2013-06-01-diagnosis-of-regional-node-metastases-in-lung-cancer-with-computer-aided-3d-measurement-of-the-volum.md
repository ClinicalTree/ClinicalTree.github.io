## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study is to assess the usefulness of computer-aided three-dimensional (3D) measurement of volume and computed tomography (CT) attenuation values of nodes for diagnosing nodal metastases of lung cancer.

## Materials and Methods

We measured three diameters, their ratios, volume, and CT values in 3D images of 191 nodes (64 malignant; 162 of <1 cm in short diameter) in 26 consecutive patients who underwent contrast-enhanced, thin-section, multidetector row CT before surgery. We separately studied statistically significant factors in a group of all nodes and in another group of nodes of <1 cm in short diameter with logistic modeling and evaluated their diagnostic accuracy.

## Results

Significant factors were CT values ( _P_ < .001) and short diameter ( _P_ = .001) for the total node group, and CT values ( _P_ = .030) and 3D volume ( _P_ = .035) for the <1 cm node group. Optimal 83% accuracy was obtained with a criterion of short diameter of >7.4 mm and CT values of >103 Hounsfield unit (HU) for the total node group, whereas optimal 76% accuracy was obtained with a criterion of 3D volume of >1282 mm  3 or CT values of >103 HU for the <1 cm node group.

## Conclusion

3D measurement may be useful for diagnosing nodal metastases.

Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is staged based on the TNM classification system, because appropriate therapy depends on the staging of cancer as determined by this system and because prognosis of patients correlates well with the staging of NSCLC . Presence or absence of lymph node metastasis and its site (N-staging) are one of the three major factors of TNM system. Overall survival rates decrease as N-staging of NSCLC advances; a 5-year survival rate (56%) of patients with pathological N0 (pN0) disease was significantly better than that (38%) with pN1 disease, which was significantly better than that (22%) with pN2 disease .

Although various noninvasive and (semi)invasive procedures are used for staging NSCLC, computed tomography (CT) is initially employed and a widely used imaging technique for this purpose . Diagnosis with CT of nodal metastasis in NSCLC depends only on the diameters of nodes in two-dimensional images; at present, transverse short diameter of 1 cm is generally adopted for prediction of nodal metastasis . However, a meta-analysis reported poor sensitivity of 51% with 86% specificity of CT for identifying mediastinal node metastasis . To our knowledge, there is no literature in which three-dimensional (3D) measurements with computer-aided volume and CT attenuation values of regional nodes were applied to predict nodal metastasis in NSCLC.

(a) Intravenous contrast-enhanced thin-section computed tomography (CT) demonstrated multiple lymph nodes in #4L, #5, and #6. (b) Swollen node ( green color ) in #5 was semiautomatically segmented from surrounding structures with computer assistance. CT attenuation values and areas of the node in transverse plane were automatically calculated. Greatest and shortest diameters in transverse plane were also measured. (c) Surface rendering 3D image of segmented node was depicted. Mean CT attenuation values and volume of the node were automatically calculated with computer assistance. Greatest vertical diameter was also measured.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DiagnosisofRegionalNodeMetastasesinLungCancerwithComputerAided3DMeasurementoftheVolumeandCTAttenuationValuesofLymphNodes/0_1s20S1076633213000354.jpg)
