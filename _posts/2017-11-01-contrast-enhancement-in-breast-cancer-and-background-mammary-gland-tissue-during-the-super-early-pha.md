## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to compare the contrast enhancement between tumor and mammary-gland tissue to distinguish lesions in the super-early phase, during which minimal contrast media uptake is observed in mammary-gland tissue.

## Materials and Methods

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, including the super-early phase with bolus tracking (BT) method (to determine the optimal imaging start time), was performed by using identical parameters to obtain transverse fat-suppressed T1-weighted images of both breasts. The percent enhancement (PE) and the contrast ratio (CR) indicators for tumor and mammary-gland tissue were assessed in each dynamic phase.

## Results

The PE values of the tumor were 62.4% and 151.6%, and those of the mammary gland were 0.3% and 20.7% in the super-early and early phases, respectively. Therefore, virtually no background parenchymal enhancement was observed in the super-early phase. The variation in the PE values during the super-early phase was significantly smaller when the values were determined with the BT method ( _P_ < .05). The CR was highest in the early phase, and the CR in the super-early phase was lower than in the other phases. Early-phase PE and CR were significantly higher in invasive cancer cases than in noninvasive cancer cases ( _P_ < .01). A significant difference in the imaging start time was observed for the anatomic side factor by the BT method.

## Conclusion

Background parenchymal enhancement almost never appeared in the super-early phase, but the CR was lower in the super-early phase than in the early phase. The BT method allowed for an optimal imaging start time for the super-early phase and yielded images with less deviation of contrast enhancement.

## Introduction

The increase in breast cancer-related morbidity has led to the widespread use of mammography, ultrasonography, and diagnostic imaging modalities in screenings and clinical examinations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is particularly considered useful for breast cancer examination. The American Cancer Society guidelines recommend MRI screening for patients with a lifetime breast cancer risk of >20% . High-field MRI facilitates higher resolution and faster imaging. When combined with the use of contrast media (CM), MRI can be used to detect breast cancer and examine its spread as well . The use of CM in MRI for breast cancer diagnosis is considered essential by many guidelines . In particular, dynamic MRI is recommended to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. For breast cancer, images are obtained at the early phase, wherein contrast enhancement peaks approximately 60–120 seconds after CM injection, and at the delay phase to confirm CM washout .

The menstrual cycle and other factors impact contrast enhancement in normal mammary-gland tissue . However, the number of contrast-enhanced breast MRI sessions that can be conducted daily is limited in some institutions; hence, it may not be possible to schedule examinations based on the menstrual cycle. In such cases, during conventional dynamic MRI, the CM is also taken up by mammary-gland tissue, sometimes even outside the menstrual cycle, which decreases the contrast with tumor tissue because of background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). Uematsu et al. reported that BPE negatively affects the detection, diagnosis, and staging of breast cancer . BPE is expected to be lower in the super-early phase because normal mammary-gland tissue becomes enhanced more slowly than tumors do . Based on this expectation, super-early-phase images would yield data that could assist in both the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Therefore, previous studies have attempted to improve the diagnostic capability of dynamic images by adding imaging during the super-early phase to the standard protocol .

![Figure 1, The schema shows the process of dynamic imaging with the BT method in the present study. Before injecting contrast media, precontrast images were acquired as reference. According to the BT method, the trigger for starting the super-early phase was when the contrast media reached the aortic arch. The early phase, which followed the super-early phase, was started 1–2 minutes after the injection. The scanning of the diseased breast in the sagittal plane was followed by the delay phase at approximately 5 minutes after the injection.
