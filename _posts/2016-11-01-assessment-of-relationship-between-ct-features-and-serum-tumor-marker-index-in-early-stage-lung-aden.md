## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to assess the relationship between tumor marker index (TMI) and high-resolution computed tomography features in early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.

## Materials and Methods

Seventy-four stage IA lung adenocarcinomas confirmed pathologically were retrospectively evaluated. Lung nodules were divided into two types: solid nodule (SN) and subsolid nodule (SSN). The maximum diameters on mediastinal window in axial imaging (D  m ) and tumor shadow disappearance rate (TDR) were measured. Meanwhile, other computed tomography features of lung nodules were also recorded. TMI represents the geometric mean of normalized CEA and CYFRA 21-1 values, and the discriminatory value of TMI in this study was set at 1.0. The evaluation of discriminatory values for D  m and the TMI between SNs and SSNs was done with Mann-Whitney _U_ -test. The relationship between TDR and TMI in SSNs was evaluated by Pearson correlation analysis.

## Results

Of 74 cases, 40 cases (54.05%) showed SNs and 34 cases (45.95%) showed SSNs. D  m and TMI were higher in SNs than in SSNs (z = −4.782, _P_ < 0.001; z = −2.647, _P_ = 0.008). TDR demonstrated negative relationship with TMI in SSNs (r = −0.448, _P_ = 0.008). Spiculation (odds ratio \[OR\] = 14.685; 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 2.739–78.729; _P_ = 0.002), nodule type (OR = 6.215; 95% CI: 1.531–25.228; _P_ = 0.011), and gender (OR = 0.227; 95% CI: 0.062–0.833; _P_ = 0.025) were independent factors associated with TMI.

## Conclusions

Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma with lower TDR coexisting with spiculation was associated with higher TMI, especially in patients with solid nodule, which tended to have poor prognosis.

## Introduction

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) approximately accounts for 85% of lung cancer cases , which is one of the most prevalent and cancer-related death worldwide. For highly treatment refractory rate, considerable effort is currently devoted to NSCLC-related research area. However, early detection and surgical resection remain a primary way of improving the survival of NSCLC patients . Although pathologic stage IA (T1N0M0) NSCLC is able to be completely resected theoretically, postoperation survival rate is significantly variable (60–85%) in current clinical practice . In the quest to improve prognosis, reliable prognostic markers are required in order to select the best possible treatment for individual lung cancer patients who could benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for high-risk groups after operation. Thus, in addition to the tumor, node, and metastasis(TNM) stage, other factors with predictive value for prognosis, such as pathologic characteristics, imaging features, serum tumor markers, and molecular markers, are widely evaluated in clinical practice.

Pretreatment serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA21-1) are well-established serum tumor markers used for NSCLC, used as indicators of treatment response to improve the clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients. However, their evaluation when used in combination is often difficult. A prognostic score that is based on both tumor marker values—the tumor marker index (TMI)—was then introduced by Muley et al. . TMI is useful for predicting the prognosis of early-stage NSCLC patients and might help identify patients who are likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy .
