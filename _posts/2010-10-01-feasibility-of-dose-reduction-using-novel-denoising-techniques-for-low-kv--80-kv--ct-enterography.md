## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to optimize and validate projection-space denoising (PSDN) strategies for application to 80-kV computed tomographic (CT) data to achieve 50% dose reduction.

## Materials and Methods

Image data obtained at 80 kV (mean CT dose index volume, 7.9 mGy) from dual-source, dual-energy CT enterographic (CTE) exams in 42 patients were used. For each exam, nine 80 kV image data sets were reconstructed using PSDN (three levels of intensity) with or without image-based denoising and compared to commercial reconstruction kernels. For optimization, qualitative analysis selected optimal denoising strategies, with quantitative analysis measuring image contrast, noise, and sharpness (full width at half maximum bowel wall thickness, maximum CT number gradient). For validation, two radiologists examined image quality, comparing low-dose 80-kV optimally denoised images to full-dose mixed-voltage images.

## Results

PSDN algorithms generated the best 80-kV image quality (41 of 42 patients), while the commercial kernels produced the worst (39 of 42) ( _P_ < .001). Overall, 80-kV PSDN approaches resulted in higher contrast (mean, 332 vs 290 Hounsfield units), slightly less noise (mean, 20 vs 26 Hounsfield units), but slightly decreased image sharpness (relative bowel wall thickness, 1.069 vs 1.000) compared to full-dose mixed-voltage images. Mean image quality scores for full-dose CTE images were 4.9 compared to 4.5 for optimally denoised half-dose 80-kV CTE images and 3.1 for nondenoised 80-kV CTE images ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Optimized denoising strategies improve the quality of 80-kV CTE images such that CT data obtained at 50% of routine dose levels approaches the image quality of full-dose exams.

Rapid technical innovations in computed tomographic (CT) technology have caused a dramatic growth in the annual volume of CT scans, with CT imaging now delivering almost half of the estimated collective dose of radiation exposure in the United States . Public health concerns have consequently arisen because of the small theoretical risk for radiation-induced malignancies . Despite the controversies over the actual risk for widespread but low-level radiation used in medical imaging, radiologists must adhere to the principle of keeping doses as low as reasonably achievable.

There are several available methods to reduce CT radiation dose, including the optimized and individualized tailoring of the acquisition parameters (tube current–time product \[mAs\] and tube voltage) to minimize dose and maximize diagnostic information. Although reductions of both mAs and voltage produce decreases in radiation dose, low-voltage scanning has additional advantages. Because the signal of iodinated contrast material is higher at lower energies, low-voltage CT acquisition can also be used as a method to increase disease conspicuity . In our practice, we have seen dramatic potential for low-voltage scanning in performing dual-energy CT enterographic (CTE) examintations, because iodine signal is increased by a factor of 1.7 at 80 kV (as opposed to 120 kV). Increased iodine signal highlights segmental mural hyperenhancement, which is correlated with active inflammation on small bowel biopsy . Because Crohn's disease is the most common indication for CTE imaging, and because this disease affects young patients, who will possibly undergo multiple studies during symptomatic exacerbations throughout their lifetimes, radiation dose reduction in this group of patients would be particularly beneficial.

IQ was rated using a five-point scale (1 = nondiagnostic due to excessive noise or severe artifacts; 2 = severe artifacts or excessive noise, confidence degraded, diagnosis questionable; 3 = diagnostic, but excessive noise or moderate bowel wall blurriness; 4 = mild noise level or minimal bowel wall blurriness, no change in diagnostic confidence; and 5 = minimal noise with “crisp” bowel wall sharpness).
