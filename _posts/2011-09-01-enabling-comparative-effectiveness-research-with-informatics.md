## Rationale

Both outcomes researchers and informaticians are concerned with information and data. As such, some of the central challenges to conducting successful comparative effectiveness research can be addressed with informatics solutions.

## Methods

Specific informatics solutions which address how data in comparative effectiveness research are enriched, stored, shared, and analyzed are reviewed.

## Results

Imaging data can be made more quantitative, uniform, and structured for researchers through the use of lexicons and structured reporting. Secure and scalable storage of research data is enabled through data warehouses and cloud services. There are a number of national efforts to help researchers share research data and analysis tools.

## Conclusion

There is a diverse arsenal of informatics tools designed to meet the needs of comparative effective researchers.

Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has become an important priority for imaging and outcomes researchers. A focus on the comparison of existing diagnostic and therapeutic interventions will enable improvement of outcomes while making the best use of increasingly limited resources. However, it is the potentially unique characteristics of comparative effectiveness research that can make it even more challenging than typical research paradigms, such as placebo-controlled clinical trials. How can an investigator reconcile the idea that CER should be applicable to “real-world settings” when comparing interventions with the fact that the clinical and outcomes information found in existing clinical systems are seldom coded, stored, identified, or accessed in ways that are suited or designed for research? How can researcher share such data with others? What are the best ways to analyze such information? Although the success of CER hinges on an investigator’s ability to make the best use of information and knowledge, the success of informatics as a field depends on its ability to identify and address the most worthwhile challenges, such as the ones facing the community of comparative effectiveness researchers. Some of the central challenges to conducting successful CER can be addressed with informatics solutions.

In its most general sense, the field of informatics deals with the management of information and knowledge. The various methods of performing comparative effectiveness research all rely on the ability to marshal key pieces of information from individuals, aggregate them, and harvest generalizable knowledge from that information. Research informatics has long had an impact on the practice of clinical trials and observational studies, but comparative effectiveness researchers face new challenges as analyses of national registries, claims data, and even clinical information play more important roles as sources of evidence. In this setting, the researcher who is prepared to harness the power of the best clinical and research informatics tools can quickly develop an arsenal ideally suited for CER.
