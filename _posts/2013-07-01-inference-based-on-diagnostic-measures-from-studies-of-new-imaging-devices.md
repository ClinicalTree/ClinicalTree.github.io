## Rationale and Objectives

Before using a new diagnostic imaging device regularly in a clinic, it should be studied using patients and radiologists. Often such studies report diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), or differences thereof. In this report we look at how these studies differ from actual future clinical practice and how those differences may affect reported performance measures.

## Materials and Methods

We review signal detection (receiver operating characteristic) theory and decision theory. We compare diagnostic measures from several published studies in medical imaging and examine how they relate to theory and each other.

## Results

We see that clinical decisions can be modeled using signal detection and decision theories. Sensitivity and specificity are inextricably linked with clinical factors, such as prevalence and costs. Imaging devices are used in many different ways in clinical practice, so that sensitivities, specificities, and AUCs measured in studies of new diagnostic imaging devices will differ from those in actual future clinical use.

## Conclusions

Measured sensitivities, specificities, and the directions of changes thereof are not necessarily consistent or reproducible across studies of new diagnostic devices. A change in the AUC, which should be independent of clinical costs or prevalence, is a consistent measure across similar studies, and a positive change in AUC is indicative of additional diagnostic information that will be available to radiologists in a future clinical environment.

New diagnostic imaging devices are typically tested by means of one or more performance studies before they are regularly used in a clinical environment. The kind of study performed may vary from device to device, but if the device is substantially different from other devices previously used in the clinic, then we should perform a study that demonstrates the clinical efficacy of the device. As stated by Fryback and Thornbury , “Diagnostic accuracy efficacy is not simply a function of the image. It is a joint function of the images and of an observer, such as a radiologist.” Therefore, these studies should measure the ability of radiologists to use the device to differentiate actual patients who have a condition or disease from those who do not. This study may have only one arm where the radiologists use only the new device to determine disease or condition. This study may have two arms and compare the diagnostic performance of the radiologists when using standard diagnostics against their performance when using the new imaging device in addition to or instead of the standard diagnostics. In both study arms, we can collect ratings from the radiologists that indicate their confidence in the presence of disease for each patient. We may also have the radiologists recommend a course of action for each patient given the diagnostic data.

As with all studies, we would like to infer as much as possible, in particular how the device will be used when making actual clinical decisions. We would like to know at what sensitivity, specificity, or recall rate it will be used for different possible courses of action in future clinical patient management. We could assume that the sensitivity or specificity measured in the study will be the same as that in future clinical practice. However, as we will see, theory and experience tell us that this is not a correct assumption. We cannot expect that sensitivities, specificities, or differences thereof as measured in studies of new devices will be consistent with future clinical practice, or even consistent between the studies themselves. Because clinical utility depends on sensitivity and specificity, we should not expect that we can estimate the clinical utility of the new device given the results of the study. Unfortunately, making predictions, particularly about the use of diagnostics in future medical practice, is difficult.

![Figure 1, The solid curve is an example receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. It relates the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic decision maker. The dotted line is the expected utility as given in Equation 2 , which is a function of the true- and false-positive fraction (TPF and FPF, respectively). It is plotted on an arbitrary vertical scale for one particular set of costs and benefits. A decision maker, such as a radiologist, sets her FPF and TPF such that they maximize her perceived utility, such as the one at the dashed vertical line. The location of this maximum will depend on costs, benefits and disease prevalence. This plot is similar to those in Wagner et al (16) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/InferenceBasedonDiagnosticMeasuresfromStudiesofNewImagingDevices/0_1s20S1076633213001116.jpg)

where π is the prevalence of the disease in the population, and the _U_ values are utilities for each kind of decision (ie, benefits and costs expressed in commensurate units). Because FNF = 1 − TPF and TNF = 1 − FPF, the second and third terms of Equation  1 are often combined, and the fourth and fifth terms are combined, and a simplified version of the equation is sometimes used:

The total average utility (benefit minus cost) is U¯¯¯

. _C__0_ is the overhead cost, including the average cost of performing the diagnostic test on a patient. _B__D_ is the relative benefit of identifying a diseased patient as diseased rather than nondiseased. _C__N_ is the relative cost of misidentifying nondiseased patients as diseased rather than nondiseased, which would include the cost of overtreatment. For a successful diagnostic program, the total average utility should be positive if all costs and benefits are positive and taken into account.

The circles indicate the TPF and FPF of each of 10 individual radiologists when recommending biopsy for 150 patients. The diamonds indicate the TPFs and FPFs of the same radiologists when recommending any kind of immediate work-up for the same patients and images. The identification number of each physician is inside the plotting symbol. The wide line is the best-fitting binormal ROC curve to the data.

NA indicates no previous mammograms. These data were collected by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (41) from 1996 to 2006. Each data point is the average of several hundred thousand noncancer screening mammography examinations and several thousand examinations of cancers performed by several hundred radiologists. The statistical error bars on these data points are smaller than the plotted characters due to the large size of the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium database.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/InferenceBasedonDiagnosticMeasuresfromStudiesofNewImagingDevices/2_1s20S1076633213001116.jpg)
