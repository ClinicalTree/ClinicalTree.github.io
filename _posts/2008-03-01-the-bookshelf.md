Mosby Elsevier’s classic reference textbook Taybi and Lachman’s Radiology of Syndromes, Metabolic Disorders and Skeletal Dysplasias, 5th edition, has undergone impressive renovation over the years. I cannot really imagine how much work went into making such an impressive and apparently exhaustive reference book. I was interested to read in the author’s comments that the original (1st ed) was released in 1975. It is a rare radiology book that can persevere across the decades and remain a staple. This one has.

The current edition’s organization is very well thought out and, despite the myriad of diseases that you could find in here, there is a very handy “gamut” section that can assist you through differential diagnosis—using ready references to the specific diseases within the text. This text is extensively referenced and usually keeps the specific disease passages to a manageable length (both assets). One of the aspects that I particularly liked was a listing of the OMIM number where applicable (then you can look up even more information on the Internet if you are so inclined). Of course, this book is not well-suited to just sitting down and reading through it. That being said, I cannot imagine a good radiology library (personal or shared) not having one!

One recurring disappointment that I had in reviewing this text is that many of the figures and images are of varying and frequently poor quality. Many scanned (from printed film) images are used; this is definitely an area in which the book could be markedly improved. I am sure that finding current high-resolution images from these diseases would be a significant challenge, but I have no doubt that this is a drawback that could be rectified (perhaps by the 6th ed?). Perhaps readers of this classic text would be glad to help update the images? I’d like to think so.

In summary, this text is the very definition of “old school,” but has gotten a fantastic renovation. This is a classic and a “don’t miss” if you are considering adding to your library. Who knows … you may even see one of these disorders today while reading. You never know!
