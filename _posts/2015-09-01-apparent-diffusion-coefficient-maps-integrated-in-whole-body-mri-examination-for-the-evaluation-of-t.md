## Rationale and objectives

To determine the diagnostic value of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in the assessment of response to chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

## Materials and methods

Fourteen patients (seven women) with MM underwent whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) study on a 1.5T scanner, before and after chemotherapy. DWI with background body signal suppression (DWIBS) sequences ( _b_ values: 0, 500, and 1000 mm  2 /sec) were qualitatively analyzed, along with T1 turbo spine echo and short tau inversion recovery T2-weighted images, to evaluate bone lesions. On ADC maps, regions of interest were manually drawn along contours of lesions. The ADC values percentage variation (ΔADC) before (MR1) and after (MR2) chemotherapy were calculated and compared between responders (11 of 14) and nonresponders (3 of 14). The percentage of plasma cells by the means of the bone marrow aspirate was evaluated as parameter for response to chemotherapy.

## Results

Twenty-four lesions, hyperintense on DWIBS as compared to normal bone marrow, were evaluated. In responder group, the mean ADC values were 0.63 ± 0.24 × 10  -3 mm  2 /s on MR1 and 1.04 ± 0.46 × 10  -3 mm  2 /s on MR2; partial or complete signal intensity decrease during follow-up on DWIBS was found along with a reduction of plasma cells infiltration in the bone marrow. The mean ADC values for nonresponders were 0.61 ± 0.05 × 10  -3 mm  2 /s on MR1 and 0.69 ± 0.09 × 10  -3 mm  2 /s on MR2. The mean variation of ΔADC in responders (Δ = 66%) was significantly different ( _P_ < .05) than in nonresponders (Δ = 15%).

## Conclusions

WB-MRI with DWIBS sequences, by evaluating posttreatment changes of ADC values, might represent a complementary diagnostic tool in the assessment of response to chemotherapy in MM patients.

In the past decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown a high diagnostic and prognostic value in monoclonal plasma cell disorders . It has also been included as additional imaging tool for diagnosis and staging protocols of multiple myeloma (MM) , but, to date, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine MRI after treatment because most of the findings are not specific .

In MM follow-up, the role of imaging is still limited, relying on skeletal survey although bone marrow aspirate and laboratory parameters (serum and urinary M-protein measurements) are the mainstay of the evaluation of response to chemotherapy. According to the most recent guidelines, plain films should be repeated after clinical or laboratory evidence of disease progression , but on conventional radiographs, lytic bone lesions rarely demonstrate signs of healing. Moreover, the evidence of new vertebral compressions may not indicate disease progression, occurring even after an effective therapy . Therefore, an accurate imaging technique able to detect treatment-related changes could increase the ability to monitor MM patients, even those with reduced or absent M-protein secretion.
