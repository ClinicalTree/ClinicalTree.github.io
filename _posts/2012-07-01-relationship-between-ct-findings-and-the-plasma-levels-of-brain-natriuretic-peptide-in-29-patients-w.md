## Rationale and Objectives

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a useful biomarker for the assessment of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. This study evaluated the relationship between computed tomography (CT) findings and plasma BNP levels in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine consecutive outpatients with severe respiratory failure from cardiogenic edema presenting to emergency departments were enrolled. They underwent chest CT and plasma BNP levels were measured in the emergency room. CT findings were independently evaluated by two radiologists who were unaware of the patients’ clinical information.

## Results

The plasma BNP levels only correlated with the volume of pleural effusion in each side (right: _r  s_ = 0.519, _P_ = .004; left: _r  s_ = 0.460, _P_ = .012). No significant correlation was observed between the BNP levels and the findings of lung parenchyma or cardiovascular enlargement.

## Conclusion

Estimating the pleural effusion volume with CT may be a feasible method as well as measuring the plasma BNP level in the assessment of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

The plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a sensitive diagnostic marker of dyspnea from cardiac causes , and a prognostic marker after an episode of acute coronary syndrome and in patients with chronic heart failure .

Computed tomography (CT) is increasingly used in emergency departments and is thought to have advantages in the diagnosis of patients with severe acute respiratory failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and pulmonary embolism . However, the correlation between plasma BNP levels and radiological findings has not been fully evaluated in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, except in patients with a mild pulmonary embolism . This study, therefore, compared chest CT findings with the plasma BNP levels, to determine whether chest CT was a useful auxiliary tool in the assessment of acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
