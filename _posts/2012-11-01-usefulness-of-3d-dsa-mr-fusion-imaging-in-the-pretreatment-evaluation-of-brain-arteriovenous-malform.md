## Rationale and Objectives

For the evaluation of patients scheduled for the treatment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), accurate anatomical information is essential. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of three-dimensional (3D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-magnetic resonance (MR) fusion imaging for the pretreatment evaluation of AVMs.

## Materials and Methods

The study population consisted of 11 consecutive patients (7 males, 4 females; age 10–72 years; mean 45 years) with brain AVMs. All prospectively underwent pretreatment MR imaging (MRI), MR angiography (MRA), and two-dimensional (2D) and 3D DSA. The 3D DSA and MR images were semiautomatically fused with fusion software on a workstation. In the delineation of AVM nidus, feeder, drainer, and relationship between AVM and the adjacent brain structures, two radiologists independently evaluated MRA and MRI, three-dimensional (3D) DSA, and MRI, and 3D DSA-MR fusion images using a 4-point scoring system. The referring neurosurgeons were asked whether the information provided by 3D DSA-MR fusion images was helpful for treatment decisions.

## Results

For all four items, the delineation was significantly better with the 3D DSA/MRI or 3D DSA-MR fusion images than the MRA/MRI images. Although the delineation for the nidus, feeder, and drainer were not significantly different between the 3D DSA/MRI and 3D DSA-MR fusion images, 3D DSA-MR fusion imaging were significantly better for the relationship between AVM and the adjacent brain structures than 3D DSA/MR imaging ( _P_ = .0047). The information provided by 3D DSA-MR fusion images was helpful for treatment decisions in all cases.

## Conclusion

3D DSA-MR fusion images are useful for the pretreatment evaluation of brain AVMs.

At the pretreatment assessment of brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the precise relationship between the nidus, feeders, and drainers and the adjacent hematoma and/or brain structures must be recognized. Intra-arterial two-dimensional (2D) digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the standard reference procedure for the diagnosis and follow-up of brain AVMs because of its high temporal and spatial resolution . However, it does not provide three-dimensional (3D) information on the vasculature and adjacent brain tissues. On conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR angiography (MRA), including source and multiplanar reconstruction images, the intracranial vasculature and brain tissues are visualized; therefore, these techniques are valuable for the pretreatment and follow-up evaluation of brain AVMs .

Image fusion techniques consisting of the registration of different kinds of images are widely used for diagnostic purposes and pretreatment planning . The fusion of 3D DSA and MR images yields useful information on the vasculature (eg, perforating arteries, aneurysms) and brain tissues . Although it is expected to be useful for the evaluation of brain AVMs, the report regarding the utility of 3D DSA-MR fusion imaging in patients with brain AVMs is limited . The usefulness of this technique for the pretreatment evaluation of brain AVMs has not been systematically investigated. The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the usefulness of 3D DSA-MR fusion imaging in conjunction with 2D DSA for the pretreatment evaluation of brain AVMs.

The MRA source image (c) does not clearly depict any abnormal vessel structures.

Axial (f) and sagittal (g) 3D DSA-MR fusion images reveal a small nidus ( arrow ) inferomedial to the hematoma. For the AVM nidus, feeder, and drainer, the two observers classified as sufficient visualization (grade 2) on the combination of 3D DSA and MRI (3D DSA/MRI) and 3D DSA-MR fusion images. In the spatial relationship to the brain and hematoma, they scaled as ambiguous visualization (grade 1) for 3D DSA/MRI and as sufficient visualization (grade 2) for 3D DSA-MR fusion images. According to this finding, neurosurgeons made a decision to remove the hematoma first and then the adjacent feeders and nidus during surgery.

![Figure 4, An 11-year-old boy (case 10) with a left parieto-occipital brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and hemorrhage. The fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image (a) shows a hypointense hematoma ( arrowhead ) with a flow-void lesion corresponding to the AVM nidus ( arrow ). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (b) depicts the AVM lesion ( arrow ) in the left parieto-occipital region. The MRA source image (c) shows hyperintense vessel structures in the nidus ( arrow ) and surrounding hematoma. For the AVM nidus, feeder, drainer, and the relationship to the brain and hematoma on MRA/MR imaging, the two observers scaled as grade 1. Anteroposterior views of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (d,e) and three-dimensional (3D) DSA (f,g) from the left internal carotid and vertebral arteries show an AVM nidus fed by the left middle and the posterior cerebral artery, respectively. The anterior cerebral artery feeds the nidus slightly. The 3D DSA-MR image fused with 3D DSA from the left internal carotid artery (h) reveals two feeders ( arrows ) and the posterolateral part of the nidus adjacent to the hematoma. The 3D DSA-MR image fused with 3D DSA from the left vertebral artery (i) shows the feeders ( arrow ) and the anteromedial part of the nidus. Compared with MRI/MRA and 3D DSA/MRI, the 3D DSA-MR fusion images provided more precise information about the spatial relationship between the nidus and the feeders from each pedicle. The two observers classified the 3D DSA-MR fusion images as grade 2. This information was highly helpful for the early localization and management of the feeding arteries during surgery (grade 2).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/Usefulnessof3DDSAMRFusionImaginginthePretreatmentEvaluationofBrainArteriovenousMalformations/3_1s20S1076633212003789.jpg)
