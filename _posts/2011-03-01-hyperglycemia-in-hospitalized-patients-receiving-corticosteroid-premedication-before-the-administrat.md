## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the effect of short-term corticosteroid premedication on serum glucose in hospitalized patients.

## Materials and Methods

Serum glucose in adult inpatients receiving corticosteroid premedication before a radiology study was compared to serum glucose in nonpremedicated controls between May 1, 2008, and September 12, 2009. Patients were categorized by type of nonionic contrast medium (intravenous \[IV\] or none) and route of corticosteroid premedication (oral, IV, none). Diabetes mellitus (types I and II) was evaluated as an independent risk factor. Patients without glucose estimations before and after premedication were excluded. Results were analyzed with analysis of variance and a stepwise linear regression analysis.

## Results

There were 390 corticosteroid premedication episodes in 390 patients; 873 examinations in 844 patients served as controls. Cohorts receiving corticosteroid premedication experienced a brief (24–48 hour) increase in mean maximum postbaseline serum glucose (IV, +81 mg/dL; oral, +70 mg/dL) that was greater than the increase in nonpremedicated controls (+46 mg/dL). Type I (+144 mg/dL) and type II (+108 mg/dL) diabetics had a greater elevation than nondiabetics (+34 mg/dL). Both corticosteroid premedication (IV, _P_ = .02; oral, _P_ = .01) and diabetes mellitus (type I, _P_ = .0002; type II, _P_ < .0001) were significant independent risk factors of hyperglycemia. The use of nonionic intravascular contrast medium was not ( _P_ = .7). There was no significant difference between IV and oral premedication ( _P_ = .6), or type I and type II diabetes mellitus ( _P_ = .8).

## Conclusions

Diabetes mellitus (type I and type II) and corticosteroid premedication (oral and IV) are significant independent risk factors for the development of brief hyperglycemia near the time of inpatient radiology studies.

The American College of Radiology recommends that corticosteroid premedication be administered before intravascular contrast medium injection in patients at increased risk for an allergic-like reaction . This is done to reduce the likelihood of a severe allergic-like reaction, although no trials have demonstrated a conclusive risk reduction for severe reactions . The risks of corticosteroids are presumed to be lower than the risks of a potential reaction, but this favorable risk–benefit relationship has been assumed rather than rigorously validated. For example, corticosteroids are known to cause hyperglycemia , and hyperglycemia secondary to a variety of causes has been shown to confer an increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients . Diabetic patients are at greatest risk for the development of hyperglycemia from their impaired ability to use glucose. There is a paucity of published data analyzing the risks of corticosteroid premedication for imaging studies, particularly in the at-risk diabetic population. The purpose of our study was to assess the effect of short-term corticosteroid premedication on serum glucose levels in hospitalized patients.

## Subjects and methods

Before the initiation of this investigation, institutional review board approval was obtained. The study was carried out in compliance with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Patient informed consent was not required based on institutional policy and the retrospective nature of this investigation.
