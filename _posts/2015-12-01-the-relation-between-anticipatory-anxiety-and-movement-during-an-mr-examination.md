## Rationale and Objectives

During a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, patients are required to remain still to minimize motion that may compromise image quality and may make rescanning necessary. It is often assumed that anxiety, which is experienced by a considerable number of patients undergoing an MR examination, increases motion and decreases image quality. The present study explores the relationship between anxiety and movement of patients during an MR examination.

## Materials and Methods

Anxiety was measured subjectively by means of the State Anxiety Inventory and a visual analogue scale for claustrophobia. Motion and image quality were measured in three different ways. First, software was used that allows an estimation of motion based on tracker scans between the clinical scans. Second, the MRI technician who performed the MR examination was asked to indicate the degree of motion artifacts and image quality for each patient. Third, after all scans had been collected, two radiologists evaluated each clinical scan.

## Results

No or low correlations between anxiety and the distinct measures of motion and image quality were found for all three measures.

## Conclusions

This finding shows that there is little evidence for the assumption that anxiety increases motion and decreases image quality during an MR examination.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important and widely used diagnostic tool in clinical practice. Unfortunately, MR examinations are associated with anxiety reactions in many patients. Studies have consistently shown that more than one third of patients undergoing an MR examination experience anxiety and that approximately 15% of patients require sedation to be able to tolerate the examination . Besides concerns about the diagnosis, causes of anxiety include the length of the procedure and the loud noise of the scanner . In addition, anxiety may be because of the narrowness of the bore and associated movement restrictions . Having to remain still is often reported as the most unpleasant aspect of an MR examination .

Remaining still during an MR examination is necessary because body movement can reduce image quality and may consequently decrease diagnostic utility. In addition, degraded image quality may make it necessary to repeat a scan which increases examination time and consumes expensive resources. It has been reported that motion artifacts that impair diagnostic quality occur in up to 7% of all MR examinations .
