## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess copper metabolism of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging using copper (II)-64 chloride (  64 CuCl  2 ) as a tracer.

## Materials and Methods

PET imaging of athymic mice ( _n_ = 5) bearing extrahepatic HCC xenografts was performed 24 hours after the intravenous injection of  64 CuCl  2 , followed by ex vivo tissue radioactivity assay. Expression of human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1) in HCC cells and tissues was examined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively.

## Results

The extrahepatic HCC xenografts in mice with increased uptake of  64 Cu radionuclide were visualized on the micro-PET images obtained 24 hours after the intravenous injection of  64 CuCl  2 . PET quantitative analysis revealed increased  64 Cu radioactivity in tumor tissues (2.7 ± 0.6 %ID/g) compared to that in the soft tissue of the left shoulder opposite to the tumor site (0.6 ± 0.2 %ID/g) and the brain (0.7 ± 0.1 %ID/g) but lower than that of the liver (16.6 ± 1.3 %ID/g). Expression of hCTR1 in the HCC cells and xenograft tumor tissues was demonstrated by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively. The expression level of hCTR1 in the Hep3B HCC xenograft tissues was lower than that detected in the normal hepatic tissues and the tissue samples of well-differentiated primary HCC. Variable expression of hCTR1 was detected in the tissue samples of moderately differentiated primary HCC.

## Conclusions

Extrahepatic human HCC xenografts in mice could be localized with  64 CuCl  2 PET imaging, which might be useful for the localization and quantitative assessment of copper metabolism in extrahepatic metastases of HCC in humans.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a threat to the health of the global population, particularly to people living in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa . Significant advances have been made in the treatment of patients diagnosed with the early stages of HCC, but the prognosis for patients with extrahepatic HCC metastases is poor, because they are often resistant to systemic chemotherapy . Moreover, the prognosis of patients with intracranial metastases of HCC is dismal . Liver transplantation is a potentially curative treatment for those patients with HCC localized within the liver . In the pretransplantation workup, however, it is essential to exclude extrahepatic metastases in those patients who are considered candidates for liver transplantation. Positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging using 2-deoxy-2-\[  18 F\]-fluoro-  d -glucose (  18 F-FDG) is clinically well accepted for the staging of many human cancers and has been found to be highly sensitive for the detection of the extrahepatic spread of hypermetabolic HCC . However,  18 F-FDG PET imaging is limited for the detection of intracranial HCC metastases because of the high background of FDG uptake by the normal brain tissue. Thus, it is necessary to establish an alternative tracer that may be used for the evaluation of intracranial metastases of HCC under circumstances in which the use of  18 F FDG PET imaging is limited.

Copper is an essential nutrient in mammals, and intracellular copper homeostasis in humans is regulated by a delicate network of copper transporters , which include human copper transporter 1 (hCTR1), ATP7A, ATP7B, as well as copper chaperons antioxidant protein 1, cytochrome c oxidase 17, and copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase . Copper is required for cell proliferation and tumor growth, and high concentrations of copper have been observed in many of human tumor tissues . Extrahepatic mouse hepatoma grafts and human prostate xenografts in mice could be localized with PET imaging using  64 CuCl  2 as a tracer . In this study, PET imaging of athymic mice bearing human HCC xenografts was conducted to determine whether extrahepatic human HCC metastases could be localized with  64 CuCl  2 PET imaging. To study the molecular mechanism of copper hypermetabolism in HCC, expression of hCTR1 in HCC cells and tumor tissues was examined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RC-PCR) and immunohistochemistry analysis, respectively.
