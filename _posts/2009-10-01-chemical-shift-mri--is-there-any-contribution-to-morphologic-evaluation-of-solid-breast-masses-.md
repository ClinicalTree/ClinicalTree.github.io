## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the contribution of chemical shift magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of the margins of solid breast masses by benefiting from India ink artifact.

## Methods and Materials

Eighty-eight masses in 64 patients were evaluated in T1- and T2-weighted images, dynamic contrast and chemical shift studies according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System magnetic resonance lexicon. Subtraction images were automatically obtained by chemical shift imaging and dynamic studies. Each sequence was scored using a scale of 1 to 5 according to its ability to demonstrate margins separate from surrounding parenchyma. Breast parenchyma was evaluated as fatty and dense. The results were compared with the histopathologic results.

## Results

Twenty-eight (31.8%) of the lesions were localized in fatty breast, and the remaining 60 (68.2%) lesions were localized in dense breast. There were 34 (38.6%) benign and 54 (61.4%) malignant masses. In fatty breast, chemical shift subtraction and T1-weighted images were valuable both for the demonstration and differentiation of benign lesions ( _P_ < .05). None of the sequence was valuable for both the demonstration and differentiation of malignant lesions in fatty breasts ( _P_ \> .05). In dense breasts, chemical shift subtraction and dynamic contrast subtraction images were valuable for both the demonstration and differentiation of benign and malignant lesions. Additional to these sequences, T2-weighted images was also valuable for benign lesions ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

Chemical shift subtraction can contribute to routine dynamic contrast subtraction in morphologic analysis particularly for the evaluation of margins of benign lesions in fatty breasts. It can also help in morphologic analysis of masses in dense breast.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important modality in the breast imaging practice. MRI has a higher sensitivity of detection of breast cancer than mammography and ultrasonography (US) . But approximately, 8%–10% of invasive breast cancers cannot be detected. Along with the technical factors, varying degrees of contrast enhancement of different lesions and excessive enhancement of glandular tissue may be the causes of missed cancers . Both morphologic and enhancement characteristics are used for the evaluation of the lesions . Subtraction method is used for better evaluation of morphology and enhancement characteristics of the lesions.

Chemical-shift MRI is based on the fact that hydrogen atoms of water and fat molecules have different precession frequencies . Chemical shift subtraction (CSS) technique is obtained by subtracting in-phase images from out-phase images. CSS, which gives information about the fat content of the lesion and surrounding structures, has been successfully used in the differentiation of fat-containing adenomas of adrenal gland . Chemical shift imaging includes two types of margin artifacts: chemical shift artifact and India ink artifact. Chemical shift artifact, also known as misregistration artifact, occurs as a result of misregistration of signal across the frequency-encoding direction because of signals failing to part from desired spatial frequency encoding due to different resonance frequencies in water and fat. India ink artifact is seen due to water and fat protons existing in the same voxel. In voxels localized in close proximity to water-fat interfaces, water and fat protons exist at similar ratios, and because those spins exhibit a 180° opposed direction in out-phase, signal loss occurs (phase cancellation). In out-phase image, interface areas appear black as if drawn by India ink because of signal loss. This is known as India ink artifact, or fat water artifact or black lining artifact . Because of the India ink artifact, the margin of a mass containing no fat appears as black at the mass-surrounding fat interface on out-phase image (  Fig. 1 ). On the subtraction image obtained from subtraction of out-phase image from in-phase image, mass is seen as black and margin is seen bright making it more obvious from surrounding structures (  Fig. 1 ).
