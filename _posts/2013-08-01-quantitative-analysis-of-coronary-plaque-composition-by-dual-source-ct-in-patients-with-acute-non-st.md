## Rationale and Objectives

To quantitatively assess coronary atherosclerotic plaque composition in patients with acute non–ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) by coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) correlated with virtual histology intravascular ultrasound (VH-IVUS).

## Materials and Methods

Sixty patients (35 with NSTEMI) were included. Corresponding plaques were assessed by dual-source cCTA and VH-IVUS regarding volumes and percentages of fatty, fibrous, and calcified component; overall plaque burden; and maximal percent area stenosis. Possible differences between patient groups were investigated. Concordance between cCTA and VH-IVUS measurements was validated by Bland–Altman analysis.

## Results

Forty corresponding plaques (22 of patients with NSTEMI) were finally analyzed by cCTA and VH-IVUS. cCTA plaque analysis revealed no significant differences between plaques of patients with NSTEMI and stable CAD regarding absolute and relative amounts of any plaque component (fatty: 20 mm³/13% versus 17 mm³/14%; fibrous: 81 mm³/63% versus 80 mm³/53%; calcified: 16 mm³/14% versus 26 mm³/26%; all _P_ \> .05) or overall plaque burden (153 mm³ versus 165 mm³; _P_ \> .05), nor did VH-IVUS plaque analysis. VH-IVUS measured a higher area stenosis in patients with NSTEMI compared to patients with stable CAD (76% versus 68%, _P_ = .01; in cCTA 69% versus 65%, _P_ = .2). Volumes of fatty component were measured systematically lower in cCTA, whereas calcified and fibrous volumes were higher. No significant bias was observed comparing volumes of overall noncalcified component and overall plaque burden.

## Conclusion

Plaques of patients with acute NSTEMI and of patients with stable CAD cannot be differentiated by quantification of plaque components. cCTA and VH-IVUS differ in plaque component analysis.

Coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has been proved to reliably exclude presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) and is increasingly used to assess CAD and further characterize atherosclerotic lesions as well . Histopathology studies have assessed characteristics of stable and instable plaques . The likeliness of a plaque to rupture—its vulnerability—and to subsequently cause vessel obstruction and myocardial infarction is known to be largely dependent on its composition, and strong efforts are made to reliably risk-stratify plaques and patients. The invasive reference standard for plaque composition imaging is intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) . The search for accurate noninvasive plaque imaging modalities is ongoing. With further improvement of temporal and spatial resolution, cCTA continues to emerge as a promising technique in the quest for a noninvasive plaque imaging reference standard .

Plaque analysis with cCTA was previously evaluated in mostly select plaque and patient samples concerning, for example, proximal lesion localization, nonobstructive CAD, absence of arrhythmias, or low Agatston score with the goal of achieving optimal CT image quality . The parameters most frequently studied were stenosis grading, overall plaque burden, and classification into calcified and noncalcified plaques and plaque components. Data about the performance of cCTA with regard to further differentiation and quantification of plaque components in correlation to virtual histology IVUS (VH-IVUS) are limited. To our knowledge, Brodoefel et al were the first to differentiate and quantitatively assess fatty, fibrous, and calcified components using dual-source CT in plaques of patients with stable CAD .
