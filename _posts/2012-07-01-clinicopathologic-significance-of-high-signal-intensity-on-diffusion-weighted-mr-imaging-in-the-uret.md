## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the clinicopathologic significance of high-intensity areas in the ureter, urethra, prostate, and bone incidentally found on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) for the staging of bladder cancer.

## Materials and Methods

Axial and sagittal DWI and T2-weighted imaging of the pelvis were evaluated in 157 patients with bladder cancer. Two observers assessed T2-weighted imaging with DWI independently. The observers pointed out 67 areas showing abnormal high signal intensity on DWI in the ureter ( _n_ = 17), urethra ( _n_ = 8), prostate ( _n_ = 20), and bone ( _n_ = 22). Of the 67 high-intensity areas, 33 lesions were confirmed histopathologically (ureter, _n_ = 10; urethra, _n_ = 7; prostate, _n_ = 16), and 22 bone lesions were diagnosed using T1-weighted imaging and follow-up computed tomography. Thus, 55 lesions were evaluable for correlation with DWI findings.

## Results

Of the 55 high-intensity areas, 28 (53%) were synchronous or metastatic urothelial cancer or invasion of urothelial cancer. The remaining 27 (47%) were a ureteral clot in one, a ureteral stone granuloma in one, prostatic cancer in six, granulomatous prostatitis in three, and normal red bone marrow in 16.

## Conclusions

DWI is useful to comprehend the extent of bladder cancer and to detect incidentally coexisting diseases. Other imaging, endoscopic, and clinical findings would be useful to reduce false positivity.

In recent years, the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect various cancers, including those of the liver, breast, prostate, uterus, colorectum, and bone, has been reported . The usefulness of DWI to detect bladder cancer and determine the tumor stage has also been reported; the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of bladder cancer is low, and cancer shows high signal intensity (SI) on DWI . When interpreting pelvic DWI to determine the tumor stage of bladder cancer, abnormal high intensity is often found outside the bladder (eg, in the prostate, ureter, urethra, and bone). DWI high intensity may represent invasion or metastasis of bladder cancer, but it has not yet been clarified whether other malignant or nonmalignant lesions can also show such high intensity. Because the strategy for treating bladder cancer changes with the tumor site, extent, and stage, clarifying the clinical significance of such high-intensity areas would be very important. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinicopathologic significance of high-intensity areas in the prostate, ureter, urethra, or bone incidentally found on pelvic DWI performed for the purpose of staging bladder cancer.

## Materials and methods

## Patient Population

The subjects of this study were 157 patients with bladder cancer undergoing pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the tumor stage and repeat computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis to evaluate the node and metastasis stages between August 2006 and September 2009. All pelvic MRI studies included T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and DWI. All patients underwent pelvic CT both at initial diagnosis and 3 to 9 months later. There were 118 men and 39 women aged 38 to 91 years (mean age, 71 years). Two abdominal radiologists reviewed 157 MRI studies and identified 67 areas that showed abnormally high SI in the ureter, urethra, prostate, or bone on DWI in 56 patients, on the basis of criteria described later. Of the patients, 29 underwent surgical intervention for areas showing high SI on DWI, including one-sided nephroureterectomy in nine, cystoprostatectomy in nine, prostatic biopsy in eight, ureteral biopsy in one, and urethral biopsy in two. From these surgical specimens, 33 high-intensity areas on DWI were histopathologically evaluable. One radiologist interpreted T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and both computed tomographic images to diagnose 22 bony lesions on the basis of criteria described later. Finally, 55 areas in 45 patients (36 men, nine women; age range, 38–91 years; mean age, 71 years) were evaluable for correlation with DWI findings. The local institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement for patient informed consent was waived.
