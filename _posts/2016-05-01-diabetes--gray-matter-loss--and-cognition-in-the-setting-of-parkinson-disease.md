## Rationale and Objectives

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting motor and cognitive functions. Prior studies showed that patients with PD and diabetes (DM) demonstrate worse clinical outcomes compared to nondiabetic subjects with PD. Our study aimed at defining the relationship between DM, gray matter volume, and cognition in patients with PD.

## Materials and Methods

This study included 36 subjects with PD (12 with DM, 24 without DM, mean age = 66). Subjects underwent high-resolution T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging, \[  11 C\]dihydrotetrabenazine positron emission tomography imaging to quantify nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation, clinical, and cognitive assessments. Magnetic resonance images were postprocessed to determine total and lobar cortical gray matter volumes. Cognitive testing scores were converted to z-scores for specific cognitive domains and a composite global cognitive z-score based on normative data computed. Analysis of covariance, accounting for effects of age, gender, intracranial volume, and striatal \[  11 C\]dihydrotetrabenazine binding, was used to test the relationship between DM and gray matter volumes.

## Results

Impact of DM on total gray matter volume was significant ( _P_ = 0.02). Post hoc analyses of lobar cortical gray matter volumes revealed that DM was more selectively associated with lower gray matter volumes in the frontal regions ( _P_ = 0.01). Cognitive post hoc analyses showed that interaction of total gray matter volume and DM status was significantly associated with composite ( _P_ = 0.007), executive ( _P_ = 0.02), and visuospatial domain cognitive z-scores ( _P_ = 0.005). These associations were also significant for the frontal cortical gray matter.

## Conclusion

DM may exacerbate brain atrophy and cognitive functions in PD with greater vulnerability in the frontal lobes. Given the high prevalence of DM in the elderly, delineating its effects on patient outcomes in the PD population is of importance.

## Introduction

Numerous epidemiologic studies show increased risk of dementia in diabetic subjects compared to nondiabetic individuals. A recent meta-analysis of 16 prior studies (5706 people with diabetes \[DM\] and 36,191 without DM) estimated a relative risk of 1.5 for clinically defined Alzheimer disease and 2.5 for vascular dementia in diabetic persons compared to nondiabetic individuals . Furthermore, a recent prospective study showed that elevated blood glucose in the absence of DM increases the risk of dementia .

In patients with Parkinson disease (PD), associations between DM and more severe motor symptoms and increased levodopa requirements are described . More specifically, DM in the setting of PD is associated with more severe postural instability and gait difficulty features of PD .
