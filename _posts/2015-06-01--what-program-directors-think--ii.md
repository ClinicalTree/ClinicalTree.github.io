## Rationale and Objectives

The Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) surveys residents' educational experiences, work responsibilities, and benefits to support radiology residency programs and their directors.

## Materials and Methods

This is an observational cross-sectional study using three Web-based surveys posed to the APDR membership in the spring of 2013 (March 7–29, 2013; 44 items), the fall of 2013 (October 24 to November 15, 2013; 36 items), and the spring of 2014 (March 3–21, 2014; 49 items) on the American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core examination, organization of Clinical Competency Committees (CCCs), fellowship match, and interventional radiology (IR)–diagnostic radiology (DR) training programs.

## Results

Responses were collected electronically, results were tallied using SurveyMonkey software, and qualitative responses were tabulated or summarized as comments. Findings were reported during the 60th and 61st annual meetings of the Association of University Radiologists, respectively. The maximal response rate was 35% in the spring 2013, 39% in the fall 2013, and 39% in the spring 2014.

## Conclusions

With the ABR Core examination, radiology educators increasingly included multiple choice questions in teaching conferences. “Boards frenzy” was alive and well. The number of programs with a CCC was growing, chaired primarily by the Program Director (PD), with the most commonly used tool being the rotation evaluation. In view of “fellowship frenzy” in the third year of residency, only a minority of PDs were against a fellowship match in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). The majority of respondents replied that the new IR/DR pathway would negatively affect the DR residency.

Since 2000, the Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) has conducted an annual survey of its membership on issues affecting training in accredited residency programs in the United States and Canada. The APDR uses the data generated by the survey to promote improvements in resident education through exchange of ideas, to provide benchmarks guiding local resource allocation, to support the Radiology Residency Program Director (PD) community, and to facilitate communications with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Radiology (ABR). To make information more generally accessible, the results of the annual APDR Survey were first published in 2012. In this follow-up article, we analyze the results of the 2013 and 2014 surveys and discuss recent trends in resident education from the PD's perspective.

## Materials and methods

We performed an observational cross-sectional study using three Web-based surveys conducted between March 2013 and March 2014. Members of the 2012–2013 APDR Annual Survey Committee selected questions from those proposed by the committee members and the APDR leadership for inclusion in the surveys. The Committee Chair, with the help from other medical educators, selected and edited the highest quality questions. Before distribution, the questions were reviewed and approved by the current APDR president. The 2013 spring survey (March 7–29, 2013) had 44 items, the 2013 fall survey (October 24 to November 15, 2013) had 36 items, and the 2014 spring survey (March 3–21, 2014) had 49 items.
