## Rationale and Objectives

The factors that influence the conspicuity of polyps on computed tomographic (CT) colonography (CTC) are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to compare radiologists' visual assessment of polyp conspicuity to quantitative image features and show the relationship between visual conspicuity and the detection of colonic polyps by computer-aided detection (CAD) on CTC.

## Methods

One polyp (size range 6—10 mm) was selected from the CTC examination of each of 29 patients from a larger cohort. All patients underwent oral contrast-enhanced CTC with same-day optical colonoscopy with segmental unblinding. The polyps were analyzed by a previously validated CAD system and placed into one of two groups (detected \[ _n_ = 12\] or not detected \[ _n_ = 17\] by CAD). The study population was intentionally enriched with polyps that were not detected by the CAD system. Four board-certified radiologists, blinded to the CAD results, reviewed two- and three-dimensional CTC images of the polyps and scored the conspicuity of the polyps using a 4-point scale (0 = least conspicuous, 3 = most conspicuous). Polyp height and width were measured by a trained observer. A _t_ -test (two-tailed, unpaired equal variance) was done to determine statistical significance. Intra- and interobserver variabilities of the conspicuity scores were assessed using the weighted κ test. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship of conspicuity to polyp height and width.

## Results

A statistically significant difference was found between the average conspicuity scores for polyps that were detected by CAD compared to those that were not (2.3 ± 0.6 vs. 1.4 ± 0.8) ( _P_ = .004). There was moderate intraobserver agreement of the conspicuity scores (weighted κ 0.57 ± 0.09). Interobserver agreement was fair (average weighted κ for six pair-wise comparisons, 0.38 ± 0.15). Conspicuity was correlated with manual measurement of polyp height ( _r_ 2 = 0.38–0.56, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

This CAD system tends to detect 6—10 mm polyps that are more visually conspicuous. Polyp height is a major determinant of visual conspicuity. The generalizability of these findings to other CAD systems is currently unknown. Nevertheless, CAD developers may need to specifically target flatter and less conspicuous polyps for CAD to better assist the radiologist to find polyps in this clinically important size category.

Accurate detection and diagnosis of colonic polyps using computed tomographic (CT) colonography (CTC) is dependent upon many factors. One of the most important factors is the ability of a human observer to visually locate and properly classify polyp candidates. Unfortunately, this ability is inconsistent as demonstrated by studies that reported high intra- and interobserver variabilities among radiologists ( ).

To ensure that patients are properly diagnosed, it is desirable to both reduce observer variability and increase average diagnostic performance. One way to achieve these goals is through the use of computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. For example, CAD systems are available to help detect breast cancers on mammography, pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography and polyps on CTC.
