## Rationale and Objectives

Low specificity of traditional ultrasound in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules leads to a great number of unnecessary (ie, benign) fine-needle aspiration biopsies that causes a significant financial and physical burden to the patients. Ultrasound shear wave elastography is a technology capable of providing additional information related to the stiffness of tissues. In this study, quantitative stiffness values acquired by ultrasound shear wave elastography in two different imaging planes were evaluated for the prediction of malignancy in thyroid nodules. In addition, the association of elasticity measurements with sonographic characteristics of thyroid gland and nodules is presented.

## Materials and Methods

A total number of 155 patients (106 female and 49 male) (average age 57.48 ± 14.44 years) with 173 thyroid nodules (average size 24.89 ± 15.41 mm, range 5–68 mm) scheduled for fine-needle aspiration biopsy were recruited from March 2015 to May 2017. Comb-push shear elastography imaging was performed at longitudinal and transverse anatomic planes. Mean (E  mean ) and maximum (E  max ) elasticity values were obtained.

## Results

Measurements at longitudinal view were statistically significantly higher than measurements at transverse view. Nodules with calcifications were associated with increased elasticity, and nodules with a vascular component or within an enlarged thyroid gland (goiter) were associated with a lower elasticity value. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for E  mean and E  max at each imaging plane and for the average of both planes. Sensitivity of 95.45%, specificity of 86.61%, 0.58 positive predictive value, and 0.99 negative predictive value were achieved by the average of the two planes for each E  mean and E  max parameters, with area under the curve of 92% and 93%, and a cutoff value of 49.09 kPa and 105.61 kPa, respectively.

## Conclusions

The elastic properties of thyroid nodules showed promise to be a good discriminator between malignant and benign nodules ( _P_ < .0001). However, probe orientation and internal features such as calcifications, vascular component, and goiter may influence the final elastography measurements. A larger number of malignant nodules need to be studied to further validate our results.

## Introduction

Thyroid nodules commonly grow inside the thyroid gland and are mostly benign. Only 4%–6.5% of all thyroid nodules are cancerous . The majority of individuals with thyroid nodules have no symptoms. The nodules are usually found during routine physical examination with some incidental findings seen on diagnostic imaging (eg, ultrasound \[US\], computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography) performed for other indications . The current first line of evaluation of thyroid nodules encompasses thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone laboratory tests, and ultrasonography of the thyroid gland. Ultrasonography is noninvasive and reveals many features relevant to the pathology of nodules. For example, an increased risk of malignancy has been associated with the presence of microcalcifications, irregular or spiculated margins with no halo, marked hypoechogenicity, mostly solid composition, and taller than wider shape. Although increased intranodular vascularity itself is not useful for differentiation of malignant from benign nodules , disordered central hypervascularity is more specific to US features of malignancy . On the other hand, presence of peripheral vascularity, round shape, isoechogenicity, spongiform appearance, smooth margins, and cystic composition are associated with benignancy .

Many studies have concluded that US features alone suffer from low accuracy. As such, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is often used to rule out cancer in thyroid nodules . Although FNA is a safe and widely used procedure, complications such as discomfort or local pain and self-limited small hematomas may occur . Approximately 60%–80% of FNAs result in benign findings .
