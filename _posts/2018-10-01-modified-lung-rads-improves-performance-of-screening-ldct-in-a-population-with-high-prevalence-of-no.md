## Objectives

We proposed a modification of the ACR Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) to clarify the characteristics of subsolid nodules with categories 1–11, and to compare the diagnostic accuracy with Lung-RADS and National Lung Screening Trial criteria in an Asian population with high prevalence of adenocarcinoma.

## Methods

We analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1978 consecutive healthy subjects (72.8% nonsmoker) who underwent low-dose computed tomography from August 2013 to October 2014 (1084 men, 894 women). Lung-RADS categories 2 and 3 were modified to include subcategories of 2A/2B/2C and 3A/3B/3C, respectively. Clinical information and nodule characteristics were recorded. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to compare diagnostic accuracy at different cutoffs.

## Results

Thirty-two subjects (30 nonsmokers) had pathology-proven adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions in the follow-up period (1.6 ± 0.5 years). Modified Lung-RADS, using modified Lung-RADS category 2C as cutoff, had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.973 in predicting adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions (sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 89.3%), which was significantly higher than that of Lung-RADS (AUC = 0.815, _P_ < .001) and National Lung Screening Trial (AUC = 0.906, _P_ < .001). Furthermore, modified Lung-RADS showed an AUC of 0.992 in predicting invasive adenocarcinoma (sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 97.8%) when category 3B was used as cutoff.

## Conclusions

Modified Lung-RADS may substantially improve sensitivity while maintaining specificity for detection of adenocarcinoma spectrum lesions in an Asian population. Compared to Lung-RADS, it has enhanced ability to differentiate invasive from indolent adenocarcinoma by more refined subclassification of subsolid nodules using two cutoff values of category 2C and 3B. The effect of using modified Lung-RADS in clinical practice must be carefully studied in prospective large cohort studies.

## Introduction

The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that annual lung screening of high-risk population with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) results in a 20% reduction in lung cancer-specific mortality compared to screening with chest radiography . However, a major concern is the high false-positive rate of NLST by setting the cutoff threshold of positive scan at 4 mm for noncalcified lung nodule . In an effort to reduce false-positive rate and standardize reporting of lung cancer screening examinations, the American College of Radiology (ACR) in 2014 released the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) . Recent studies have demonstrated that Lung-RADS, compared to NLST criteria, substantially reduces the false-positive result rate with a small corresponding decrease in sensitivity .

In general, cancer cases that are falsely classified as negative by Lung-RADS and classified as positive screen based on NLST criteria are speculated to represent less aggressive lesions, such as minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) . However, Lung-RADS was designed to be used in the United States where screening programs target high-risk smokers, and the diagnostic performance of Lung-RADS in populations with high prevalence of nonsmoking associated lung cancer, such as in China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, is unclear . Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among all cancer types in Taiwan, accounting for 19.7% of cancer mortality in 2012. In Taiwan, more than 95% of women with lung cancer are nonsmokers, and the majority of these patients have adenocarcinomas (about 83%) . More than half of women with lung cancer are diagnosed at advanced stages.
