Prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential in preventing the complications of musculoskeletal infection. In this context, imaging is often used to confirm clinically suspected diagnoses, define the extent of infection, and ensure appropriate management. Because of its superior soft-tissue contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the modality of choice for evaluating musculoskeletal infections. This article describes the MRI features along the full spectrum of musculoskeletal infections and provides several illustrative case examples.

Musculoskeletal infections are common in medical practice and represent a unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenge . Early diagnosis and treatment of these infections are crucial in order to prevent disabling sequelae . Although clinical information often reveals the body part involved and may point toward certain pathogens, even an expert physical exam is not sufficient to define the extent and nature of the inflammatory process beneath the skin surface. Therefore, imaging is often employed to provide additional information essential to management . Because of its inherent high spatial and contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides exquisite anatomic information, including the ability to evaluate both bone and adjacent soft tissue, and has been established as the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of soft-tissue abnormalities throughout the musculoskeletal system, including infection . Although imaging findings are not pathogen-specific, MRI is a highly sensitive examination allowing clinicians to confirm or exclude the clinical diagnosis of musculoskeletal infection and define the anatomical distribution and pathophysiology . This article systematically reviews the spectrum of musculoskeletal infections organized by fascial and anatomic compartments and describes the MRI features of various entities while providing relevant case examples.

## Imaging technique

Although multiple pulse sequences may be employed for the evaluation of musculoskeletal infections, a suggested imaging protocol preferred at the authors' institution consists of T1-weighted (T1W) and fluid-sensitive (short-tau inversion recovery, STIR or fat-suppressed T2-weighted, fsT2W) images in two or three planes. Because of superior fat suppression, especially along extremity curvatures, STIR images are inherently more sensitive than any other fat-suppressed sequence for the detection of soft-tissue and bone marrow edema. Compared to fsT2W images however, STIR images demonstrate lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, echo time should be kept below 30 to 40 ms to maintain high SNR. Although phlegmon and infectious/inflammatory synovitis enhance more intensely compared to reactive edema and normal synovium, respectively, it should be noted that the role of contrast is not to confirm infection, but to define the extent of the latter, outline abscesses or sinus tracts, and detect non-enhancing devitalized soft tissue or sequestrum. In some cases, because of underlying comorbidities such as renal insufficiency, contrast should be administered at a lower dose or withheld altogether. In the authors' institute, routine non-contrast imaging suffices in most circumstances. In addition, diffusion-weighted images are being exploited as an experimental tool for cases of suspected soft-tissue or intraosseous abscess.

## Classification and Imaging Features of Musculoskeletal Infections

Musculoskeletal infections can be classified into superficial lesions, which include cellulitis, infectious bursitis, and tenosynovitis; and deep lesions, which include necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis, osteitis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Further discussion will address the pathophysiology and MRI appearances of each of these entities. It should be noted that both superficial and deep infections may evolve into a phlegmon that, with increasing necrosis, may organize into an abscess .

## Cellulitis

Cellulitis refers to a non-necrotizing infection, which is restricted to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, without involvement of the underlying fascia or muscles. It is typically caused by the residual flora or exogenous contamination, with _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Streptococcus pyogenes_ being the most common offending agents. In the majority of cases, the latter gain access to the dermis through a break in the skin resulting from a penetrating injury. Though far less common, inoculation may also occur via hematogenous seeding or spread from a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Cellulitis presents with local erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness and is frequently accompanied by systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, chills, and lymphadenopathy. Although a purely clinical diagnosis is usually sufficient, an MRI study may be obtained in cases of rapidly advancing cellulitis or in cases with severe systemic manifestation, either of which may suggest an underlying deep abscess . On MRI, cellulitis is seen as skin thickening along with focal or diffuse areas of low and high signal intensity of the subcutaneous tissues on T1W and STIR/fsT2W images, respectively . There is also moderate contrast enhancement, differentiating the entity from non-inflammatory causes of soft-tissue edema, such as congestive heart failure, diabetic vascular insufficiency, or lymphatic obstruction, which do not show enhancement ( ;  Fig 1 ). Treatment is conservative, consisting of antibiotics and supportive measures, whereas surgery may be required in progressive cases, particularly if necrosis develops .
