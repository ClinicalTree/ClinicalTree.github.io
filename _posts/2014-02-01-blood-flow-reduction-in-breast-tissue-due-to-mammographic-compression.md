## Rationale and objectives

This study measures hemodynamic properties such as blood flow and hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation in the healthy human breast under a wide range of compressive loads. Because many breast-imaging technologies derive contrast from the deformed breast, these load-dependent vascular responses affect contrast agent–enhanced and hemoglobin-based breast imaging.

## Methods

Diffuse optical and diffuse correlation spectroscopies were used to measure the concentrations of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, lipid, water, and microvascular blood flow during axial breast compression in the parallel-plate transmission geometry.

## Results

Significant reductions ( _P_ < .01) in total hemoglobin concentration (∼30%), blood oxygenation (∼20%), and blood flow (∼87%) were observed under applied pressures (forces) of up to 30 kPa (120 N) in 15 subjects. Lipid and water concentrations changed <10%.

## Conclusions

Imaging protocols based on injected contrast agents should account for variation in tissue blood flow due to mammographic compression. Similarly, imaging techniques that depend on endogenous blood contrasts will be affected by breast compression during imaging.

Exogenous contrast agents are playing an increasingly important role in breast cancer screening and diagnosis, because they improve image signal-to-noise and offer novel targeting potential as tissue biomarkers. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) uses intravenous injection of gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), for example, and is currently recommended as a screening tool for high-risk women . Similarly, contrast-enhanced digital x-ray tomosynthesis often uses injection of iodine-based agents into the compressed breast . Both of these techniques rely on adequate blood flow to control the delivery, uptake, and spatial distribution of the contrast agent. Deformation of breast tissue during compression, however, can lead to modifications of regional blood flow that alter tissue oxygenation and metabolism as well as contrast agent delivery. Furthermore, the mechanical properties of tumors are generally different from those of the surrounding tissues , and these differences can lead to uncontrolled and heterogeneous vascular responses of the breast to compression. Thus, compression can significantly reduce cancer contrast.

In addition to the standard clinical techniques mentioned previously, scientists continue to explore new technologies to enhance breast cancer specificity and sensitivity. Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and tomography (DOT), for example, are novel methodologies that utilize photons in the near-infrared (NIR, 650–950 nm) tissue transmission window to measure properties of normal and diseased breast tissues noninvasively and _in vivo_ . In breast cancer, these physiological parameters typically include the concentration of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO  2 and Hb, respectively), from which total tissue hemoglobin concentration (Hb _t_ = HbO  2 \+ Hb ∝ blood volume) and blood oxygen saturation (StO  2 = HbO  2 /Hb _t_ ) are readily calculated. These hemodynamic parameters, including other tissue properties such as water and lipid concentration and reduced tissue scattering ( μ′s
μ

s

′
), all provide significant endogenous tumor contrast for the optical method. In practice, clinical DOS/DOT measurements typically involve placing breast tissue under some type of mild compression, however, and the effects of this compression on breast tissue vasculature are not generally considered in the analysis of DOT results, despite observations suggesting that compression effects are present .

![Figure 1, (a) Schematic overview. The subject is seated on a height-adjustable chair with the breast placed between two compression plates. Optical fibers couple light into and out of the tissue and are also coupled to the optoelectronics of the combined diffuse optical/diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DOS/DCS) instrument module. Skin pressure ( P ), applied force ( F ), and plate separation ( d ) are measured throughout the study. (b) Schematic view of compression plates, load sensor, pressure sensor, and optodes. To improve data quality, eight DCS detectors were colocated and data from these detectors were obtained in parallel and averaged. Twenty-six pressure sensors were located on the upper and lower plates. (c) Schematic view of pressure sensor distribution. The red star indicates the optode location. The size of the blue circles denotes the size of the sensor (15- or 25-mm diameter; size is proportional to sensitivity). (d) Experimental timeline. The initial compression was set to a nominal force of 60 N, and the subsequent compressions were set to ∼120 N. In practice, both of these force levels were limited by subject compliance.

![Figure 4, Two examples of stress–strain response during a single compression from baseline load in a pair of subjects. To remove the baseline pressure (e.g., due to the weight of the breast tissue resting on the compression plate), stress is defined as the measured change in surface pressure from the baseline (Δ P = P − P 0 , kPa). An effective strain is defined as the measured change in plate separation divided by the initial plate separation (Δ d / d 0 , %). Both the quantities were measured continuously; error bars represent the standard deviation of measurements inside a ∼4-second averaging time-window. As expected, the stress response in the low strain regimen was approximately linear, and it transitioned to an exponential response at high strain. Note that the linear range differed significantly between subjects.

Each point corresponds to the average parameter during a baseline or compressed period (e.g., as in Fig 2 a); error bars are the standard deviation of the parameter. Red dots denote postmenopausal, and blue dots, premenopausal subjects. (a) Change in surface pressure (Δ P = P − P 0 ) versus applied force (Δ F = F − F 0 ) from baseline. (b) Δ P (≃ stress) versus fractional change in plate separation (Δ d / d 0 ≃ strain). Note that, we performed linear fits over two ranges of stress: 0%–20% ( green ) and 0%–50% ( black , all data). Although the latter range includes some data points, which may be outside of the linear stress–strain regimen, we use a simple linear model for the present analysis. Approximate systolic and diastolic blood pressures for healthy persons are shown for reference.

Data were binned by Δ P = baseline (0 kPa), 5 kPa (0–10), 15 kPa (10–20), and 25 kPa (20–30) or Δ F = baseline (0 N), 15 N (0–30), 45 N (30–60), 75 N (60–90), and 105 N (90–120). Note: data from both compression time windows on both breasts for each subject are included in these figures. Error bars are standard error for each bin; the number of data points included in each bin is noted in the figures. Data marked with “*” (“**”) are statistically different than baseline (zero change) using a two-tailed t test with P < .05 (.01).
