## Rationale and Objectives

To compare prostate morphology, image quality, and diagnostic performance of 1.5-T endorectal coil magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) and 3.0-T nonendorectal coil MRI in patients with prostate cancer.

## Materials and Methods

MR images obtained of 83 patients with prostate cancer using 1.5-T MRI systems with an endorectal coil were compared to images collected from 83 patients with a 3.0-T MRI system. Prostate diameters were measured, and image quality was evaluated by one American Board of Radiology (ABR)–certified radiologist (reader 1) and one ABR-certified diagnostic medical physicist (reader 2). The likelihood of the presence of peripheral zone cancer in each sextant and local extent was rated and compared to histopathologic findings.

## Results

Prostate anterior–posterior diameter measured by both readers was significantly shorter with 1.5-T endorectal MRI than with 3.0-T MRI. The overall image quality score difference was significant only for reader 1. Both readers found that the two MRI systems provided a similar diagnostic accuracy in cancer localization, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle involvement.

## Conclusions

Nonendorectal coil 3.0-T MRI provides prostate images that are natural in shape and that have comparable image quality to those obtained at 1.5 T with an endorectal coil, but not superior diagnostic performance. These findings suggest an opportunity exists for improving technical aspects of the 3.0-T prostate MRI.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among American men. The American Cancer Society estimated that 233,000 new cases of prostate cancer would be diagnosed in 2014, and approximately 29,480 men would die of the disease . Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI), with excellent soft-tissue contrast, provides high resolution images of the pelvis for use in prostate cancer management .

The use of an endorectal coil is an essential part of the prostate 1.5-T MRI protocol in the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer . An endorectal coil is inserted tightly against the prostate during the MRI examination to increase image resolution and improve staging accuracy . However, the endorectal coil leads to deformity in the prostate contour, and the anatomic distortion resulting from it can potentially hinder the diagnosis and pathology correlation . The changes in prostate shape and volume after the introduction of an endorectal coil may cause difficulties in MRI–computed tomography fusion and radiotherapy planning . Another limitation is that patients with rectal stenosis or immediately after surgery or radiotherapy may not be good candidates for the use of the endorectal coil during MR examination .
