## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively compare the image contrast of various brain lesions on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) images and to highlight the pitfalls of 3D FLAIR.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. We examined 94 brain lesions with 2D and 3D FLAIR at 3T. First, we optimized the repetition time and echo time of 3D FLAIR with a volunteer study. Then, we assessed the conspicuity and detection of the various lesions qualitatively, and the contrast ratio between the gray or white matter and lesions was calculated as a quantitative assessment. We also performed a phantom study to investigate the effects of different flow velocities on 2D and 3D FLAIR.

## Results

With regard to the conspicuity and detection of most lesions (multiple sclerosis, ischemic lesions or infarction, brain tumors, or chronic trauma), 3D FLAIR was equal or superior to 2D FLAIR. For these lesions, the mean contrast ratios were higher on 3D FLAIR than on 2D FLAIR images. In terms of lesion conspicuity in the patients with hippocampal sclerosis and leptomeningeal metastasis, however, 3D FLAIR was equal or inferior to 2D FLAIR. The ivy sign in patients with moyamoya disease was frequently obscured on 3D FLAIR. The phantom study demonstrated that the signal–intensity ratio on 3D FLAIR decreased more rapidly with increasing velocity than that on 2D FLAIR.

## Conclusion

Although 3D FLAIR may replace 2D FLAIR images for most patients, radiologists should keep in mind that 3D has some pitfalls.

Fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) imaging is widely used for various intracranial diseases, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, acute infarction, hippocampal sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis (MS) . A recently developed three-dimensional (3D) FLAIR technique varies the flip angles of the refocusing radiofrequency (RF) pulses, which allows the echo train length to be significantly increased without incurring excessive blurring . Recent reports of 3D FLAIR in brain imaging demonstrated a reduction in pulsation artifacts and a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with two-dimensional (2D) FLAIR imaging . Furthermore, because 3D FLAIR imaging yields 3D volume data with isotropic information, thinner slice images can be acquired in any plane; this minimizes the partial volume effect between small lesions and the surrounding tissue . A previous study reported that 3D FLAIR using 1.2-mm cubic voxels was superior to 2D FLAIR for the detection of MS lesions . During our work, however, we noticed that some leptomeningeal lesions were obscured on 3D FLAIR; this suggests that 3D FLAIR may have some pitfalls that radiologists should be aware of when using this technique in clinical practice. To our knowledge, no previous studies have directly compared 2D and 3D FLAIR to evaluate various brain lesions, except the previously mentioned MS lesion. Moreover, several studies have focused on searching for the clinical importance of 3D FLAIR. The purpose of our present study was to prospectively compare the image contrast of various brain lesions on 2D and 3D FLAIR images and to highlight the pitfalls of 3D FLAIR.

## Subjects and methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board. All magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were performed with a 3T MR system (Signa EXCITE 3T; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) and were acquired in an axial plane for the 2D FLAIR sequence and in a sagittal plane for the 3D FLAIR sequence.
