_Case Review Series: Vascular and Interventional Radiology_ , 2nd edition, by Mosby Elsevier is an update and another in the classic series of case review companion books to the iconic The Requisites™. Let me begin at the end: I sincerely wish that this book had been available when I was a resident.

This book, like its companions in this series, is highly portable, well-organized, and extremely high yield. One hundred and seventy-one cases are presented in the usual format of a select few relevant images and approximately four questions pertaining to the case on one page and a short discussion on the back of that page. Most of the cases have specific cross-references to _Vascular and Interventional Radiology: The Requisites_ and also approximately one reference (some more, some less) from “The Literature” (my words). The usual presentation of three sections is used, starting with what I perceive as warm-up cases and ending with what I perceive as difficult or esoteric cases. One critique that I can make is that I might not agree with the placement of absolutely all cases into specific sections; that being said, this is rare and a minor critique, one I fully realize is quite subjective.

I do not feel that I can comment on comparisons to the first edition.

Overall, I found this book to be outstanding. In particular, for anyone who wants to review or study vascular and interventional radiology, including testing oneself, this would seem to be an excellent choice.
