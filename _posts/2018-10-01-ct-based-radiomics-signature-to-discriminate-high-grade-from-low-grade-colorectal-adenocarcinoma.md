## Rationale and Objectives

To develop and validate a computed tomography-based radiomics signature for preoperatively discriminating high-grade from low-grade colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC).

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board, and the informed consent requirement was waived. This study enrolled 366 patients with CRAC (training dataset: _n_ = 222, validation dataset: _n_ = 144) from January 2008 to August 2015. A radiomics signature was developed with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method in training dataset. Mann-Whitney _U_ test was applied to explore the correlation between radiomics signature and histologic grade. The discriminative power of radiomics signature was investigated with the receiver operating characteristics curve. An independent validation dataset was used to confirm the predictive performance. We further performed a stratified analysis to validate the predictive performance of radiomics signature in colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma.

## Results

The radiomics signature demonstrated discriminative performance for high-grade and low-grade CRAC, with an area under the curve of 0.812 (95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 0.749–0.874) in training dataset and 0.735 (95%CI: 0.644–0.826) in validation dataset. Stratified analysis demonstrated that radiomics signature also showed distinguishing ability for histologic grade in both colon adenocarcinoma and rectal adenocarcinoma, with area under the curve of 0.725 (95%CI: 0.653–0.797) and 0.895 (95%CI: 0.838–0.952), respectively.

## Conclusions

We developed and validated a radiomics signature as a complementary tool to differentiate high-grade from low-grade CRAC preoperatively, which may make contribution to personalized treatment.

## Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers globally, ranking the third and fourth as a cause of cancer-related death in women and men, respectively . Colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC) is the most common histologic type, accounting for more than 90% of CRC . The degree of differentiation of CRAC was demonstrated by numerous studies as a significant factor for prognosis . A two-tiered classification system of histologic grade (low grade = well and moderate differentiation; high grade = poor differentiation) was recommended in CRAC for better reproducibility and prognostic significance . Specifically, high-grade CRAC had higher risk to relapse after tumor resection, resulting in poorer prognosis . Preoperatively, radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy could improve local control and disease-free survival in high-risk patients with rectal cancers . However, neoadjuvant therapies also have been reported for serious side effects, such as occurrence of second cancers and adverse effects on anorectal function . Thus, to achieve maximum benefit and avoid unnecessary side effects caused by preoperatively excessive treatment, discriminating high-grade from low-grade CRAC to assist in identifying patients with high risk of recurrence before treatment would be vital for individual therapy and hence improving outcomes.

To preoperatively evaluate histologic grade, pathologic assessment of biopsy samples could offer some information of tumor differentiation, because colonoscopic biopsy is regularly used to diagnose CRC . However, as tumors were heterogeneous in space , the discrepancy may occur between biopsy and surgical specimen for evaluating histologic grade, because biopsy samples may be superficial, inadequate, or poorly oriented . Additionally, colonoscopic biopsy as an invasive examination has related side effects .

![Figure 3, Feature selection with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) binary logistic regression model. This method minimized the sum of squares of residues, with the sum of the absolute values of the selected features coefficients being not more than a tuning parameter (λ). Using 10-fold cross-validation to tune parameter (λ) selection in the LASSO model. (a) The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was plotted versus log(λ). As λ become smaller, the coefficients of more features were shrunk to 0. Using the minimum criteria and the 1 standard error of the minimum criteria (the 1-SE criteria), dotted vertical lines were drawn at the best value. The 1-SE criteria were chosen according to 10-fold cross-validation, whereas 15 radiomics features were chosen. (b) LASSO coefficient profiles of the features. A coefficient profile plot was plotted versus the log (λ). Each colored line represents the coefficient of each features. Vertical green line was drawn at the selected λ, where 15 features had nonzero coefficients.
