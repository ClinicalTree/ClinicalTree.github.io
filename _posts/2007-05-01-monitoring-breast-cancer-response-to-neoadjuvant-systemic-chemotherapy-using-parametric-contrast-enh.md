## Rationale and Objectives

Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and a common option for primary operable disease. It is important to develop standardized imaging techniques that can monitor and quantify response to NST enabling treatment tailored to each individual patient, and facilitating surgical planning. Here we present a high spatial resolution, parametric method based on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which evaluates breast cancer response to NST.

## Materials and Methods

DCE-MRI examinations were performed twice on 17 breast cancer patients, before and after treatment. Seven sets of axial breast images were sequentially recorded at 1.5 Tesla applying a three-dimensional, gradient echo at a spatial resolution ∼2 × 1.2 × 0.6 mm  3 and temporal resolution ∼2 minutes, using gadopentate dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg wt). Image analysis was based on a color-coded scheme related to physiologic perfusion parameters.

## Results

A high Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 ( _P_ < .0001) was found between the histopathologic estimation of viable neoplastic tissue volume and the segmented volume of all the pixels demonstrating fast and steady state washout after NST (colored in light red and green). Segmentation of these pixels before and after NST indicated response in terms of reduced tumor volume and a parallel decrease in enhancement rate which reflects diminished transcapillary transfer of the contrast agent.

## Conclusions

The use of a parametric MRI technique provided a means to standardize segmentation and quantify changes in the perfusion of breast neoplastic tissue in response to NST. Whether this technique can serve to predict breast cancer recurrence and survival rates requires further clinical testing.

Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) is the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer and a common option for primary operable disease. It is mainly designed to reduce tumor size, thereby improving surgical outcomes; to evaluate response to systemic therapy; and to obtain long-term, disease-free survival ( ). To achieve these goals, it is necessary to develop standardized imaging techniques that can noninvasively monitor the response of breast tumors to NST and quantify changes in their size and spread, as well as track specific biologic and physiologic markers of malignancy. Such imaging techniques could be useful in the early stages of treatment, to help predict response to chemotherapy, to enable treatment tailored to each individual patient, and to facilitate surgical planning at later treatment stages.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an important adjuvant tool for the detection and characterization of breast cancer ( ) has also been used to monitor the effects of NST ( ). Specifically, contrast-enhanced MRI provides a means to delineate the architectural and dynamic features of breast tumors and determine their size ( ). In recent years, several groups have examined whether contrast-enhanced MRI is accurate enough to evaluate residual tumor size after NST, and compared their results with final histopathologic assessment of mastectomy specimens ( ) and with data from other imaging methods such as mammography and sonography.

(a) A color-coding scheme of the various enhancement patterns using selected imaging sets at three time points. The washout pattern is coded by color hue: red signifies a decline in signal intensity from the first to the second postcontrast time points; green, no change in signal intensity in the first and second postcontrast time points, within an average noise level; and blue, an increase in signal intensity from the first to the second postcontrast time points. The washin rate is denoted by color intensity (in arbitrary units ranging from 0 to 256) and normalized to the maximum intensity in the calibration map. (b) A calibration map calculated using the experimental conditions of this study. (c) Simulated enhancement curves of the white dots in (b) for ( k trans , v e ) = (0.9, 0.6) in red and ( k trans , v e ) = (0.2, 0.4) in blue. The broken black lines in (c) demonstrate the deviation of the estimated initial rates determined by the 3TP software, from the initial rates simulated on the basis of the Tofts model ( 31 ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MonitoringBreastCancerResponsetoNeoadjuvantSystemicChemotherapyUsingParametricContrastEnhancedMRIAPilotStudy/0_1s20S107663320700092X.jpg)

Horizontal lines are drawn at the mean difference, and at the mean difference plus and minus the standard deviation of the differences. The error in estimating tumor volume from the 3TP – parametric images was estimated to be less than 10% of that volume and resulted from the nonautomated region of interest delineation of the whole breast which included enhanced regions outside the lesion (ie, blood vessels or normal breast parenchyma).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MonitoringBreastCancerResponsetoNeoadjuvantSystemicChemotherapyUsingParametricContrastEnhancedMRIAPilotStudy/3_1s20S107663320700092X.jpg)
