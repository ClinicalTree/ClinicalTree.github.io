There are certain key texts in the world, such as Shakespeare's Folio, a foundation text. Diagnostic Ultrasound, 4th Edition isÂ such a text. If it lacks the pleasing poetic pentameter of Shakespeare, it makes up for this loss with a wealth of new, exquisitely reproduced pictures and a masterful text.

The tome is massive. Two volumes, 2000 pages, and assembled by a host of ultrasound experts under the guidance of Dr Rumack. And if this is not enough, there is included online access to view videos from nearly every chapter, which makes for a nice accompaniment to the text and pictures.

The book starts with a discussion of ultrasound physics and then methodically and comprehensively takes the reader through each organ and body part. There are descriptions and images of normal anatomy, which are always helpful because anatomy forms the basis of radiology, and without the understanding of the basic anatomy as a foundation, the ability to understand and recognize the pathology is limited. The pathology is both well described and illustrated. The images are clearly but not overly annotated. Accompanying diagrams and drawings enhance the reader's understanding of a modality, which is often intimidating for radiologists.

Volume 2 is dedicated to obstetric ultrasound and imaging of the neonate and pediatric patients. This often-difficult topic is covered with grace and clarity.

There are also sections on breast and musculoskeletal ultrasound, as well as basic interventions.

Each chapter more than covers all a good radiologist needs to know about that particular organ or body part.
