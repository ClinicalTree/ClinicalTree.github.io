My only rich great uncle was a lawyer who was the general counsel for an oil company. When I first met him in the 1930s, he was retiring because he was losing his eyesight to cataracts in both eyes. In his last years, he spent most of his fortune traveling around this country and even to Europe to find someone who could cope with his cataracts. His efforts were not successful.

Some 60 years later, my eye doctor said to me, “You have cataracts growing in both eyes.”

My rich uncle flashed into my mind. My mother-in-law had cataract surgery a few years earlier. After she cleared up a hemorrhage, she could see much better. The year before, my friend Buck had a cataract removed. His was not successful and the ophthalmologist declined to do the other eye. L My secretary told me her husband had cataracts removed from both eyes. He still wore his glasses, without any corrections.

“So what are we going to do?” I asked.

“You tell me,” he answered. “You are not ready. I'm going to watch you every 4 months.”

“How will I know if you don't tell me?”
