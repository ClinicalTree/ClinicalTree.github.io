## Highlights

- Chest X-ray interpretation by reporting radiographers is noninferior to radiologists.

- Chest X-ray reporting by reporting radiographers can increase diagnostic capacity.

- Maximizing the use of reporting radiographers could streamline patient pathways.


## Rationale and Objectives

Chest X-rays (CXR) are one of the most frequently requested imaging examinations and are fundamental to many patient pathways. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of CXR interpretation by reporting radiographers (technologists).
