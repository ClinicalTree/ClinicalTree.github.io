## Rationale and Objectives

We compared contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain using different types of data acquisition techniques: periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER, BLADE) imaging versus standard k-space sampling (conventional spin-echo pulse sequence) in the unsedated pediatric patient with focus on artifact reduction, overall image quality, and lesion detectability.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-eight pediatric patients (aged 3 months to 18 years) were scanned with a clinical 1.5-T whole body MR scanner. Cross-sectional contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo sequence was compared to a T1-weighted dark-fluid fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) BLADE sequence for qualitative and quantitative criteria (image artifacts, image quality, lesion detectability) by two experienced radiologists. Imaging protocols were matched for imaging parameters. Reader agreement was assessed using the exact Bowker test.

## Results

BLADE images showed significantly less pulsation and motion artifacts than the standard T1-weighted spin-echo sequence scan. BLADE images showed statistically significant lower signal-to-noise ratio but higher contrast-to-noise ratios with superior gray-white matter contrast. All lesions were demonstrated on FLAIR BLADE imaging, and one false-positive lesion was visible in spin-echo sequence images.

## Conclusion

BLADE MR imaging at 1.5 T is applicable for central nervous system imaging of the unsedated pediatric patient, reduces motion and pulsation artifacts, and minimizes the need for sedation or general anesthesia without loss of relevant diagnostic information.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-established imaging technique and the method of choice in the evaluation of central nervous system disorders ( ). Contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI allows classification of morphologic changes; whereas CE T1-weighted (T1w) imaging is the gold standard for displaying pathologic contrast agent uptake ( ). T1w spin-echo (SE) images are widely used to study anatomic detail and pathologic abnormalities of the brain; but this technique does not provide sufficient contrast to differentiate white matter from gray matter ( ). The quality of anatomic brain images can further be degraded by artifacts; such as subject motion ( ); the unsedated pediatric patient is particularly prone to movement. Many technical approaches to reduce motion artifacts have been reported ( ). MRI with periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) proposed by Pipe ( ) offers an alternative approach to imaging in the unsedated child. Almost all published data on the use of PROPELLER MRI technique at 1.5 T used T2w or diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) techniques. Recently published data showed that the T1w FLAIR BLADE technique seems to be capable of replacing T1w SE technique; at least for axial postcontrast imaging to detect brain metastases in the adult ( ). To evaluate the effect of this technique on lesion detectability; imaging artifacts; and overall image quality in the unsedated pediatric patient; which potentially produce more artifacts than adults and have varying T1 times due to immature brain parencyhma; we compared the CE T1w SE technique with a CE T1w FLAIR BLADE sequence in the transverse plane for brain MRI.

## Materials and methods

Forty-eight nonsedated pediatric patients (male/female: 26/22; age range, 3 months to 18 years; mean age, 8 years 10 months) with 40 contrast material–uptaking lesions and one developmental venous anomaly (DVA) were examined with a routine brain MRI protocol. These consisted of lesions found in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM, _n_ = 11), acute lymphatic leukemia ( _n_ = 12), astrocytoma ( _n_ = 2), and giant cell astrocytoma in patients with a history of neurofibromatosis ( _n_ = 15) (  Table 1 ). Lesions suspicious for malignancy were proven histologically after MRI, and all other lesions were confirmed with follow-up examinations within to 6 months. Pediatric patients younger than 2 years were first fed and then placed on the scanner. All patients' heads were fixed with the help of commercially available cushions placed on both sides of the head within the coil. Written informed consent from parents was obtained, and the study was approved by the institutional review board.
