In its first edition, _RadCases Nuclear Medicine_ proves to be a high-yield compact tool for a radiology resident or practicing radiologist. Much like other books in the series, _RadCases Nuclear Medicine_ succeeds in presenting the reader with easily digestible facts and excellent images. The book contains 100 high-yield cases, and each case contains multiple clear images. What sets this series apart from other radiology casebooks is the image quality, clear accurate description of the imaging findings, and the concise, point-by-point presentation of the essential facts using an easy to read bulleted format.

Each case typically begins with the relevant images and clinical scenario. On the following page, the imaging findings are described and there are typically multiple other supporting images. A differential diagnosis is formulated and essential facts about the case are reviewed. A key “Pearls and Pitfalls” section is included at the end of each case that helps reinforce the pertinent aspects of the case relevant to clinical diagnosis and patient management. Although the number of cases is limited to 100 in the print edition, a variety of common and uncommon presentations are covered. Several excellent cases address current Nuclear Regulatory Commission guidelines in a very clear and concise method. At the end of the book, the authors have included a valuable flow chart that assists in recognizing whole-body scans. The authors have a gifted way of presenting the highlights from each case or scenario in a simple, abbreviated manner. They have distilled the essences of each topic down to the “need to know” facts.

Each copy of _RadCases Nuclear Medicine_ includes 12-month access to Thieme's excellent online resource. This outstanding bonus includes an additional 150 cases in a searchable online database. Also included is testing software that simulates taking the cases in real time. Recently, Thieme has released a mobile capable version of the software that works with portable devices, including smartphones and tablets with Android or iOS operating systems. Although the user interface can sometimes be a little slow and it is unfortunate the online access expires 12 months after activation, this online content substantially increases the value of the book.

_RadCases Nuclear Medicine_ is an excellent tool for a radiology resident preparing for their oral boards or the new CORE exam. Practicing radiologists and fellows will also find value in this relatively inexpensive review package.
