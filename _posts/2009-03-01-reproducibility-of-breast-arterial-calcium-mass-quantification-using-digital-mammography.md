## Rationale and Objectives

Breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected on mammography is frequently not included in final reports. However, previous studies have indicated that BAC may be evidence of general atherosclerotic vascular disease, and it can potentially be a useful marker of coronary artery disease. In addition, there are currently no available techniques for the quantification of calcium mass using mammography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility and inter-reader agreement of a technique for the quantification of BAC using standard digital mammography.

## Materials and Methods

BAC mass was measured in a convenient, consecutive sample of 39 women aged 49 to 82 years attending routine mammographic examinations. BAC mass measurements were performed in standard mediolateral oblique (MLO) and craniocaudal (CC) views. To assess reproducibility, the BAC measurements obtained in MLO and CC views were compared.

## Results

The measured BAC masses in CC ( _M_ CC ) and MLO ( _M_ MLO ) projections were related by _M_ CC = 0.82( _M_ MLO ) \+ 0.27 mg ( _r_ = 0.97; standard error of estimation \[SEE\], 3.44 mg). The measured BAC masses in the left ( _M_ L ) and right ( _M_ R ) breasts were related by _M_ L = 0.86( _M_ R ) − 0.06 mg ( _r_ = 0.95; SEE, 4.30 mg). The intraclass correlation coefficients for the measurement of calcium mass ranged from 0.94 in the left CC view to 0.99 in the right CC view.

## Conclusion

A densitometry technique for the quantification of BAC mass was evaluated in patients using standard full-field digital mammography. The results demonstrated that this densitometric technique for the quantification of BAC mass is highly reproducible and has excellent inter-reader agreement. This technique may provide a quantitative metric for future studies relating the severity of BAC and cardiovascular risk.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in women. Mammography is a common, inexpensive, and widely accepted test that is recommended to all middle-aged women to screen for breast cancer. Breast arterial calcification (BAC) detected on mammography is frequently not included in final reports, because it is considered a benign finding that is not relevant to the diagnosis of breast cancer. The preponderance of studies on this topic, including large cohorts in Europe and the United States, indicate that the detection and grading of BAC on mammography may be a useful marker of atherosclerosis and therefore may have value for cardiovascular risk stratification . The only exception is a smaller case-control study that reported no significant association between BAC and CAD detected on angiography .

BAC assessment could be performed during regular rounds of screening mammography with minimal added burden to radiologists. However, additional evidence from large-scale prospective studies is needed to guide recommendations for routine BAC reporting in clinical practice. Previous studies on BAC have reported only the presence or absence of calcification on mammography. The currently available full-field digital mammographic systems provide the capability to quantify BAC. We recently developed a technique for the quantification of BAC using standard full-field digital mammography and performed an anthropomorphic breast phantom study that demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying vascular calcium mass using densitometry after taking into account the effects of scatter correction, breast thickness, breast density, anatomic background, and magnification error on calcium mass .

where _K_ and _T_ are the peak kilovoltage and thickness, respectively; _S_ is the calcium calibration slope; and _a_ 1 , _a_ 2 , _b_ 1 , and _b_ 2 are fitting parameters. The fit was performed for both molybdenum and rhodium x-ray tube anodes. The relative root-mean-square error quantified by calculating the residuals was 0.84% of the mean calibration slope for the molybdenum anode and 1.05% of the mean calibration slope for the rhodium anode. The fitting of the calibration data to this two-dimensional surface permitted the calculation of calcium calibration slopes for points not explicitly sampled during the calibration process. The slope of the calibration curve was used to estimate CaHA mass from integrated signal intensity.
