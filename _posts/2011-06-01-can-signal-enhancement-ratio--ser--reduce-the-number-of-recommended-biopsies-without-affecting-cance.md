## Rationale and Objectives

We retrospectively determined if signal enhancement ratio (SER), a quantitative measure of contrast kinetics using volumetric parameters, could reduce the number of biopsy recommendations without decreasing the number of cancers detected when applied to suspicious lesions seen on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 4 or 5 lesions seen on breast MRI in 2008 that were clinically and mammographically occult yielded a final sample size of 73 lesions in 65 patients. Images were processed with in-house software. Parameters used to predict benignity/malignancy included SER total tumor volume (lesion volume above a 70% initial enhancement level), SER partial tumor volume (volume with “washout” and “plateau” kinetics), SER washout tumor volume, peak SER, and peak percent enhancement. Thresholds were determined to retrospectively discriminate benign from malignant histopathology. Clinical impact was assessed through the reduction in the number of biopsies recommended (by eliminating benign lesions discriminated by SER).

## Results

Based on the original radiologist interpretations, 73 occult lesions were called suspicious and biopsied with a predictive value of biopsies (PPV  3 ) of 18/73 (25%). SER parameters were found to be significantly associated with histopathology ( _P_ < .05). Biopsy recommendations could be reduced using SER parameters of SER partial tumor volume (73 to 40), SER total tumor volume (73 to 45), and peak percent enhancement (73 to 55) without removing true positives.

## Conclusion

The adjunctive use of SER parameters may reduce the number of recommended biopsies without reducing the number of cancers detected.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive method for detecting and diagnosing breast cancer. MRI is able to identify new malignancies occult to mammography or clinical breast examination and is used widely in clinical practice . However, because of its variable specificity, breast MRI has been controversial for causing a high proportion of benign biopsies and changes in surgical management . Improving diagnostic accuracy of histopathology by imaging alone would strongly impact the clinical management of these lesions. Increasing the specificity of MRI is a particular unmet need and could be resolved through better discrimination of which lesions are benign and therefore don’t require biopsy.

Signal enhancement ratio (SER), a quantitative method for characterizing neoangiogenesis in breast cancer, is a semiautomated, reproducible, computational analysis of MRI images acquired in regular clinical practice . It measures change in contrast signal intensity over three time points and acts as a surrogate marker for contrast kinetics. The overall analysis monotonically approximates the redistribution rate constant ( _k_ ep ) in a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model when postcontrast time points are sampled appropriately . Variations of the SER technique have been incorporated in computer-aided detection breast MRI software. The SER technique has been applied in a variety of implementations, including curve classification, most-suspicious pixel cluster, or enhancing lesion volume . Although these investigations have looked at the ability of SER to improve diagnostic accuracy, few have specifically reviewed the impact of volumetric parameters.

Clinical Impact of MRI Signal Enhancement Ratio (SER) Parameters


Method Biopsies Recommended PPV  3  (Biopsy Yield of Malignancy) Initial MRI interpretation 73 25% Total tumor volume 45 40% SER partial tumor volume 40 45% SER washout tumor volume 73 25% Peak PE 55 33%

MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; PE, percent enhancement; SER, signal enhancement ratio.


Biopsies recommended are based on the number of total biopsies recommended by original radiologist’s MRI interpretation minus lesions retrospectively predicted to be benign using empirically derived thresholds at which a parameter performs with 100% sensitivity.


Initial MRI interpretation is defined as the original radiologists’ interpretations performed prospectively as part of routine clinical care and incorporates both Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System morphologic descriptors and a qualitative assessment of contrast kinetics.

Whiskers correspond to the minimum and maximum of data. P values were determined using Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Dashed lines represent the thresholds for SER parameters with 100% sensitivity (beyond which all lesions are benign). Thresholds were not assessed for peak SER enhancement because of nonsignificant association with pathologic outcome.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/CanSignalEnhancementRatioSERReducetheNumberofRecommendedBiopsieswithoutAffectingCancerYieldinOccultMRIdetectedLesions/1_1s20S1076633211000882.jpg)
