## Rationale and Objectives

This work aimed to study the effects of scanner model and study protocol on radiation dose received by breast tissues from 64-slice computed tomography (CT) studies.

## Materials and Methods

Four scanner models and three study protocols were used in scanning an anthropomorphic phantom with breast modules. Each protocol follows recommendations or guidelines from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine and the American College of Radiology. Twenty thermoluminescent dosimeters were placed inside the breast modules to measure breast tissue doses. Both the absolute and the normalized breast tissue doses were analyzed.

## Results

The mean glandular doses of a lung cancer screening CT, a chest/abdomen/pelvis CT, and a virtual colonoscopy CT are equivalent to less than 1, 5–7, and 1–3 two-view digital mammograms, respectively, for a standard-sized patient. The normalized breast dose differs significantly ( _P_ < 0.01) between lung cancer screening CT and chest/abdomen/pelvis CT; however, it shows less than ±10% variation among scanner models for the same protocol. In virtual colonoscopy CT, breast tissue dose decreases with the distance between local tissues to the edge of the x-ray field, although the decreasing trend varies for different scanner models and protocol settings.

## Conclusions

When breasts are entirely included in the primary x-ray field, breast dose by 64-slice CT is mainly protocol dependent, with the normalized breast dose about 15% lower for protocols with modulated mA than for those with constant mA; when breasts are only partially included in the primary beam field, breast dose by 64-slice CT is dependent on both the scanner model and the protocol settings.

## Introduction

In recent years, public concerns over computed tomography (CT) radiation dose and its associated risks have spurred efforts to understand, manage, and optimize patient dose from CT studies . Among these efforts, the recording and reporting of patient dose play an important role for patient management in clinical practice. Although CT dose index (CTDI), a metric directly available from scanners, has long been used in reporting scanner radiation output, its practical value is limited because of its inability to account for patient variation. Organ dose has been considered a more valuable and suitable metric to meet clinical needs; it gives physical characterization of patient-specific radiation dose and forms the basis for risk estimates.

The determination of organ dose is a challenging task. The organ is affected not only by the scanner radiation output level, usually characterized by CTDI, but also by various other factors, such as patient size, study protocol, scanner model, and x-ray energy spectrum. A number of studies have been conducted with the aim of developing a robust yet simple method with acceptable accuracy for organ dose estimation . These studies employed either experimental methods using physical phantoms or numerical methods using validated Monte Carlo programs, although the majority of them were based on the latter because of the flexibility of simulation.

where CTDI  vol,global is the displayed CTDI  vol from the scanner, representative of the dose index averaged over the entire scanner anatomy. For protocols using tube current modulation, CTDI  vol,regional is more accurate than CTDI  vol,global in characterizing the radiation output used on breast tissues. For protocols using constant mA, CTDI  vol,regional becomes equal to CTDI  vol,global .

![Figure 5, The normalized breast tissue dose on four scanner models for the three studied protocols: lung cancer screening, chest/abdomen/pelvis, and virtual colonoscopy. Across the four 64-slice computed tomography (CT) scanner models, the normalized dose averaged over the entire breasts falls within ±5% of 1.05 and ±10% of 0.90 for the lung cancer screening protocol and the chest/abdomen/pelvis protocol, respectively. For the virtual colonoscopy protocol, however, both larger differences in the normalized dose among different scanner models and larger error bars are observed; this is primarily because of the fact that the breasts are only partially included in the primary x-ray field for such studies. For this reason, additional analysis of thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) data was performed for the virtual colonoscopy protocol, with the result shown in Figure 6 .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/RadiationDosetotheBreastby64sliceCT/4_1s20S1076633216300253.jpg)
