## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (  18 F-FDG PET/CT) volume-metabolic combined parameters in patients with cervical carcinoma.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 91 consecutive patients' whole-body FDG-PET/CT images, and further measured and calculated FDG PET/CT volume-metabolic parameters, including cervical metabolic tumor volume (CMTV), cervical total lesion glycolysis (CTLG), whole-body metabolic tumor volume (WB-MTV), whole-body total lesions glycolysis (WB-TLG). The prognostic value of these tumor volume-metabolic measures was assessed by Cox Proportional Hazard Regression Analysis.

## Results

The overall survival (OS) was 88.8% for patients with low CMTV (≤53.75 mL) and 45.5% for those with high CMTV (>53.75 mL), respectively ( _P_ < 0.01, 95% confidence interval). Univariate analysis showed that CMTV and CTLG were significant prognostic factors for OS, in addition to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, age, lymphadenopathy, and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) ( _P_ < 0.05 for all). On multivariate analysis, CMTV remained significant for OS, in addition to FIGO stage ( _P_ < 0.05 for all). CMTV remains as prognostic factor for OS regardless of patients' FIGO stages ( _P_ < 0.05). In patients in the metastatic diseases group, univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that CMTV, WB-MTV, and WB-TLG were independent prognostic factors for OS ( _P_ < 0.05 for all).

## Conclusion

CMTV, WB-MTV, and WB-TLG are reliable prognostic factors for patients with cervical carcinoma and should be included in FDG-PET/CT reports to guide referral clinicians for risk-adapted therapies.

## Introduction

Cervical carcinoma is the third most common cancer in women worldwide , with 85% of cases occurring in developing countries, where it is the second most frequent cause of cancer death in the female population . 18-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (  18 F-FDG PET/CT) has been shown to be useful in staging, monitoring therapy response , and predicting prognostication of primary cervical cancer. Recent studies have shown that the volume-based parameter of  18 F-FDG PET, three-dimensional measurements of total tumor metabolic activity, is a more useful measure than the concentration-based standardized uptake value (SUV) in many cancers . Various quantitative and qualitative  18 F-FDG PET/CT parameters have been found to be useful predictors of survival in primary cervical cancer . Among those, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) have been reported to be independent prognostic factors in patients with primary cervical cancer . In this retrospective study, we intended to identify the prognostic value of volume-based PET/CT metabolic parameters (whole-body metabolic tumor volume \[WB-MTV\], whole-body total lesions glycolysis \[WB-TLG\], cervical metabolic tumor volume \[CMTV\], and cervical total lesion glycolysis \[CTLG\]) in patients with cervical carcinoma.

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

The institutional review board approved this retrospective study, and the requirement to obtain informed consent was waived. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients (from April 2007 and September 2013) with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I B1 through FIGO stage IV B cervical cancer who underwent  18 F-FDG PET/CT. A total of 91 eligible patients were identified for this analysis. The characteristics of the 91 eligible patients with cervical cancer are listed in  Table 1 . The median of OS duration was 25 months with a range of 11–69 months. The 1- and 5-year OS were 85% and 71%, respectively.
