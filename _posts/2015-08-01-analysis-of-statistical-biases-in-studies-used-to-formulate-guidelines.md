## Rationale and Objectives

To analyze the statistical biases in the studies used to derive cardiac magnetic resonance–based major and minor criteria for the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).

## Materials and Methods

ARVC is a rare disorder of the heart that can lead to sudden death in young adults. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) plays a role in the diagnosis by contributing to the criteria set by experts. The original criteria emphasized qualitative analysis of CMR. The criteria were modified in 2010 to provide quantitative cutoffs.

## Results

We apply the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for systematic review of diagnostic accuracy to the studies cited in the guidelines written in 1994 and revised in 2010. We use the signaling questions in QUADAS-2 to identify different types of statistical bias.

## Conclusions

The studies have understandable biases that affect the sensitivity and specificity of CMR in the diagnosis of ARVC, as well as the truth of the disease state. There is potential to overdiagnose ARVC particularly in low prevalence populations.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a rare cardiomyopathy that primarily affects the right ventricle (RV) and is potentially fatal if untreated . The incidence is 1 in 5000 individuals . Affected individuals can present with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death and typically present in the third decade of life. There is a genetic component of unclear magnitude .

A task force was established in 1994 , and another convened in 2009, , to develop criteria for the diagnosis of ARVC (  Table 1 ). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) contributes to the criteria for the diagnosis of ARVC.

ARVC/D, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia; QUADAS-2, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies.


Each study is evaluated on four domains–patient selection, index test, reference standard, and flow and timing–for the risk of bias and applicability concerns. The format of the results reported here follows the downloadable template provided at  http://www.quadas.org  .
