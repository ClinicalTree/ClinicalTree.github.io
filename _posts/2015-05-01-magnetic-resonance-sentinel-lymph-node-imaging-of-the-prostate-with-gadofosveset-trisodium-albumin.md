## Rationale and Objectives

To determine if intraprostatic injection of gadofosveset trisodium mixed with human serum albumin (HSA) can identify sentinel lymph nodes (LNs) draining the prostate on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a canine model.

## Materials and Methods

Three male canines weighing between 25.7 and 41.3 kg were anesthetized, placed in a 3-T MRI, and a needle was placed transrectally into one side of the prostate using a commercially available intrarectal needle guide. Gadofosveset trisodium premixed with 10% HSA was then administered at doses ranging from 0.1 to 2.5 mL. T1W MRI was performed immediately after injection, and two readers evaluated images for visualization of LNs draining the prostate.

## Results

Intraprostatic injection of 0.2 mL gadofosveset trisodium premixed with HSA identified the draining periprostatic LNs in all cases. Delayed images demonstrated upper echelon nodes in the pelvis and the abdomen. Higher volume injections resulted in excessive periprostatic extravasation, whereas lower volume injections resulted in suboptimal visualization of LNs.

## Conclusions

We demonstrate that gadofosveset trisodium (premixed with 10% HSA) injected intraprostatically at 0.2 mL visualized LNs draining the prostate. This approach can be readily adapted for clinical applications such as sentinel LN imaging in prostate cancer patients before surgery.

Identification of lymph node metastasis is important for the accurate staging of prostate cancer (PCa). Current anatomic and functional imaging techniques have limited accuracy in the detection of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) . Therefore, surgical pelvic LN dissection (PLND) remains the gold standard for nodal staging . The most common surgical approach to PLND includes resection of nodes in the obturator fossa; however, this technique fails to detect almost 30% of metastatic LNs . For this reason, extended PLND (EPLND), including additional pelvic wall nodes and iliac LN chains, is currently the preferred method in higher risk patients . Although decreasing the false-negative rate for PCa, EPLND results in more complications such as lymphoceles, thromboembolic events, ureteral injury, and neurovascular injury due to the invasiveness of the surgery , and therefore, a more targeted approach to LN resection is desirable.

A variety of imaging approaches have been used to identify malignant nodes in the pelvis. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) use size criteria to judge whether a node is malignant. Unfortunately, both methods experience a low sensitivity and specificity around 0.39–0.42 and 0.82, respectively . Recently, functional MRI, specifically diffusion-weighted MRI, has been used to detect normal-sized metastatic nodes in patients with prostate and bladder cancer diagnosed as N0 with conventional cross-sectional imaging techniques . However, these results require further validation as the specificity may not be sufficient for clinical purposes. MRI performed 24 hours after intravenous injection of an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide agent has been reported to identify metastatic nodes by the absence of uptake of iron. However, this method is not yet widely available as the ideal agent, ferumoxtran, is not currently commercially available . Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose has a low sensitivity in PCa but good specificity for nodal metastases .
