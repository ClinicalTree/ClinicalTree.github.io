> Pageants teach the exact same skills as sports do: goal setting, “can do” attitude, and performance under pressure. But in pageants you wear much better shoes!  Valerie Hayes

On May 3, 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia, Arthy Saravanan was crowned Mrs. India International 2014. Several factors made this event particularly remarkable. As a child, Arthy had been a tomboy, more interested in cars, tree climbing, and playing sports with her older brother than dressing up. She had no experience with pageants of any kind, and until just a few months before the contest, she had never heard of Mrs. India International. At the time of the contest, she was still nursing her 10-month-old daughter. And perhaps most remarkably, she was working full time as a radiology resident.

Arthy's experiences as Mrs. India International make a fascinating story and offer surprisingly germane insights into professionalism. Before turning to these, a brief sketch of her life is in order. Arthy was born in southern India, moved with her family to Oman for most of her childhood, and then relocated to Toronto. She majored in human biology at the University of Toronto, attended medical school at Indiana University, and then matched in radiology at Northeast Ohio Medical University.

Throughout college, medical school, and residency, Arthy also practiced classical Indian dance. After studying and performing professionally for 10 years, she was qualified to teach, and during her residency training, she started a Zumba fitness class at her local YMCA in Canton, Ohio.

During Arthy's third year of training, she was having a conversation with a friend about the changes that had taken place in their lives since they married and became mothers. Her friend was moved by Arthy's account of how she was spending less and less time pursuing her own individual interests, yet finding life more and more fulfilling. She asked Arthy for a copy of her resume and a few photographs, which on a lark Arthy supplied. A few weeks later, she received a request from the Mrs. India International pageant for more photos and a “ramp walk” video.
