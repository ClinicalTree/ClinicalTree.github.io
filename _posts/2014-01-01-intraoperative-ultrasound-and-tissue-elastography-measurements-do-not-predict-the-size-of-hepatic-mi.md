## Rationale and Objectives

Image-guided thermal ablation is used to treat primary and secondary liver cancers. Evaluating completeness of ablation is difficult with standard intraoperative B-mode ultrasound. This study evaluates the ability of B-mode ultrasound (US) and tissue elastography to adequately measure the extent of ablation compared to pathologic assessment.

## Materials and Methods

An in vivo porcine model was used to compare B-mode ultrasonography and elastography to pathologic assessment of the microwave ablation zone area. In parallel, intraoperative ablations in patients were used to assess the ability of B-mode US and elastographic measures of tissue strain immediately after ablation to predict ablation size, compared to postprocedural computed tomography (CT).

## Results

In the animal model, ablation zones appeared to decrease in size when monitored with ultrasound over a 10-minute span with both B-mode US and elastography. Both techniques estimated smaller zones than gross pathology, however, the differences did not reach statistical significance. Biopsies from the edges of the ablation zone, as assessed by US, contained viable tissue in 75% of the cases. In the human model, B-mode US and elastography estimated similar ablation sizes; however, they underestimate the final size of the ablation defect as measured on postprocedure CT scan (median area \[interquartile range\]: CT, 7.3 cm  2 \[5.2–9.5\] vs. US 3.6 cm  2 \[1.7–6.3\] and elastography 4.1 cm  2 \[1.4–5.1\]; _P_ = .005).

## Conclusions

Ultrasound and elastography provide an accurate gross estimation of ablation zone size but are unable to predict the degree of cellular injury and significantly underestimate the ultimate size of the ablation

Thermal ablation is an accepted therapeutic alternative in selected patients with primary or metastatic liver neoplasms. This approach is used primarily for tumors that are considered inappropriate for resection because of tumor- (multiplicity, location within the liver) or patient-related factors (comorbidities or small, predicted, future liver remnant) . Local recurrence, however, is common and has been associated with tumor size and tumor location .

The ideal image guidance modality would assist in preoperative planning, lesion targeting, real-time ablation monitoring, and ablation zone assessment . Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) is the most widely used image guidance modality, given its availability, relative ease of use, and ability to provide feedback for ablation probe placement (lesion targeting) . However, heat-induced artifact and the underlying characteristics of the liver parenchyma (i.e., steatosis, cirrhosis, and chemotherapy-associated changes) significantly impact ablation zone monitoring and assessment during and immediately after the ablation has taken place. As a result, complete destruction of tumor tissue is impossible to confirm . In addition, it is unclear how this technical limitation influences local recurrence rates .
