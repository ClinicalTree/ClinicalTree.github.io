## An Educational Update on Respiratory Diseases

Many radiologists are working harder than ever before, and radiology is such a rapidly evolving field that many of its practitioners find it challenging just to keep up with developments in imaging, let alone other medical specialties. Yet the rest of medicine is evolving as well, and it is important that radiologists remain abreast of new developments in fields that are likely to impact their practice.

Because the single most commonly performed radiological study is the chest radiograph, and because respiratory signs and symptoms are among the most common reasons for patients to seek medical attention, new developments in pulmonary medicine are likely to be particularly relevant. This article provides a brief refresher on four of the most common and life-threatening pulmonary disorders that radiologists are likely to encounter on a regular basis: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

## Asthma

The word asthma comes from a Greek root meaning “panting.” It is estimated that about 37 million Americans have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their life, but only about 23 million currently carry the diagnosis. This amounts to a little over 7% of the US population. Perhaps in part because airways are smaller to begin with, asthma tends to be a more serious problem in younger populations, with a peak prevalence between the ages of 5 and 14 years. In patients younger than 18 years, asthma is more common in males, but in adulthood it is more common in females .

Asthma is a common reason patients seek medical attention, with approximately 14 million primary care visits and nearly 2 million emergency department visits each year . It is the most common reason children are admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. On the other hand, the mortality rate of asthma is relatively low, with fewer than 4000 deaths per year in the United States .

Asthma is an inflammatory disease that affects the larger, conducting airways to a greater extent than COPD, which predominates in smaller airways. It has a strong genetic component and tends to be associated with atopy, a predisposition to allergic rhinitis and eczema. Yet there is also an important environmental component, which may include exposure to a variety of allergens, as well as cold air and exercise.

The principal factors involved in the pathogenesis of asthma include bronchial smooth muscle hyperreactivity, inflammatory bronchial wall thickening, and increased mucus production. In the early phases of an attack, the release of histamine from mast cells and acetylcholine from parasympathetic neurons cause bronchoconstriction and mucus production, followed by leukotriene release from other inflammatory cells such as eosinophils and neutrophils. Long term, asthma can result in permanent airway narrowing .
