## Rationale and Objectives

Higher patient exposure levels have been reported for 64-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) compared to 16-row MDCT. The objective of this study was to make a thorough comparison by evaluating the impact of scan length on the exposure levels at 16-row MDCT and 64-row MDCT.

## Materials and Methods

Dose-length product (DLP) values were determined to compare exposure levels in 16- and 64-row MDCT. This phantom study does not deal with a possible reduction in image quality induced by an increase in scattered radiation in 64-row MDCT compared to 16-row MDCT.

## Results

The exposure levels of 64-row MDCT (scan slice thickness, 0.5 mm) are up to 18% lower than those of 16-row MDCT at slice thickness 0.5 mm when scanning an object larger than 12.3 cm. At this value, the plots of the 16- and 64-row DLP values versus scan length cross. The DLP curves of 1- and 2-mm slice thickness 16-row MDCT are in closer resemblance to those of 0.5-mm 64-row MDCT. The respective exposure levels of 1- and 2-mm slice thickness 16-row MDCT exceed those of 0.5-mm 64-row MDCT by up to 4% and 3%, with intersections of 30 and 25 cm, respectively.

## Conclusion

Lower effective doses are obtained in 64-row MDCT compared to 16-row MDCT (0.5-mm slice thickness) provided that scan length exceeds 12.3, 30, and 25 cm, for 16-row MDCT slice thickness of 0.5, 1, and 2 mm, respectively. Reduced effective dosage in 64-row MDCT compared to 16-row MDCT has not been demonstrated before. Differences in object size may thus explain discrepancies between previous studies with regard to the exposure levels at 64-slice CT compared to 16-slice CT.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has become increasingly important as a noninvasive imaging modality since its introduction in 1998 ( ). Research on patient dosage, a major concern in MDCT examinations, has been ongoing for many years ( ). In young patients in particular, special attention to this matter is required. An accurate analysis of patient dose in MDCT as a function of beam width, often referred to as collimation, is nevertheless still lacking.

The CT dose index (CTDI) value is frequently used as reference for dose exposed under clinical conditions. CTDI can be measured inside a defined phantom (CTDI  weighted ) in air (CTDI  air ) or in other ways. As CTDI measurements inside a phantom are linearly related to those in air, an analysis of exposure ratios can be done using CTDI  air . Furthermore, CTDI represents the output of tube/filter combination under specified conditions. Exposure to the patient, specified as dose-length product (DLP), is used as measure of exposure in the scan procedure ( ).

where _N_ s the number of slices, _T_ (mm) is the nominal slice thickness, _d(z)_ is the dose profile for an axial scan, and the integral is taken over the interval of 100-mm scan length.  Figure 1 demonstrates that the dose profile varies with the beam width, resulting in different CTDI values. Because the absolute width of the penumbra (hatched areas) and thus additional radiation exposure, due to the penumbra is almost independent of the nominal beam width, the contribution of the penumbra will have the greatest relative effect on both image quality and patient exposure if the nominal band width is small (  Fig. 1 , top).

![Figure 1, Top : Typical relative dose profile as a function of beam width (BW). The penumbra is illustrated in the hatched area . Bottom : The relative contribution of penumbra to total exposure becomes less relevant with increasing beam width. Notice that the penumbras of both profiles are approximately the same.

where _L_ is the scan length, _BW  nom_ is the nominal beam width, and _P_ is the CT pitch, which is determined by the couch-top movement and the number of slices ( ).

_P_ = .9375 for 16-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and _P_ = .8281 for 64-row MDCT. Separate experiments had established that the CT dose index (CTDI) varies with beam width. For beam widths of 8 mm (16 × 0.5) and 32 mm (64 × 0.5), the CTDI  air  values were 20.6 and 14.3 mGy, respectively. For 139 mAs effective, this results in CTDI  vol-air  = 21.97 mGy (16-row MDCT) and CTDI  vol-air  = 17.27 mGy (64-row MDCT).
