## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively assess the value of spectral presaturation by inversion-recovery (SPIR) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequence after gadolinium injection to differentiate fibrotic scar tissue and tumoral infiltration within the mesorectal fat in patients with rectal carcinoma undergoing MR restaging after neoadjuvant chemo- and radiation therapy (CRT).

## Materials and Methods

Forty-three consecutive patients (mean age, 65.8 years; range, 46–85 years; male:female, 29:14) with locally advanced rectal carcinoma underwent CRT followed by surgery. MR imaging was performed before and after completion of CRT by using T2-weighted turbo spin-echo and T1-weighted SPIR sequences before and after gadolinium injection, and MR images were assessed by two radiologists in consensus. Logistic regression was conducted to test the significance of the MR image findings with histology.

## Results

After CRT the disease was either limited to the rectal wall ( _n_ = 18 patients) or presented perirectal infiltration ( _n_ = 25) on histology. In 21 patients, mesorectal enhancing strands were observed. Reticular-shaped enhancing strands reaching the mesorectal fascia presented the highest correlation with tumor infiltration of the mesorectal fat (OR 130.33, 95% CI: 4.1–4220.29; logistic regression), whereas linear-shaped enhancing strands either reaching or not reaching the mesorectal fascia (OR 0.25 or 0.1, 95% CI: 0.024–2.6 or 0.01–1.07) revealed the lowest correlation.

## Conclusions

Reticular-shaped enhancing strands on SPIR MR imaging after gadolinium injection are associated with tumor infiltration of the mesorectal fat.

Total mesorectal excision is widely accepted as standard surgical practice for rectal cancer , and it provides the best chance of a tumor-free circumferential resection margin . Local recurrence is directly related to incomplete resection of the tumor and the most important parameter related to local recurrence is the distance between the tumor and the mesorectal fascia . Locally advanced rectal cancer with extramural spread (T3 tumor) has high frequency of local recurrence and metastasis. Nowadays, the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer consists of preoperative neoadjuvant concomitant radiation and chemotherapy (CRT) followed by standard resection of the rectum and resection of the surrounding organs .

The classic approach of defining the T stage of the tumor is based on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or endoscopic ultrasound and may lead to staging failures in the differentiation of T2 and borderline T3 tumors . The measurement of tumor extent relative to the mesorectal fascia and the prediction of tumor-free resection margins on the basis of MR imaging may be more feasible than defining the T stage . MR imaging has an accuracy of 66% in predicting resection margin involvement during restaging of irradiated rectal cancers (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 35%; positive predictive value, 58%; negative predictive value, 100%) . The reported overall accuracy of MR imaging in predicting the pathologic stage of nonirradiated rectal cancer is 71%–91% (mean, 85%) for T staging, and 43%–85% (75%) for N staging . However, the reported overall accuracy of MR imaging in the restaging of irradiated rectal cancer is much lower being 47%–54% (50%) for T staging and 64%–68% (65%) for N staging , and it is even worse for mucin-producing tumors.
