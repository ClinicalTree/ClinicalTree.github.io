## Rationale and Objectives

The magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence regularly shows caudal image contrast inversion at 7 T and therefore reduced clinical applicability. The investigators report the technical source of this problem and present a practical solution.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 71 subjects were scanned using a 7-T whole-body magnetic resonance imaging system using a 32-channel transmit/receive head coil. In 39 subjects, 45 high-resolution T1 contrast image data sets were acquired with the standard MPRAGE sequence. A modified sequence with an adiabatic wideband uniform rate smooth truncation pulse for magnetization preparation was used for 45 further scans in 39 subjects. In total, seven subjects underwent scans with both sequences. The homogeneity of T1 contrast and the occurrence of caudal image contrast inversion were evaluated in consensus reading by two neuroradiologists.

## Results

Caudal image contrast inversion was depicted in 19 acquisitions (42.2%) using the standard MPRAGE sequence. Using the adiabatic wideband uniform rate smooth truncation pulse for magnetization preparation, caudal image contrast inversion was depicted in only three acquisitions (6.7%). A χ  2 test showed a significant difference between the two preparation pulses ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Magnetization preparation with an adiabatic wideband uniform rate smooth truncation pulse in the MPRAGE sequence at 7 T can significantly reduce the occurrence of caudal image contrast inversion and improves signal homogeneity.

Ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 T is currently being considered for clinical application . Many technical difficulties have been mastered already, but several issues remain to be solved. Reliability and reproducibility of the acquired images are two of the main goals that must be achieved. The magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo (MPRAGE) sequence using a hyperbolic secant inversion pulse is a standard sequence for T1 contrast brain imaging at high magnetic field strengths ; unfortunately, it regularly shows caudal contrast inversion (CCI) at 7 T and therefore reduced clinical applicability.

Static magnetic field inhomogeneities, ΔB  0 , which arise for example from susceptibility changes at tissue boundaries, are responsible among other factors for off-resonance frequency content inside the field of view. At ultrahigh fields, off-resonance frequencies are generally higher because of the higher ΔB  0 , which scales linearly with field strength . Hence, shimming of the main magnetic field is very crucial to curtail B  0 inhomogeneities inside the imaging area . Because of the limited bandwidth of the conventional radiofrequency (RF) inversion pulse, tissues with large frequency shifts may not experience effective magnetization preparation, leading to unexpected contrast inversion.

where ω  1 = γB  1 ( _t_ ) (the RF pulse envelope times the gyromagnetic ratio γ = 42.57 MHz/T), and Δω is the frequency sweep of the adiabatic RF pulse. In principle, _Q_ should be large compared with unity: the higher the value of _Q_ , the lower the sensitivity to areas in which the maximal amplitude B  1 max of the pulse is not reached. _Q_ scales with B  1 max , but for most in vivo measurements B  1 max is restricted because of specific absorption rate (SAR) limitations. In the literature, values of _Q_ ≥ 5 have been recommended .

![Figure 2, Adiabaticity factor, Q , of a hyperbolic secant ( solid line ) and a wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) pulse ( dotted line ) for different off-resonance frequencies. In general, for each frequency, Q is smallest at the time point when that frequency is reached by the frequency sweep (cf Fig 1 b) (23) . Here the most crucial value for each frequency is plotted; for all frequencies with Q > 5, the adiabatic condition is achieved (16 20 21) . Relevant are the Q values of the frequencies inside the effective bandwidth (cf Fig 3 ). In this simulation, B 1 max = 11.7 μT was used for both the hyperbolic secant and WURST radiofrequency pulse; this is the threshold at which the hyperbolic secant pulse reaches Q = 5 at resonance.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/CaudalImageContrastInversioninMPRAGEat7Tesla/1_1s20S1076633211004600.jpg)

![Figure 3, B 1 sensitivity of both pulses for spin inversion (M z /M 0 = −1) at off-resonance frequencies. Inversion profiles of the hyperbolic secant ( solid line ) and the wideband uniform rate smooth truncation (WURST) pulse ( dotted line ) with different values for B 1 max were simulated: (a) B 1 max = 17.6 μT/13.6 μT; optimal B 1 max value for spin inversion, used in the magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient-echo protocol. (b) B 1 max = 0.4 × (17.6 μT/13.6 μT); for about half of the nominal B 1 max , the WURST pulse is still able to achieve inversion of M z /M 0 < −0.8 in the central frequency band. (c) B 1 max = 0.33 × (17.6 μT/13.6 μT); the WURST pulse still has a higher inversion rate than the hyperbolic secant pulse. (d) B 1 max = 2 × (17.6 μT/13.6 μT); doubling the optimal B 1 max would lead to almost equal inversion profiles for both pulses.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/CaudalImageContrastInversioninMPRAGEat7Tesla/2_1s20S1076633211004600.jpg)

The asterisk marks the area with inverted image contrast. The CCI was less distinct in comparison to the typical occurrence with the standard inversion pulse (cf, eg, Figs 4 a and 4 b). (b) Subsequent repeated B 0 shimming and B 1 transmitter adjustment led to correct image contrast in the second scan.
