## Rationale and Objectives

Despite increasing radiology coverage, nonradiology residents continue to preliminarily interpret basic radiologic studies independently, yet their ability to do so accurately is not routinely assessed.

## Materials and Methods

An online test of basic radiologic image interpretation was developed through an iterative process. Educational objectives were established, then questions and images were gathered to create an assessment. The test was administered online to first-year interns (postgraduate year \[PGY\] 1) from 14 different specialties, as well as a sample of third- and fourth-year radiology residents (PGY3/R2 and PGY4/R3).

## Results

Over a 2-year period, 368 residents were assessed, including PGY1 ( _n_ = 349), PGY3/R2 ( _n_ = 14), and PGY4/R3 ( _n_ = 5) residents. Overall, the test discriminated effectively between interns (average score = 66%) and advanced residents (R2 = 86%, R3 = 89%; _P_ < .05). Item analysis indicated discrimination indices ranging from −0.72 to 48.3 (mean = 3.12, median 0.58) for individual questions, including four questions with negative discrimination indices. After removal of the negatively indexed questions, the overall predictive value of the instrument persisted and discrimination indices increased for all but one of the remaining questions (range 0.027–70.8, mean 5.76, median 0.94).

## Conclusions

Validation of an initial iteration of an assessment of basic image-interpretation skills led to revisions that improved the test. The results offer a specific test of radiologic reading skills with validation evidence for residents. More generally, results demonstrate a principled approach to test development.

Basic radiology skills are critical to almost all practicing physicians. Graduate-level training in radiology has been established as an important skill with varying pedagogical approaches . With the recent emphasis on competency-based assessment , the need for valid task-based methods of assessment of radiology skills is paramount.

Because first-year residents, in programs other than radiology, must review imaging studies in settings with indirect supervision, it is especially important to assess this skill to establish competence. At times, residents with indirect supervision are asked to interpret radiographs and other imaging studies without input from a radiologist, or provide a preliminary read before receiving a somewhat delayed final radiologist's interpretation. First-year residents not specializing in radiology are often required to independently interpret basic radiologic studies, in most instances while on overnight service, however their ability to do so accurately is not routinely assessed. Residents' image-interpretation errors have been documented in various settings and specialties, although reports of the rate and severity of the errors vary . Moreover, with the increasing reliance on electronic medical records and computer-based picture archiving and communication systems, clinical radiologic education is occurring on a more limited basis. Largely gone are radiology rounds when entire clinical teams would visit the radiology department for review of the imaging and discussion of the patients on their service.
