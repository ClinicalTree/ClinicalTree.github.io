## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to improve the detection of pulmonary embolism via an iodine contrast enhancement tool in patients who underwent suboptimal enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA).

## Materials and Methods

We evaluated the CT examinations of 41 patients who underwent CTA for evaluation of the pulmonary arteries which suffered from suboptimal contrast enhancement. The contrast enhancement of the reconstructed images was increased via a post-processing tool (vContrast). Image noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were assessed in eight different regions: main pulmonary artery, right and left pulmonary arteries, right and left segment arteries, muscle, subcutaneous fat, and bone. For subjective image assessment, three experienced radiologists evaluated the diagnostic quality.

## Results

While employing the post-processing algorithm, the CNR for contrast-filled lumen and thrombus/muscle improves significantly by a factor of 1.7 (CNR without vContrast = 8.48 ± 6.79/CNR with vContrast = 14.46 ± 5.29) ( _P_ <  0.01). No strengthening of artifacts occurred, and the mean Hounsfield unit values of the muscle, subcutaneous fat, and the bone showed no significant changes. Subjective image analysis illustrated a significant improvement using post-processing for clinically relevant criteria such as diagnostic confidence.

## Conclusions

vContrast makes CT angiograms with inadequate contrast applicable for diagnostic evaluation, offering an improved visualization of the pulmonary arteries. In addition, vContrast can help in the significant reduction of the iodine contrast material.

## Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, with an overall incidence of 15.9% in adult medical autopsies . Therefore, it is important to have a diagnostic procedure offering a fast and reliable detection of PE. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the pulmonary arteries is a safe and highly accurate tool to detect or rule out PE . Nowadays, CT has become the standard imaging modality for patients with suspected PE , with the CTA representing a highly relevant diagnostic feature in clinical routine .

In day-to-day clinical routine, CTA is a robust imaging technique to evaluate pulmonary arteries. However, some examinations suffer from a suboptimal contrast opacification of the pulmonary vessels, eg, because of delayed image acquisition, heart failure, or dilution by non-contrasted blood from the inferior vena cava. As a consequence, image quality may be substantially decreased, and the CT images may be non-diagnostic with regard to PE. Potential improvement of arterial opacification can be achieved, for example, by a higher injection rate or a higher concentration, ie, a higher dose of contrast agent . However, an increase in contrast agent arises the risks of contrast medium-induced nephropathy and acute renal failure, respectively .
