## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the prognostic significance of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography in patients with stage IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who underwent surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, focused on the relationship between SUVmax values and tumor histology.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the initial SUVmax of 205 patients (112 adenocarcinomas, 82 squamous cell carcinomas \[SCCs\], and 11 of other histology) with a stage IIIA NSCLC who underwent surgical resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and who were followed for up to 6 years. Clinical data, including histologic type, pathologic response, and treatment, were reviewed, and the relationship between the SUVmax and patient overall survival was examined.

## Results

Overall, the 2-year survival rate was 68%. Between the two histologic subtypes of adenocarcinoma and SCC, we noted significant differences in all variables of gender (male predominance in SCC), initial SUVmax (greater in SCC), pathologic response (more complete remission in SCC), and overall survival (better in SCC) (all _P_ values, < .05). SUVmax remained as a sole independent factor for survival in multivariate analysis in whole series (SUVmax cutoff, 13; median survival, 3.0 years vs. 4.0 years; _P_ = .016) and in adenocarcinomas (SUVmax cutoff, 11.5; median survival, 2.6 years vs. 3.6 years; _P_ = .045), but not in SCCs.

## Conclusion

The initial SUVmax is a sole significant prognostic factor in patients with a surgically resected NSCLC after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, particularly in patients with an adenocarcinoma.

The effect of preoperative induction therapy (neoadjuvant therapy) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on tumor staging, surgery, and patient survival has been described in previous clinical reports . The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) has been investigated fairly extensively, and has proven effective in the prediction of patient prognosis after surgical treatment . Moreover, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by the European Lung Cancer Working Party for the work of International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer lung cancer staging project concluded that the primary SUVmax is a prognostic factor in NSCLC patients .

However, NSCLC consists of heterogeneous diseases of several histologic subtypes that may show different biological behaviors and levels of clinical aggressiveness . Although measuring the SUVmax of a primary lung cancer at PET-CT has already been proven effective in predicting prognosis, there remain many unresolved questions associated with the use of SUVmax as a prognostic marker, particularly with regard to the optimal threshold value for prognostic determination and its relationship with the different histologic subtypes of NSCLC . For these reasons, more accurate and widely applicable biologic surrogate markers may be required to identify patients with locally advanced NSCLC who might still benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.
