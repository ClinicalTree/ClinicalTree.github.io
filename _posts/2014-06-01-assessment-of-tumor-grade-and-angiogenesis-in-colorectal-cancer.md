## Rationale and Objectives

The preoperative evaluation of tumor grading and angiogenesis has important clinical implications in the treatment and prognosis of patients with colorectal cancers (CRCs). The aim of the present study was to assess tumor perfusion with 256-slice computed tomography (CT) using whole-volume perfusion technology before surgery, and to investigate the differences in the perfusion parameters among tumor grades and the correlation between perfusion parameters and pathologic results in CRC.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-seven patients with CRC confirmed by endoscopic pathology underwent whole-volume perfusion CT assessments with a 256-slice CT and surgery. Quantitative values for blood flow, blood volume, and time to peak were determined using commercial software. After surgery, resected specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically with CD105 antibodies for the quantification of microvessel density (MVD). The difference in CT perfusion parameters and MVD among different tumor differentiation grades was evaluated by the Student–Newman–Keuls test. The correlations between CT perfusion parameters and MVD were evaluated using the Pearson correlation analysis.

## Results

The mean blood flow was significantly different among well, moderately, and poorly differentiated groups (61.17 ± 17.97, 34.80 ± 13.06, and 22.24 ± 9.31 mL/minute/100 g, respectively; _P_ < .05). The blood volume in the well-differentiated group was significantly higher than that in the moderately differentiated group (33.96 ± 24.81 vs. 16.93 ± 5.73 mL/100 g; _P_ = .002) and that in the poorly differentiated group (33.96 ± 24.81 vs. 18.05 ± 6.01 mL/100 g; _P_ = .009). The time to peak in the poorly differentiated group was significantly longer than that in the well-differentiated group (27.81 ± 11.95 vs. 17.60 ± 8.53 seconds; _P_ = .016) and that in the moderately differentiated group (27.81 ± 11.95 vs. 18.94 ± 7.47 seconds; _P_ = .028). There was no significant difference in the MVD among well, moderately, and poorly differentiated groups (33.47 ± 14.69, 28.89 ± 11.82, and 29.89 ± 11.02, respectively; _P_ > .05). There was no significant correlation between CT perfusion parameters and MVD ( _r_ = 0.201, 0.295, and −0.178, respectively; _P_ = .233, .076, and .292, respectively).

## Conclusions

CT whole-volume perfusion technology has the potential to evaluate pathologic differentiation grade of CRC before surgery. However, preoperative perfusion CT parameters do not reflect the MVD of CRC.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the fourth most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide . The 5-year survival rate depends on the tumor stage and grade at patient presentation. Tumors with an advanced stage and grade at diagnosis are associated with a poor outcome. Individual treatment strategy based on tumor stage and grade should be applied to improve the prognosis. Thus, the preoperative diagnostic evaluation and grading of CRC are important . Preoperative specimens from endoscopic colorectal biopsies are often used but are normally failed to grade tumor because of the lack of sufficient tissue . Angiogenesis, which is important in the growth and metastasis of carcinomas, has been reported to be a promising prognostic marker for the CRC . Microvessel density (MVD) count is used to define the degree of angiogenesis in solid tumors for diagnostic purpose and treatment planning, which is calculated by counting the number of angiogenic blood vessels highlighted on a variety of immunohistochemical stains . However, information pertaining to the MVD can only be gathered in the in vitro setting after the resection of the tumor, and therefore there is no opportunity to evaluate the effect of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy on this parameter.

Perfusion computed tomography (CT) can quantify tumor angiogenesis noninvasively by assessing the enhancement of the tissue and vessels over time. Perfusion parameters, including tissue blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), time to peak (TTP), and permeability–surface area product (PS), are calculated using the mathematical models for contrast agent exchange . Goh et al. reported the relationship between CT perfusion parameters and MVD counts and their data indicated a positive correlation between tumor PS and BV with MVD in CRC, inconsistent with the report by Li et al. , which showed no significant correlation between any perfusion parameters with MVD. Both the studies were based on the deconvolution approach, but the scanning equipments, scanning modes, analytical software were different, which might be the potential explanation for such differences and make the standardization of the technique difficult . Romani et al. reported that CD105 (endoglin)-staining intensities in CRCs were correlated with the MVD levels and were better indicators of the state of tumor angiogenesis. Previous CRC CT perfusion studies usually use one slice or a few slices of the tumor to represent the overall tumor angiogenesis state, and to some degree, this sampling rate is not sufficient because of the heterogeneity of tumor angiogenesis. Additionally, the lesion on CT images is not exactly the same as the pathologic specimen in the orientation, shape, and size, which makes it difficult to achieve precise alignment. Therefore, we analyzed primary CRC using whole-volume perfusion CT measurements and assessed whether perfusion CT could be used to evaluate the pathologic grade and the correlation between perfusion parameters and MVD stained with CD105 in CRC.
