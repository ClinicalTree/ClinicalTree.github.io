## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively evaluate the diagnostic performance of texture analysis (TA) for the discrimination of angiomyolipoma (AML) with minimal fat, clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), and papillary renal cell cancer (pRCC) on computed tomography (CT) images and to determine the scanning phase, which contains the strongest discriminative power.

## Materials and Methods

Patients with pathologically proved AMLs ( _n_ = 18) lacking visible macroscopic fat at CT and patients with pathologically proved ccRCCs ( _n_ = 18) and pRCCs ( _n_ = 14) were included. All patients underwent CT scan with three phases (precontrast phase \[PCP\], corticomedullary phase \[CMP\], and nephrographic phase \[NP\]). The selected images were analyzed and classified with TA software (MaZda). Texture classification was performed for 1) minimal fat AML versus ccRCC, 2) minimal fat AML versus pRCC, and 3) ccRCC versus pRCC. The classification results were arbitrarily divided into several levels according to the misclassification rates: excellent (misclassification rates ≤10%), good (10%< misclassification rates ≤20%), moderate (20%< misclassification rates ≤30%), fair (30%< misclassification rates ≤40%), and poor (misclassification rates ≥40%).

## Results

Excellent classification results (error of 0.00%–9.30%) were obtained with nonlinear discriminant analysis for all the three groups, no matter which phase was used. On comparison of the three scanning phases, we observed a trend toward better lesion classification with PCP for minimal fat AML versus ccRCC, CMP, and NP images for ccRCC versus pRCC and found similar discriminative power for minimal fat AML versus pRCC.

## Conclusions

TA might be a reliable quantitative method for the discrimination of minimal fat AML, ccRCC, and pRCC.

Angiomyolipoma (AML) as the most common benign solid renal tumor is not difficult to be diagnosed when macroscopic fat is appeared, but diagnosis is challenging for AML with minimal fat . Approximately 10%–17% of benign renal tumors are surgically resected , and AMLs account for 18%–59% of the excised benign tumors . In this regard, accurate differential diagnosis of minimal fat AML from renal cell cancer (RCC) is crucial to avoid unnecessary surgery.

In previous studies, investigators have described some imaging features that are highly suggestive of minimal fat AML, such as high attenuation at unenhanced computed tomography (CT) with homogeneous prolonged enhancement , a small renal mass with homogeneous low signal intensity (SI) on T2-weighted images , and the presence of microscopic fat at in- and opposed-phase images ; however, imaging characteristics can be variable while clear cell RCC (ccRCC) often contains microscopic fat with decreasing SI on opposed-phase images compared to in-phase images ; papillary RCC (pRCC) often shows low T2 SI and homogeneous and gradual enhancement at CT or magnetic resonance (MR) images . In a word, there are no reliable imaging features to differentiate minimal fat AML from RCC.
