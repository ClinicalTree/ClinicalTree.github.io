## Rationale and Objectives

The hyperpolarized  3 He long-range diffusion coefficient (LRDC) in lungs is sensitive to changes in lung structure due to emphysema, reflecting the increase in collateral paths resulting from tissue destruction. However, no clear understanding of LRDC in healthy lungs has emerged. Here we compare LRDC measured in healthy lungs with computer simulations of diffusion along the airway tree with no collateral connections.

## Materials and Methods

Computer simulations of diffusion of spatially modulated spin magnetization were performed in computer-generated, symmetric-branching models of lungs and compared with existing LRDC measurements in canine and human lungs.

## Results

The simulations predict LRDC values of order 0.001 cm  2 /sec, approximately 20 times smaller than the measured LRDC. We consider and rule out possible mechanisms for LRDC not included in the simulations: incomplete breath hold, cardiac motion, and passage of dissolved  3 He through airway walls. However, a very low density of small (micron) holes in the airways is shown to account for the observed LRDC.

## Conclusion

It is proposed that LRDC in healthy lungs is determined by small collateral pathways.

The advent of technology for the production of approximately liter quantities of hyperpolarized  3 He gas allows imaging of the air spaces of lungs. The first use of the technology was to produce ventilation images ( ) that display the distribution of a single bolus of inhaled  3 He at breath hold. Subsequently, dynamic  3 He MRI was used to show the time evolution of gas distribution, with sub-second time resolution ( ). A quantitative method for measurement of the local fractional ventilation (the fraction of gas replaced with each breath) has also appeared ( ). The local oxygen concentration and its decrease during breath hold have been determined ( ) from the  3 He T  1 , allowing the local ventilation–perfusion ratio to be calculated ( ).

The microstructure of the lung (the acinar airways and alveolar walls) _restricts_ the diffusion of  3 He. In emphysema, expansion of the acinar airways and tissue destruction result in less restriction and larger apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Measurements of the ADC are commonly performed ( ) with two b-values, one of which is zero, with bipolar diffusion-sensitizing gradient pulses of 2- to 5-millisecond duration (here b is the weighting of the diffusion-sensitizing gradient pulses). For these times, the  3 He free diffusivity D  0 (in N  2 or air) of about 0.88 cm  2 /sec corresponds to RMS displacements of about 0.7 mm, large enough to thoroughly explore the interior of a typical acinar airway. Measured ADC values in normal human lungs are approximately 0.2 cm  2 /sec and increase in emphysema; in severely diseased lungs, 0.6 cm  2 /sec is common ( ). Likewise, increases of ADC in rats are observed in emphysema ( ).  3 He ADC measurements have yet to enter common clinical practice, though they are regarded as the emerging new gold standard for characterizing the emphysema-component of COPD. Interest is high in using  3 He ADC for early detection of the disease and for following disease progression in drug treatment trials.

and k = 2π/λ. The relevant diffusion distance is of order λ/2. The LRDC can also be measured with stimulated echo methods ( ). The underlying physics is the same as the spatially modulated magnetization method, with the initial spin position encoded in the longitudinal magnetization. The primary difference between the methods is whether the modulation is done in the imaging plane or perpendicular to it. The stimulated echo method allows a wide range of modulation wavelengths and diffusion times to be explored ( ).

This result is correct when the LRDC so determined is much smaller than the gas free diffusion, D  0 . Using the above values of D  W and _s_ and setting L = 600 μm and _x_ = 6 μm, reasonable estimates for acinar airways ( ), we obtain LRDC = 10  −4 cm  2 /sec. This is _much_ smaller than the observed values of LRDC and even much smaller than the computer simulated results. We note that the gas-phase diffusivity is not infinite, which will make the overall diffusivity LRDC only (slightly) smaller. In the same way, lack of equilibrium of the concentration at the gas-liquid surfaces will also reduce LRDC. Overall, the diffusion through the structure of  Figure 3 can be regarded as several processes in series, so the overall diffusivity is no larger than the result of Equation  6 . We conclude that this mechanism is negligible, as a result of the low solubility of  3 He in water and its slow diffusion in water. We note that Equation  6 was derived using a linear concentration (or spin magnetization) variation along _x_ , but the result is fully general for length scales longer than L.

here, D  0 is the free diffusivity of the gas. This result, aside from the numerical factor (which is only approximate), can be obtained by dimensional analysis.

This result is obtainable from the electrostatic capacitance CA of a conducting disk relative to a (grounded) surrounding conductor at infinity. The result is given by Smythe ( ) as CA = 8ε  0 r, where ε  0 is the permittivity of free space. Thus, the capacitance to top or bottom alone is 4ε  0 r; the electrostatic and electrical conduction equations are analogous upon substituting the electrostatic ε  0 for the electrical conductivity σ. We note that the two electrical conductances of 4σr in series form a single, net conductance of 2σr. In terms of diffusion, the diffusive conductance of the hole is therefore correctly given by

which differs numerically only slightly from the simple estimate of Equation  7 . This result has been confirmed by numerical solution of ∇  2 c = 0. The result also appears in Berg ( ).
