## Rationale and Objectives

Intra-procedural measurement of hepatic perfusion following liver embolization continues to be a challenge. Blood volume imaging before and after interventional procedures would allow identifying the treatment end point or even allow predicting treatment outcome. Recent liver oncology studies showed the feasibility of parenchymal blood volume (PBV) imaging using an angiographic C-arm system. This study was done to evaluate the reproducibility of PBV measurements using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) before and after embolization of the liver in a swine model.

## Materials and Methods

CBCT imaging was performed before and after partial bland embolization of the left lobe of the liver in five adult pigs. Intra-arterial injection of iodinated contrast with a 6-second x-ray delay was used with a two-sweep 8-second rotation imaging protocol. Three acquisitions, each separated by 10 minutes to allow for contrast clearance, were obtained before and after embolization in each animal. Post-processing was carried out using dedicated software to generate three-dimensional (3D) PBV maps. Two region-of-interest measurements were placed on two views within the right and left lobe on each CBCT 3D PBV map. Variation in PBV for scans acquired within each animal was determined by the coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test post-procedure reduction in PBV.

## Results

The CBCT PBV maps showed mean coefficients of variation of 7% (range: 2%–16%) and 25% (range:  13%–34%) for baseline and embolized PBV maps, respectively. The intraclass correlation for PBV measurements was 0.89, demonstrating high reproducibility, with measurable reduction in PBV displayed after embolization ( _P_ = 0.007).

## Conclusions

Intra-procedural acquisition of 3D PBV maps before and after liver embolization using CBCT is highly reproducible and shows promising application for obtaining intra-procedural PBV maps during locoregional therapy.

## Introduction

Objective measurement of hepatic perfusion during locoregional treatment could aid in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although hepatic blood circulation is approximately 25% arterial and 75% portal venous in the healthy liver , the onset of neoangiogenesis in HCC leads to the domination of arterial supply to the tumor . For patients with underlying cirrhosis, the degree of arterialization reflects the stage , with dysplastic nodules and early HCC demonstrating some portal flow, but as HCC progresses the supply to the tumor rapidly morphs into exclusively arterial supply . In vivo assessment of organ perfusion, including measurement of blood volume contribution from the hepatic arterial and portal flow, is an established and reproducible technique using dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) . Specifically, pathologic changes during neoangiogenesis, the evolution from dysplasia to poorly differentiated HCC, and changes following transarterial chemoembolization have been studied by dynamic contrast-enhanced CT . Assessment of tumor characteristics during locoregional treatments, vis-à-vis quantitative hemodynamic characteristics, may offer a valuable diagnostic or treatment end point biomarker . Intra-procedural dynamic contrast-enhanced CT at the present time is infeasible. In contrast, the use of cone beam CT (CBCT) or C-arm CT as a complementary modality to digital subtraction angiography (DSA) during therapy is widely accepted and continues to become a routine part of the procedure . Moreover, within the past few years, a modified injection and reconstruction protocol designed for CBCT imaging has demonstrated the feasibility of calculating cerebral perfusion in canines and humans . Using a similar approach, it was shown that a modified injection and reconstruction protocol enables the calculation of parenchymal blood volume (PBV) within the liver using CBCT . These first clinical studies show the feasibility of PBV measurements before and after hepatic arterial treatment with its correlation to CT perfusion studies. However, up to now, no study has carefully evaluated the reproducibility of PBV measurements in the liver for one subject. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of obtaining PBV measurements in a swine model using CBCT, before and after partial transarterial (bland) embolization of the liver.

## Materials and Methods

Under approval by the Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care, five female adult Yorkshire breed pigs (53 ± 0.9 kg) underwent CBCT imaging of the liver before and after partial particle embolization of the left lobe. During the duration of the experiments, animals were under the attendance of two licensed veterinary technicians. Prior to imaging, the animals were given intramuscular injection of Telazol (Fort Dodge Animal Health, KS) (5–7 mg/kg) combined with atropine (0.5 mg/kg). Following intubation, isoflurane was maintained at 1%–2% by mechanical ventilation. Assessment of vital signs, including heart rate, O  2 saturation, and end tidal CO  2 , was performed every 15 minutes. Primary dosage of 300 IU/kg of heparin was given intra-arterially and supplemented as needed. Directly prior to imaging procedures, a 7Fr sheath (Vanguard; Medrad, Indianola, PA) was placed within the right common femoral artery. Following an aortogram, a standard 5Fr end-hole catheter (AngioDynamics, Latham, NY) was placed in the common hepatic artery under fluoroscopic guidance. All pre-embolization and post-embolization imaging was performed following injection of iodinated contrast into the common hepatic artery using a dual-syringe power injector (MEDTRON Accutron HP-D, Saarbrücken, Germany). CBCT acquisition details are described later. A 2.3Fr microcatheter (Renegade HI-FLO; Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was advanced through the 5Fr catheter, with the tip positioned in the left hepatic artery, under fluoroscopic guidance. The embolization to near stasis was performed by injecting 150–300 micron diameter microspheres (Embospheres; Merit Medical Systems, Inc, South Jordan, UT) to parts of the left lobe of the liver and was confirmed using DSA.
