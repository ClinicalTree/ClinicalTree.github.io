## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of a self-expanding metal stent seeded with autologous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) for preventing in-stent stenoses in transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in a swine model.

## Materials and Methods

TIPS was performed in 18 young adult pigs, using a self-expanding nitinol stent (control, _n_ = 8) and an autologous EPC-seeded stent (treatment, _n_ = 10). All pigs were sacrificed at 2 weeks post-TIPS procedure. Portography was performed immediately before the euthanasia. Gross, microscopic, and immunohistochemistry of the TIPS tract specimens were examined. The proliferative response of the shunt was quantified histologically.

## Results

TIPS was performed successfully in 16 swine, 2 animals died during the procedure. Another pig died of unknown causes 2 days post-procedure. At day 14 follow-up, portography and necropsy of the 15 remaining swine demonstrated that five shunts occluded and one shunt was stenotic (80%) in the control group ( _n_ = 6). Five shunts remained patent, two shunts were stenosed (50%, 70%), and the remaining two shunts were occluded in the treatment group ( _n_ = 9). The patency rate was significantly lower in the control group than in the treatment group, 0% versus 55.6% ( _P_ = .03). Histological analyses showed a significantly greater pseudointimal hyperplasia in the TIPS track of the control group than that of the treatment group ( _P_ < .05). Intact endothelium was documented in the lumina of all the EPC-implanted stent group.

## Conclusions

The EPC-seeded metal stent is feasibly fabricated in vitro and improves the patency in TIPS in a porcine model.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) has been in use for more than 20 years to treat recurrent variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites caused by portal hypertension . However, shunt stenosis or occlusion remains a major obstacle to the utility of TIPS . Several investigators have suggested that bile leakage is inevitable during a TIPS procedure and there may be small bile ducts in communication with the TIPS tract that may account for the neointimal overgrowth . Bile leak inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation instead of promoting their growth in an _in vitro_ cell culture, and further study shows that such bile leakage may promote in-stent stenosis in a TIPS shunt by inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation . Using a physical barrier to block bile and cytokine leakage between the circulation and the injured hepatic parenchyma has been shown to prevent in-stent stenosis of TIPS . Another potential method to prevent in-stent stenosis is the induction of rapid endogenous reendothelialization of the tract to inhibit the bile leakage that is associated with early stage thrombosis and late stage pseudointimal overgrowth within a TIPS shunt . The design of an autologous endothelialized stent graft to prevent post-TIPS in-stent stenosis holds great promise. Although Zhuang showed that the TIPS shunt patency improves significantly at 2 weeks in a swine model with an autologous vein-covered stent, such a technique does not seem practical in routine clinical use.

It is known that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can differentiate into endothelial cells _in vivo_ and can easily be harvested from peripheral blood . In this study, we designed a novel endoprosthesis for TIPS that was seeded with autologous EPCs to test that the shunt patency would be improved with this device when compared with a bare metal self-expanding stent.
