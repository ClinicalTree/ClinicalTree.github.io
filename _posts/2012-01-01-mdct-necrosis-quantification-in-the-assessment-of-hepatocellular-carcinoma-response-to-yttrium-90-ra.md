## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the reproducibility and agreement of tumor necrosis quantification performed by two-dimensional and volumetric methods in a cohort of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treated with yttrium-90 (  90 Y) radioembolization.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine consecutive patients (21 men, 8 women; mean age 66.6 years; age range, 44–90 years) with HCC treated with  90 Y radioembolization that underwent liver multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) were included. Two independent radiologists evaluated the necrosis proportion of the lesions with two-dimensional (2D) measurements according to the European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines, and with a volumetric method using a voxel-by-voxel analysis. Interobserver reproducibility for each method was assessed by using within-subject coefficients of variation (WSCV), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Lin’s concordance correlation coefficients (LCC). Agreement between both methods was assessed by using the Bland-Altman plot and the paired _t_ -test.

## Results

The volumetric method was more reproducible (WSCV = 27.8%; ICC = 0.914; LCC = 0.909) than the 2D (WSCV = 43.8%; ICC = 0.723; LCC = 0.841). There was a significant difference in the mean calculated necrosis proportions based on 2D and volumetric methods ( _P_ = .0129).

## Conclusion

Voxel-by-voxel quantification of HCC necrosis is a more reproducible method than 2D analysis.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is potentially curable by surgical resection or transplantation , but usually only 15%–25% of the patients are candidates for surgery . Because most chemotherapeutic agents have marginal antitumoral effects , a significant portion of patients are treated with target-directed therapies, such as radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE), or yttrium-90 (  90 Y) radioembolization .

Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has been widely used for assessing tumor response after therapy . To develop a common language and standardize the response evaluation, several criteria were developed, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), and its more recent update, RECIST 1.1 . These guidelines require decrease of the tumor size as a marker for a positive response . Response to locoregional therapy, however, may not lead to a reduction in tumor volume . Indeed, with directed therapy, tumoral tissue may undergo necrosis, which may even lead to an increase in the size of the lesion . Therefore, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) has published a guideline recommending that the reduction in the amount of tumor viable tissue should be used to assess tumor response to localized treatment (where viable tissue means tumor regions that did not undergo necrosis) . Since then, the evaluation of tumor viable tissue has been increasingly used as a surrogate marker to assess response to locoregional therapies. The EASL guidelines recommend quantifying the amount of necrosis as a way to estimate the amount of viable tumor tissue. Most investigators have applied the two-dimensional (2D) measurements modified from WHO guidelines on a single axial plane to quantify necrosis . The modified RECIST proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases uses the single longest axial diameter of the necrotic area to assess response to locoregional therapy, but it has not yet been widely validated; however, a new report suggests that modified RECIST may be superior to RECIST1.1 .

A total of 10 Hounsfield units (HU) is added to the mean attenuation values obtained by placing ROIs in the unenhanced images. (c) Third step: necrosis definition. After a HU threshold is entered by the user, every pixel within the segmented tumor with attenuation equal or lesser than it is shown in red ( white star ) and its volume is quantified by the software.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MDCTNecrosisQuantificationintheAssessmentofHepatocellularCarcinomaResponsetoYttrium90RadioembolizationTherapy/1_1s20S1076633211004326.jpg)
