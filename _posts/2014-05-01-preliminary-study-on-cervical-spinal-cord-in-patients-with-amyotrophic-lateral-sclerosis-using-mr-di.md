## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the conventional magnetic resonance (MR) findings of cervical spinal cord, to explore the possible changes on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and to assess the correlations between the changes on DTI and clinical parameters in patients with ALS.

## Materials and Methods

Conventional MR imaging (MRI) and DTI in 24 patients with ALS and 16 age-matched control subjects were obtained. On axial planes, regions of interest (ROIs) were marked in bilateral spinothalamic tracts (STs), posterior funiculus, and bilateral lateral corticospinal tracts (LCTs), respectively, at the levels of cervical 2–4 vertebral bodies. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of these ROIs were estimated. Independent sample _t_ test and Pearson correlation analysis were used.

## Results

In patients with ALS, no abnormal findings were noted in the cervical spinal cord on conventional MRI. FA values of bilateral LCTs decreased significantly compared to those of the control group ( _P_ < .05), and ADC values of bilateral LCTs were significantly greater than those of the control group ( _P_ < .05). FA and ADC values of bilateral LCTs showed no significant difference between patients with definite and probable ALS ( _P_ > .05). No significant correlation existed between abnormal DTI parameters (FA and ADC values of bilateral LCTs) and clinical parameters ( _P_ > .05).

## Conclusions

Subtle abnormalities in bilateral LCTs in the “normal-appearing” cervical spinal cord can be detected using quantitative DTI technique in patients with ALS.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by spinal and cortical motor neuron degeneration. It targets both upper and lower motor neurons . The main histologic changes of ALS include loss of motor neurons and associated astrocytosis . Electromyography, muscle biopsy, and motor unit number estimation are useful for the evaluation of lower motor neuron damage, but there is at present no objective and quantitative radiologic technique in detecting upper motor neuron damage , especially in spinal cord. Although the prognosis of this disease is relatively poor, early application of drug therapy could slow down the disease progression in some patients with ALS, so early detection of subtle injuries and assessment of the disease process are of great importance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to investigate the involvement of the corticospinal tracts (CSTs) in brain parenchyma in patients with ALS, and abnormal high signal intensities along CST have been observed on T2-weighted image (T2WI) because of degeneration and demyelination . Theoretically, bilateral lateral corticospinal tracts (LCTs) of the spinal cord, as the extension of CSTs, should also be involved in ALS. Do the LCTs also show abnormal signals on conventional MRI in patients with ALS? If not, can we detect the possible pathologic changes in LCTs using other MR related techniques?
