High-resolution computed tomography is a necessary tool used in the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. The interpretation of high-resolution computed tomography can be difficult given the wide spectrum of imaging appearances within the same disease and among different diseases. The authors provide a new educational method to learn about the spectrum of idiopathic interstitial lung disease through the use of a free online digital atlas and review article. This atlas can be downloaded at  http://www.seattlechildrens.org/radiologyeducation/ILD .

High-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) imaging is an important diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of patients presenting with dyspnea and suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD) . The various idiopathic ILDs often present with similar clinical symptomatology, physical examination findings, and restrictive lung physiology. Knowledge and understanding of the various imaging presentations of disease is imperative to arrive at the correct diagnosis and guide patient management and eventual therapy. A printed HRCT atlas for lung diseases has been published but may be limited by the inconvenience of referring to multiple pages, the exclusion of certain levels of the lung, and the inability to compare images of the spectrum of disease and different ILDs side by side. This article and digital atlas focus on idiopathic ILDs and do not include other causes of diffuse parenchymal lung disease, such as sarcoidosis, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, as discussed in the consensus statement of the American Thoracic Society .

We present an interactive HRCT atlas of idiopathic ILD acquired in lung windows, with a brief review of the six core ILDs. Particular attention is paid to disease distribution and specific radiologic findings. The atlas was created to allow a more rapid assessment and comparison of the spectrum of imaging appearances within and across specific subtypes of ILD. This product will be especially useful for educating residents, practicing radiologists, medical students, and pulmonologists on the HRCT signs and patterns unique to different ILDs. Instructions for installation appear in  Appendix A . A tutorial for use appears in  Appendix B . Both of these appendices are available for download at  http://www.academicradiology.org .

## Materials and methods

## Image Acquisition and Disease Selection

All HRCT examinations were performed from 2000 through 2010 on a 16-slice or 64-slice scanner. Most studies were performed using a standard HRCT protocol. Axial sections were acquired at 0.625-mm collimation in deep suspended inspiration and reconstructed at 1.5 mm. Images were displayed at a window width of 1000 to 1600 and a mean of −600 to −700. The field of view was approximately 35 cm. Images for the digital atlas were taken at 16 proximate predetermined levels from the inspiratory examination. Prone and expiratory images were not used for the atlas but are referred to in the comments when appropriate.

Cases included are those determined to have one of six idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), organizing pneumonia, the smoking-related ILDs (respiratory bronchiolitis \[RB\], RB-ILD, and desquamative interstitial pneumonia \[DIP\]), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), and acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP). Determination of disease was made by clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlation. Pathologic confirmation occurred in approximately 70% of cases (33 of 47). Pathologic sampling was obtained from the most predictable area of disease as seen on computed tomography. Thoracic surgery performed the biopsies using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or wedge resection unless otherwise specified. When pathologic correlation was not available (approximately 30% of cases), radiologic and clinical determination were used. A total of 48 cases were included in the atlas, including one normal example. Original axial images were saved in Joint Photographic Experts Group image format and were cropped and reoriented, as needed, using Microsoft Office Picture Manager (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Axial images were oriented in standard fashion.

## Digital Atlas Program

The program used to run the atlas of images is written in C# (Microsoft Corporation) and was previously described .
