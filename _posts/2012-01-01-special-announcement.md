I am delighted to announce that Richard Gunderman M.D., PhD will become the new Executive Deputy Editor for Education for _Academic Radiology_ as of January 1, 2012.

Richard is presently Professor of Radiology and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiology at the Indiana School of Medicine. He also has secondary appointments in Pediatrics, Medical Education, and Philosophy. He has a great interest in Radiology Education and has published extensively on the subject. He is no stranger to the AUR and serves on the AUR Board of Directors, Development Committee and is Program Chair of the Philips Academic Faculty Development Program.

The mission of _Academic Radiology_ is to publish high quality peer reviewed manuscripts in the areas of imaging science, clinical care and radiologic education. At the last meeting of the AUR Board of Directors there was a discussion about how to increase the submission of high quality education manuscripts and I agreed that this should be an important priority for our journal. Dr. Gunderman was selected by our search committee and we are fortunate that he has agreed to serve in this important position.

Specific expectations of the new Executive Deputy Editor for Education will be to:

- 1.
Actively identify presentations from the annual AUR meeting suitable for transformation into articles in Academic Radiology, solicit authors, and assist with submission.

- 2.
Write a monthly “Educational Perspectives” column for non-research and tutorial articles about education.
