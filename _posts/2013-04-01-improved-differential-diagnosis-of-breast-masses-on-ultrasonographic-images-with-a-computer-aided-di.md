## Objectives

A computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme for determining histological classifications of breast masses is expected to be useful for clinicians in making a differential diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of using the CAD scheme on ultrasonographic images.

## Methods

The database consisted of 390 breast ultrasonographic images with masses. Three experienced clinicians independently provided subjective ratings on the likelihood of malignancy for each of the 390 masses. Fifty benign masses (25 cysts and 25 fibroadenomas) and 50 malignant masses (25 noninvasive ductal carcinomas and 25 invasive ductal carcinomas) were selected as unknown cases for an observer study based on a stratified randomization method with the ratings. The likelihood of the histological classification in each unknown case was evaluated by the CAD scheme with image features that clinicians commonly use for describing masses. In the observer study, seven observers provided their confidence levels regarding the malignancy of the unknown case before and after viewing the likelihood of the histological classification. The usefulness of the CAD scheme was evaluated with a multireader multicase receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

## Results

The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) for all observers were improved by use of the CAD scheme. The average AUC increased from 0.716 without to 0.864 with the CAD scheme ( _P_ = .006).

## Conclusion

The presentation of the likelihood of the histological classification evaluated by the CAD scheme improved the clinicians' performance and therefore would be useful in making a differential diagnosis of masses on ultrasonographic images.

Breast ultrasonography is thought to be more useful than mammography for detecting small breast cancers in dense breasts . However, introducing ultrasonography to breast cancer screening might result in a lower specificity and thereby increase the false positive rate . Tohno et al showed the rate of positive findings by ultrasonography to be 24%, and that it would decrease to 10% if simple cysts would be excluded from the positive findings . Therefore, ultrasonography may be able to achieve more effective breast cancer screening than mammography if clinicians can more accurately make a differential diagnosis on ultrasonographic images.

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is one of the solutions for improving clinicians' performance . CAD is a diagnostic method in which clinicians use the results analyzed by a computer as a “second opinion.” The usefulness of CAD at mammography has been shown on many studies. Jiang et al conducted observer studies for distinguishing between benign and malignant clustered microcalcifications with and without the computer output indicating the likelihood of malignancy. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was thus found to increase from 0.61 to 0.75 by the computer aid ( _P_ < .0001) . Timps et al showed the radiologists' performances to improve significantly ( _P_ < .05) when they used the computer output for the characterization of benign and malignant masses on mammograms using a temporal change analysis . Nakayama et al investigated the effect of presenting similar images on radiologists' differential diagnosis of clustered microcalcifications on mammograms . The observer study found that the radiologists' performance significantly increased with the use of similar images ( _P_ = .0009).
