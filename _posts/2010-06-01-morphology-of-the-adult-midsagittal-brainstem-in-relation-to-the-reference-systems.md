## Rationale and Objectives

Anterior/posterior commissure reference system (AC/PC reference system) and the fastigium/ventricular floor plane reference system (FFL/VFL reference system) are two reference systems used in the stereotactic localization of the invisible nuclei of the brainstem in magnetic resonance (MR) images. This study investigated the variation of the midsagittal brainstem in relation to the AC/PC and VFL/FFL reference systems with respect to age and gender.

## Materials and Methods

High-resolution T1-weighted structural MR images were acquired from 64 adults (age range 21–60 years, 32 males and 32 females). The AC/PC and VFL/FFL reference systems were identified automatically. A set of landmarks of the midsagittal brainstem were defined and localized interactively.

## Results

Results illustrated that there was significant difference between the variance of the anteroposterior coordinate of the landmarks in relation to the AC/PC reference system and that in relation to the FFL/VFL reference system ( _P_ < .05), the former is larger than the latter. The positions of the landmarks in the females are more anterior than those in the males in relation to the AC/PC reference ( _P_ < .05); the difference in relation to the FFL/VFL reference system was not found.

## Conclusion

Either the FFL/VFL reference system or the AC/PC reference system has its own advantage in the stereotactic localization of the structure in the brainstem.

The brainstem comprises mesencephalon, pons, and medulla , which play crucial roles in regulating cardiac, respiratory, and central nervous system function and maintaining consciousness. However, because of the deep location and invisibility of some nuclei in the brainstem in common neuroimages, the brainstem has always been considered a dangerous stereotactic field. Indeed, the safe approach to most of the brainstem targets is still a major challenge even for the skilled neurosurgeons . Neurosurgeons always consult a reference system when locating the invisible nuclei.

Currently, there are two reference systems are used in the stereotactic field: the anterior/posterior commissure (AC/PC) reference system and the fastigium/ventricular floor plane (FFL/VFL) reference system. The AC/PC and FFL/VFL reference systems are derived from two stereotactic atlases: the Talairach and Afshar , respectively.  Figure 1 shows the definitions of these two reference systems on the midsagittal plane (MSP): the AC/PC reference system based on AC and PC, and the FFL/VFL reference system based on the fastigial point (F) of the fourth ventricle and the VFL. Their spatial relationship was analyzed using x-ray images by Hitchcock et al . Niemann et al compared imaging findings of the brainstem to Afshar's atlas, and found that the FFL in magnetic resonance (MR) images was often displaced in a more caudal location than that predicted by the atlas. These findings cast some doubt on the suitability of the FFL/VFL reference system as an appropriate landmark for stereotactic localization. Zrinzo et al reported that the anteroposterior coordinate of the caudal pole of pedunculopontine nucleus in the brainstem has a significantly greater variance in relation to the AC/PC reference system than to the VFL/FFL reference system ( _F_ -test: _P_ < .001). The study of the location in the brainstem is still undergoing. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no quantitative morphometric analysis of the brainstem in relation to these two reference systems using MR images.
