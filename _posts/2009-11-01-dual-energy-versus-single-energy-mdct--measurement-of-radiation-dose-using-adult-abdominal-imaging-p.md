## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to measure the radiation dose of dual-energy and single-energy multidetector computed tomographic (CT) imaging using adult liver, renal, and aortic imaging protocols.

## Materials and Methods

Dual-energy CT (DECT) imaging was performed on a conventional 64-detector CT scanner using a software upgrade (Volume Dual Energy) at tube voltages of 140 and 80 kVp (with tube currents of 385 and 675 mA, respectively), with a 0.8-second gantry revolution time in axial mode. Parameters for single-energy CT (SECT) imaging were a tube voltage of 140 kVp, a tube current of 385 mA, a 0.5-second gantry revolution time, helical mode, and pitch of 1.375:1. The volume CT dose index (CTDI  vol ) value displayed on the console for each scan was recorded. Organ doses were measured using metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor technology. Effective dose was calculated as the sum of 20 organ doses multiplied by a weighting factor found in International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 60. Radiation dose saving with virtual noncontrast imaging reconstruction was also determined.

## Results

The CTDI  vol values were 49.4 mGy for DECT imaging and 16.2 mGy for SECT imaging. Effective dose ranged from 22.5 to 36.4 mSv for DECT imaging and from 9.4 to 13.8 mSv for SECT imaging. Virtual noncontrast imaging reconstruction reduced the total effective dose of multiphase DECT imaging by 19% to 28%.

## Conclusion

Using the current Volume Dual Energy software, radiation doses with DECT imaging were higher than those with SECT imaging. Substantial radiation dose savings are possible with DECT imaging if virtual noncontrast imaging reconstruction replaces precontrast imaging.

Dual-energy computed tomographic (DECT) imaging is a computed tomographic (CT) imaging technique that uses two different kilovoltage energies nearly simultaneously during the same imaging session. Scanning at two different tube voltages has the potential to improve the characterization of various tissues because of the inherent changes in CT absorption parameters at different kilovoltage energies. Several applications for DECT scans in abdominal imaging are currently under investigation. DECT imaging has the potential to improve the detection of malignant liver tumors , enable the determination of urinary stone composition in vivo , and expedite the postprocessing of cardiac and abdominal CT angiography . Another potential application of DECT imaging is the capability to generate virtual noncontrast images reconstructed from postcontrast images by using iodine-subtraction techniques . Replacing the precontrast phase of a multiphase imaging protocol with a virtual noncontrast image reconstruction has the potential to reduce radiation dose effects as well as decrease imaging time.

The performance of DECT scans is currently vastly different for the various manufacturers of CT scanners . Volume Dual Energy (VDE) (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) is an investigative software package that can be added to an existing single-energy 64-detector CT scanner (LightSpeed VCT; GE Healthcare) and allow it to perform both single-energy CT (SECT) and DECT imaging without any additional hardware changes. This software enables a conventional (single-source) 64-detector CT scanner to produce two different kilovoltage energies nearly simultaneously during a single imaging acquisition. VDE works by rapidly switching between 80 and 140 kVp with each gantry rotation, while operating in axial cine mode.

Transverse, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans obtained of the liver during the late hepatic arterial phase at (A) 140 kVp and (B) 80 kVp demonstrate increased conspicuity of the tumor (curved arrow) on the 80-kVp image. This improved lesion detection comes at the cost of greater image noise at 80 kVp compared to 140 kVp. (C) Corresponding dual-energy virtual noncontrast image reconstruction. Additional transverse, contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans obtained of the liver at the level of the portal vein demonstrate decreased enhancement of the portal vein (straight arrows) and decreased image noise at (D) 140 kVp compared to (E) 80 kVp.
