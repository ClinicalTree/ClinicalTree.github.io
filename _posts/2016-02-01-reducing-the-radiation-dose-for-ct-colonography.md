## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a low-tube-voltage technique and iterative reconstruction (IR) on the radiation dose and image quality of computed tomography colonography (CTC).

## Materials and Methods

We studied 30 patients (14 women and 16 men; mean age, 64.5 ± 13.1 years; range, 39–90 years) with colorectal cancer referred for surgical treatment. All underwent CTC with fecal tagging under a standard 120-kVp protocol in the supine position and a 100-kVp protocol in the prone position. The 120-kVp images were reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP). The 100-kVp images were postprocessed using FBP and a hybrid type of IR (adaptive iterative dose reduction 3D). The effective radiation dose (ED), image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared among the three protocols. The visual image quality was scored on a four-point scale.

## Results

The mean ED was significantly lower under the 100-kVp protocol than the 120-kVp protocol, resulting in a 27% radiation dose decrease (3.5 ± 2.0 vs 2.5 ± 1.5 mSv; _P_ < .01). Image noise decreased by 48%, and the mean attenuation of tagged fluid increased from 452 to 558 HU on images acquired at 100 kVp with IR compared to that in the 120-kVp protocol; these differences were significant. The mean CNR was significantly higher under the 100 kVp with IR than the other two protocols. We found no significant differences in the visual scores for diagnostic utility between the 100 kVp with IR and the 120 kVp with FBP protocol ( _P_ = .10).

## Conclusions

Low-tube-voltage CTC reduced the radiation dose by approximately 27% while maintaining the image quality.

Computed tomography (CT) colonography (CTC) is a widely accepted screening tool for colorectal disease because of its excellent diagnostic performance and good patient tolerance . As it is useful for the preoperative evaluation of patients with colorectal carcinoma, it helps with surgical planning . It enables evaluation of the entire colon, even in patients with obstructive lesions and allows segmental localization of the tumor. CTC also facilitates the evaluation of locoregional and distant extracolonic tumor spread. However, there are concerns with respect to potential risks related to the ionizing radiation of CTC . Consequently, the radiation dose of CTC should be kept at the minimum needed for diagnostically adequate image quality. As a reduction in the radiation dose results in increased image noise and decreased image quality, it is critically important to balance the delivery of low radiation doses with the likelihood of obtaining diagnostically useful images.

Low-tube-voltage techniques yield higher contrast enhancement than the standard 120-kVp tube voltage method at lower radiation doses . However, increased image noise, a byproduct of low-tube-voltage settings, is a serious problem . Chang et al. assessed the effect of low-tube-voltage techniques on the image quality of CTC in 63 patients. They found that a decrease in the tube voltage from 120 to 100 kVp with filtered back projection (FBP) resulted in a significant decrease in the radiation dose and a decrease in the three-dimensional (3D) image quality. They suggested that the iterative reconstruction (IR) technique helped to reduce the image noise while preserving or improving the image quality at a low-tube-voltage settings for CTC.
