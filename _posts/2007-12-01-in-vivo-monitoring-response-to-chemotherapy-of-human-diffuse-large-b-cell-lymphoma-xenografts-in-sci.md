## Rationale and Objectives

A reliable noninvasive method for in vivo detection of early therapeutic response of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) patients would be of great clinical value. This study evaluates the feasibility of  1 H and  31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) for in vivo detection of response to combination chemotherapy of human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL2) xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.

## Materials and Methods

Combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, hydroxy doxorubicin, Oncovin, prednisone, and bryostatin 1 (CHOPB) was administered to tumor-bearing SCID mice weekly for up to four cycles. Spectroscopic studies were performed before the initiation of treatment and after each cycle of the CHOPB. Proton MRS for detection of lactate and total choline was performed using a selective multiple-quantum-coherence-transfer (Sel-MQC) and a spin-echo–enhanced Sel-MQC (SEE-Sel-MQC) pulse sequence, respectively. Phosphorus-31 MRS using a nonlocalized, single-pulse sequence without proton decoupling was also performed on these animals.

## Results

Significant decreases in lactate and total choline were detected in the DLCL2 tumors after one cycle of CHOPB chemotherapy. The ratio of phosphomonoesters to β-nucleoside triphosphate (PME/βNTP, measured by  31 P MRS) significantly decreased in the CHOPB-treated tumors after two cycles of CHOPB. The control tumors did not exhibit any significant changes in either of these metabolites.

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates that  1 H and  31 P MRS can detect in vivo therapeutic response of NHL tumors and that lactate and choline offer a number of advantages over PMEs as markers of early therapeutic response.

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) comprises a heterogeneous group of closely related malignancies of the lymphoid system in which the cells usually express either B-cell or T-cell markers, or both ( ). This disease results from disruption of normal development of the hematopoietic system at a precursor stage, probably because of immune deficiency, chronic inflammation, and chronic infection ( ). The incidence of NHL has been steeply rising (eg, by 3% per annum in the United States), increasing by 90% in the past 50 years ( ). An estimated 58,870 new cases of NHL are diagnosed in the United States annually. This disease ranks fifth and sixth in prevalence among cancers, and seventh and eighth as a cause of cancer death among females and males, respectively ( ); however, in terms of prevalence and numbers of cancer deaths, it affects males more than females and Caucasians more than other races. Furthermore, NHL affects the younger and middle-aged population and is the leading cause of cancer-related death among people between 20 and 40 years of age; it ranks fourth among all cancers in terms of total number of productive years lost ( ).

Only one-third of NHL cases are curable by standard chemotherapy ( ). The availability of noninvasive methods for prediction or early detection of therapeutic response of NHL tumors would be of considerable clinical value. Such methods would facilitate the rational design and individualization of therapy protocols. This would spare nonresponsive patients the unnecessary toxicity and expense of ineffective therapy and would offer them opportunities to explore more effective alternative treatment at an earlier time. However, an effective method of detecting early response of NHL tumors to the wide range of therapeutic agents available for treatment of this disease remains elusive because sensitive and specific markers of therapeutic response are still not available.
