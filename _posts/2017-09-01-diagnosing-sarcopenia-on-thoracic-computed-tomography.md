## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to assess the use of skeletal muscle mass measurements at two thoracic levels to diagnose sarcopenia on computed tomography (CT) chest examinations and to analyze the impact of these measurements on clinical outcome parameters following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

## Materials and Methods

This study retrospectively included 157 patients who underwent preoperative CT examinations. The total muscle area was measured on transverse CT images at the 3rd lumbar and 7th and 12th thoracic levels with skeletal muscle indices (SMIs) calculated at each level. SMIs were then compared to clinical outcome parameters, and thoracic cutoff values for sarcopenia at the 7th and 12th thoracic levels were calculated.

## Results

Correlation between SMIs at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) and the 12th thoracic vertebra (T12) was stronger ( _r_ = 0.724, _P_ < 0.001) than that between L3 and the seventh thoracic vertebra (T7) ( _r_ = 0.594, _P_ < 0.001). SMIs at L3 and T12 significantly correlated with prolonged length of stay. Thoracic cutoff values for the 12th thoracic level were 42.6 cm  2 /m  2 (men) and 30.6 cm  2 /m  2 (women), and those for the 7th thoracic level were 46.5 cm  2 /m  2 (men) and 32.3 cm  2 /m  2 (women).

## Conclusions

Skeletal muscle measurements at the T12 level could permit the diagnosis of sarcopenia and could be used to correlate sarcopenia with outcome parameters in patients undergoing CT limited to the chest.

## Introduction

Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and a decrease in strength . Sarcopenia is a well-documented factor causing poor clinical outcomes in surgical, oncological, and cardiovascular patients with increased infection rate, prolonged hospital stay, higher risk of falling, and decreased overall survival .

Morphologically, with increasing age, sarcopenia causes progressive atrophy of type II muscle fibers and their replacement by connective tissue and fat . Comorbidities, poor nutrition, and reduced physical activity can accelerate the development of sarcopenia . Therefore, the assessment of body composition is important in the clinical evaluation of sarcopenia.
