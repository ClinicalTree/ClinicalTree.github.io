## Rationale and Objectives

To identify the presence and extent of artifacts in prostate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and discuss tradeoffs between imaging at 1.5 T (1.5 T) and 3.0 T (3.0 T). In addition, we aim to provide quantitative estimates of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at both field strengths.

## Materials and Methods

The institutional review board waived informed consent for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant, retrospective study of 53 consecutive men who underwent 3.0 T endorectal DW-MRI and 53 consecutive men who underwent 1.5 T endorectal DW-MRI between October and December 2010. One radiologist and one physicist, blinded to patient characteristics, image acquisition parameters, and field strength, scored DW-MRI artifacts. On b = 0 images, SNR was measured as the ratio of the mean signal from a region of interest (ROI) at the level of the verumontanum (the “reference region”) to the standard deviation from the mean signal in an artifact-free ROI in the rectum.

## Results

Both readers found geometric distortion and signal graininess significantly more often at 3.0 T than at 1.5 T ( _P_ < .0001, all comparisons). Reader 2 (but not reader 1) found ghosting artifacts more often at 3.0 T ( _P_ = .001) and blurring more often at 1.5 T ( _P_ = .006). Mean SNR at the urethra (87.92 ± 27.76) at 3.0 T was 1.43 times higher than at 1.5 T (64.51 ± 14.96) ( _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

At 3.0 T (as compared to 1.5 T), increased SNR on prostate DW-MRI comes at the expense of geometric distortion and can also lead to more pronounced ghosting artifacts. Therefore, to take full advantage of the benefits of 3.0 T, further improvements in acquisition techniques are needed to address DW-MRI artifacts corresponding to higher field strengths.

Diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DW-MRI) is a promising technique that can provide both qualitative and quantitative information regarding the mobility of water molecules within tissue, can be added to existing imaging protocols without a substantial increase in the overall examination time (1–5 minutes), and does not require the administration of exogenous contrast material . Preliminary studies at both 1.5 T (T) and 3.0 T have suggested that DW-MRI may have clinical utility in the detection and management of prostate cancer. The recent trend is toward the use of 3.0 T clinical MRI scanners, under the premise of exploiting potential benefits of a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

DW-MRIs are most commonly collected using acquisition schemes based on the widely available single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (SSSE-EPI) sequence, using a pair of rectangular-shaped gradient pulses along three orthogonal axes. The “snapshot” image acquisition methodology minimizes motion artifacts, hence minimizing the need for advanced postprocessing. However, SSSE-EPI is vulnerable to susceptibility-related image artifacts, which can have a detrimental effect on image quality and can interfere with diagnostic interpretation. Susceptibility artifacts occur near the interfaces of materials of different magnetic susceptibility, such as bone–soft tissue or air-tissue interfaces, as the result of microscopic gradients or frequency shifts. The artifacts that result from these local magnetic field inhomogeneities are spatial displacements of several pixels (ie, image distortion) and/or signal dropout. It has been suggested that susceptibility artifacts can increase exponentially with field strength , and they are known to cause significant geometric image distortions, stretching, and blurring on DW-MRIs at 3.0 T . Other limitations of EPI acquisition are the relatively low spatial resolution achievable with the present hardware and the inherently long echo-train, which lead to image blurring.

![Figure 5, (a) Mesh surface displays of the average normalized signal-to-noise ratios (nSNRs) of all patients for each field strength derived from b = 0 images. Both displays demonstrate a drop in nSNR as a function of distance from the coil, with a rapid drop in SNR toward the anterior portion and edges of the prostate. Average nSNR profiles in (b) three horizontal (right-to-left, RL) planes located in the left, center and right planes and (c) two vertical (superoinferior, SI) planes located at distances of 0.55 cm and 1.65 cm from the bottom of the coil are shown. Overall, the normalized profiles are similar for the two field strengths in both the RL and SI planes. However, the normalized profile of 3.0 T images is consistently lower than that of 1.5 T images.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImageArtifactsonProstateDiffusionweightedMagneticResonanceImaging/4_1s20S107663321300216X.jpg)
