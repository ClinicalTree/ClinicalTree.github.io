Computers can calculate faster than humans as well as beat the best players at chess and Jeopardy, but can they describe a picture and explain its meaning? With the advent of the computed tomography (CT) scanner more than four decades ago, we now routinely look inside the living body for pathology. Emphysema was initially a disease that was only diagnosed at autopsy. With the use of CT scanning, we gained the technology to diagnose emphysema in the living being. It became apparent on CT that areas of low attenuation identified parenchymal destruction . The next step was to determine the cutoff value that defined emphysema on CT and correlated with the lung pathology , and then to calculate the extent and location of the disease. It is customary for radiologists to qualitatively score emphysema on a multipoint ordinal scale (ie, 0–5). Advances in imaging and software analysis have incorporated algorithms that can count the number of pixels below a specific density cutoff. Newer software programs can identify areas of low attenuation clusters to better define the extent and distribution of the disease.

However, just because we can measure something more accurately does not mean we have improved the system. As Malcolm Gladwell points out in his book _Blink_ , experts can look at an object and immediately recognize when there is something amiss . There are obvious and nuanced changes in an image or an object that cannot be calculated but are quickly “seen” by an expert. Park et al showed that visual CT scoring by radiologists was better correlated with pulmonary function tests than an automated system . Can we teach computers to see these changes?

In the current issue of _Academic Radiology_ , Gietema et al examine which factors radiologists take into account when estimating emphysema severity, and they assessed quantitative CT measurements of low attenuation areas .

This work is part of the ongoing study The Evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE). ECLIPSE is a 3-year longitudinal study . One of the goals is to identify parameters that predict disease progression specific to defined COPD subtypes .

The current work shows that quantitative analysis of how these low attenuation areas are clustered has the highest odds of predicting an increase in the visual score assigned by the radiologist. Furthermore, the type of emphysema (centrilobular or noncentrilobular), the distribution (upper, lower, or diffuse), and the radiologist’s judgment as to whether the decreased attenuation was caused by “emphysematous destruction,” or what was considered to be “small airways disease,” also predicted the severity score assigned by the radiologist.

Comparing subjective and objective measures of lung disease is not new . That the software is good at matching the emphysema scores of the radiologists or vice versa may not be as important as the fact that we are advancing from simply quantifying the extent of the disease to developing a better understanding of what radiologists look for when they diagnose emphysema (eg, clusters, the type, and the distribution of the emphysema to assign a severity score). Others have applied texture-based algorithms to CT images to improve the ability to detect and quantify emphysema . The next step will be to use all the information to determine which are best related to the disease process and to patient outcomes. Clinically, these patients present with airway obstruction, increased lung volumes, and decreased diffusing capacities. Which CT patterns will best determine the clinical prognosis ?
