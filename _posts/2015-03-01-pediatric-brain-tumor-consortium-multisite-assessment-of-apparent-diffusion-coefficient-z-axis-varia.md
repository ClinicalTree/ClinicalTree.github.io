## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance diffusion imaging can characterize physiologic characteristics of pediatric brain tumors used to assess therapy response. The purpose of this study was to assess the variability of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) along z-axis of scanners in the multicenter Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC).

## Materials and Methods

Ice–water diffusion phantoms for each PBTC site were distributed with a specific diffusion imaging protocol. The phantom was scanned four successive times to 1) confirm water in the tube reached thermal equilibrium and 2) allow for assessment of intra-examination ADC repeatability. ADC profiles across slice positions for each vendor and institution combination were characterized using linear regression modeling with a quadratic fit.

## Results

Eleven sites collected data with a high degree of compliance to the diffusion protocol for each scanner. The mean ADC value at slice position zero for vendor A was 1.123 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s, vendor B was 1.0964 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s, and vendor C was 1.110 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s. The percentage coefficient of variation across all sites was 0.309% (standard deviation = 0.322). The ADC values conformed well to a second-order polynomial along the z-axis, (ie, following a linear model pattern with quadratic fit) for vendor–institution combinations and across vendor–institution combinations as shown in the longitudinal model.

## Conclusions

Assessment of the variability of diffusion metrics is essential for establishing the validity of using these quantitative metrics in multicenter trials. The low variability in ADC values across vendors and institutions and validates the use of ADC as a quantitative tumor marker in pediatric multicenter trials.

Pediatric brain tumors are the most common type of solid tumor among children, the second most frequent childhood malignancy after leukemia, and the leading cause of death from solid tumors in this population . An estimated 4452 new cases of childhood malignant brain and central nervous system (CNS) tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2014 . Efforts to accrue sufficient numbers of patients for investigating more effective treatment strategies must hinge largely on multicenter trials, a defining feature of the National Institutes of Health–funded Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC), established in 1999. The PBTC's primary objective is to rapidly conduct novel phase I and II clinical evaluations of therapeutic drugs, new biological therapies, treatment delivery technologies, and radiation treatment strategies in children from infancy to 21 years of age with primary CNS tumors. A second objective is to characterize reliable markers and predictors (direct or surrogate) of brain tumor responses to new therapies. A third objective is to develop and coordinate innovative neuroimaging techniques. Through the PBTC's Neuroimaging Center, formed in May 2000, correlative imaging endpoints and research to evaluate new therapies are in progress .

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the leading imaging modality for evaluating a child with suspected brain tumor. It has unique multiplanar capabilities that offer detailed anatomic information with superior resolution and sensitivity. MRI is typically used for making a preoperative diagnosis and for guiding treatment planning including image-guided therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. In addition, it is used for tumor follow-up, for evaluating disease progression, and for assessing both treatment response and effects of therapy.
