_Differential Diagnosis in Pediatric Imaging_ , a collaborative effort between Rick R. van Rijn and Johan G. Blickman as well as an international group of expert authors, is an excellent reference for anyone who interprets pediatric radiologic examinations as part of his or her regular practice. The book provides a well-organized reference for differential diagnoses commonly encountered in pediatric imaging, with differentials supplemented by high-quality imaging examples. This reference is targeted toward practicing pediatric radiologists, although residents and fellows would find this book an invaluable reference to have at the workstation while interpreting pediatric studies.

The book is separated into six chapters, with the first five chapters divided using the organ-based approach commonly implemented in radiology departments. One chapter each is devoted to the thorax, mediastinum, heart, and great vessels; the abdomen and gastrointestinal tract; the urogenital tract; the skull, intracranial space, and vertebral column; and the skeleton and soft tissues. The sixth chapter is devoted to normal measurements commonly used in pediatric radiology to assess normal development. This collection of normal measurements is invaluable to pediatric imagers, giving a well-organized collection of standards that previously would require consultation with multiple different sources to obtain.

The differential diagnostic considerations for each imaging finding are provided in a tabular format, with three columns describing the diagnosis, imaging findings, and an additional column containing information useful in differentiating between diagnostic possibilities. These tables are illustrated with state-of-the-art imaging examples ranging from conventional radiography to advanced magnetic resonance techniques. Images are well chosen to demonstrate pathology, with annotated captions explaining the imaging findings and salient features of each image. The differential tables are comprehensive, with multiple common and uncommon disease processes included for consideration. In addition, an extensive discussion of imaging findings differentiating pediatric skeletal and metabolic syndromes is helpful for those radiologists who find this an overwhelming subject.

In their foreword, the authors acknowledge the importance of the Internet in the future practice of radiology, serving as a source of information and resource for sharing cases and receiving expert consultation on difficult cases. In keeping with this philosophy, each book comes with 12 months of access to RadCases, a searchable online database of 250 pediatric imaging cases. These online cases are an excellent resource for trainees as well as practicing radiologists who wish to have more exposure to pediatric imagining.

The authors hope that this book will find its way into department libraries as well as to many workstations where imaging excellence is practiced to optimally care for children. The end result is an excellent companion text for pediatric radiologists and trainees who wish to have quick access to differential diagnosis in pediatric imaging as well as an extensive reference of normal values commonly used in pediatric radiology.
