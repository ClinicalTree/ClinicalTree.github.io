## Rationale and Objectives

Conventional mammography can not distinguish between transmitted, scattered, or refracted x-rays, thus requiring breast compression to decrease tissue depth and separate overlapping structures. Diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) uses monochromatic x-rays and perfect crystal diffraction to generate images with contrast based on absorption, refraction, or scatter. Because DEI possesses inherently superior contrast mechanisms, the current study assesses the effect of breast compression on lesion characteristic visibility with DEI imaging of breast specimens.

## Materials and Methods

Eleven breast tissue specimens, containing a total of 21 regions of interest, were imaged by DEI uncompressed, half-compressed, or fully compressed. A fully compressed DEI image was displayed on a soft-copy mammography review workstation, next to a DEI image acquired with reduced compression, maintaining all other imaging parameters. Five breast imaging radiologists scored image quality metrics considering known lesion pathology, ranking their findings on a 7-point Likert scale.

## Results

When fully compressed DEI images were compared to those acquired with approximately a 25% difference in tissue thickness, there was no difference in scoring of lesion feature visibility. For fully compressed DEI images compared to those acquired with approximately a 50% difference in tissue thickness, across the five readers, there was a difference in scoring of lesion feature visibility. The scores for this difference in tissue thickness were significantly different at one rocking curve position and for benign lesion characterizations. These results should be verified in a larger study because when evaluating the radiologist scores overall, we detected a significant difference between the scores reported by the five radiologists.

## Conclusions

Reducing the need for breast compression might increase patient comfort during mammography. Our results suggest that DEI may allow a reduction in compression without substantially compromising clinical image quality.

Breast cancer imparts distinct and measurable changes in breast tissue at the cellular level. Conventional mammography attempts to detect these changes by using absorption contrast based on the spatial distribution of x-ray attenuation. This contrast mechanism requires compression of the breast between radiolucent plates to decrease x-ray path length and separate overlapping breast structures, while creating more uniform thickness for even exposure levels throughout the breast. This technique effectively reduces scatter, decreases subject radiation dose and dramatically improves image quality. The American College of Radiology suggests a maximum compression force for mammography between 25 and 40 pounds . Many women report pain associated with breast compression, potentially contributing to noncompliance with annual screening mammography recommendations for women in the United States older than age 40 .

A recent study that used Monte Carlo simulations suggested that the typical level of breast compression for digital mammography (DM) could be decreased by approximately 10% with minimal impact on image quality . However, even with maximal breast compression, absorption contrast does not always provide sufficient contrast because of minimal differences in physical and electron density between normal and cancerous tissues. The microscopic and macroscopic alterations induced by cancer in breast tissue may cause x-ray refraction, minute changes in the direction of x-ray propagation. Phase contrast imaging techniques that acquire images based on x-ray refraction contrast may have applications in breast imaging .

An intense, collimated polychromatic synchrotron x-ray beam is made monochromatic by a series of two perfect silicon crystals referred to as the monochromator. The monochromatic beam interacts with the object before becoming incident upon the third perfect crystal, referred to as the analyzer crystal. The analyzer crystal diffracts the x-ray based on its rocking curve, only reflecting x-rays that fall within a narrow acceptance window. Manipulating the angle of the analyzer crystal allows the selection of image contrast based on either absorption or refraction.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofBreastCompressiononLesionCharacteristicVisibilitywithDiffractionEnhancedImaging/0_1s20S1076633209005923.jpg)

When positioned at the ±½ W D , 50% of incident x-rays are diffracted onto the detector. Refraction above or below the plane of the incident x-ray beam will cause an increase or decrease in x-ray intensity at the detector. Maximal reflectivity occurs and excellent scatter rejection occurs at the peak rocking curve positions, and refraction of x-rays will decrease intensity regardless of the direction of refraction.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofBreastCompressiononLesionCharacteristicVisibilitywithDiffractionEnhancedImaging/1_1s20S1076633209005923.jpg)

![Figure 5, Trend in lesion perception as tissue thickness increases. The average scores reported by the radiologists were plotted as a function of the difference in tissue thickness, measured in cm. The score values could range from −3 (the fully compressed diffraction-enhanced imaging [DEI] image displays lesion feature visibility supportive of the diagnosis significantly worse than the DEI image acquired with reduced compression), to 0 (no difference between either image), to +3 (the fully compressed DEI image displays lesion feature visibility supportive of the diagnosis significantly better than the DEI image acquired with reduced compression). Linear trendlines, calculated individually for DEI absorption and DEI refraction, are shows as solid lines. Although the scores could have ranged from −3 to +3, when the scores were averaged for DEI refraction images and DEI absorption images for a specific difference in tissue thickness, these scores did not occupy the entire possible range. Moreover, the standard deviation led to some error bars that rose above the +3 maximum possible score.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofBreastCompressiononLesionCharacteristicVisibilitywithDiffractionEnhancedImaging/4_1s20S1076633209005923.jpg)
