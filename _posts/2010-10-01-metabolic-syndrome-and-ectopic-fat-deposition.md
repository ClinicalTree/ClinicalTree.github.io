## Objectives

Metabolic syndrome affects 20-30% of adults and is increasing in prevalence, making it a leading public health issue. Radiologists often encounter images of obese patients during routine studies and are in a unique position to address the importance of excess fat and need to be aware of the spectrum of pathologic consequences in different organ systems. In this review, the role of CT and MR imaging in assessment of patients with metabolic syndrome will be reviewed and the constellation of structural and functional changes in the major affected organ systems due to ectopic fatty deposition will be discussed.

## Methods

We specifically discuss the pathophysiology of metabolic syndrome, visceral versus subcutaneous obesity, cardiac lipomatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty pancreas disease, and fat deposition in other organs.

## Conclusion

Many of the multisystem manifestations of metabolic syndrome can be visualized on routine CT and MR images and radiologists can provide clinicians with important data regarding anatomic and pathologic distribution of fat in different organs. Perhaps the visualization of the fatty changes will provide tangible evidence to motivate patients to begin lifestyle modification.

Metabolic syndrome affects 20%–30% of adults and is increasing in prevalence, making it a leading public health issue. Radiologists often encounter images of obese patients during routine studies and are in a unique position to address the importance of excess fat and need to be aware of the spectrum of pathologic consequences in different organ systems. In this review, the role of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in assessment of patients with metabolic syndrome will be reviewed and the constellation of structural and functional changes in the major affected organ systems resulting from ectopic fatty deposition will be discussed.

Metabolic syndrome affects 20%–30% of adults and is increasing in prevalence, making it a leading public health issue. Metabolic syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis based on the recognition of associated metabolic conditions, which in concert greatly increases cardiovascular risk and is the primary risk contributor to 25% of newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease . Although various differing clinical criteria exist, it is generally agreed that the cluster of metabolic conditions includes obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, proinflammatory states, and prothrombotic states . The widely used clinical criteria from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP-ATPIII) requires a minimum of three of five abnormal clinical findings in reference to waist circumference, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and fasting glucose (  Fig 1 ). The NCEP-ATPIII criteria emphasizes waist circumference because abdominal or visceral obesity is central to and may explain the other components of the syndrome, and has also been found to be most predictive of cardiovascular risk .
