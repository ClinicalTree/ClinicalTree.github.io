## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to define volumetric nomograms for identifying hepatomegaly and to retrospectively evaluate the performance of radiologists in assessing hepatomegaly.

## Materials and Methods

Livers were automatically segmented from 148 abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scans: 77 normal livers and 71 cases of hepatomegaly (diagnosed by visual inspection and/or linear liver height by radiologists). Quantified liver volumes were compared to manual measurements using volume overlap and error. Liver volumes were normalized to body surface area, from which hepatomegaly nomograms were defined (H scores) by analyzing the distribution of liver sizes in the healthy population. H scores were validated against consensus reports. The performance of radiologists in diagnosing hepatomegaly was retrospectively evaluated.

## Results

The automated segmentation of livers was robust, with volume overlap and error of 96.2% and 2.2%, respectively. There were no significant differences ( _P_ \> .10) between manual and automated segmentation for either the normal or the hepatomegaly subgroup. The average volumes of normal and enlarged livers were 1.51 ± 0.25 and 2.32 ± 0.75 L, respectively. One-way analysis of variance found that body surface area ( _P_ = .004) and gender ( _P_ = .02), but not age, significantly affected normal liver volume. No significant effects were observed for two-way and three-way interactions among the three variables ( _P_ \> .18). H-score cutoffs of 0.92 and 1.08 L/m  2 were used to define mild and massive hepatomegaly (95% confidence interval, ±0.02 L/m  2 ). Using the H score as the reference standard, the sensitivity of radiologists in detecting all, mild, and massive hepatomegaly was 84.4%, 56.7%, and 100.0% at 90.1% specificity, respectively. Radiologists disagreed on 20.9% of the diagnosed cases ( _n_ = 31). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the H-score criterion for hepatomegaly detection was 0.98.

## Conclusions

Nomograms for the identification and grading of hepatomegaly from automatic volumetric liver assessment normalized to body surface area (H scores) are introduced. H scores match well with clinical interpretations for hepatomegaly and may improve hepatomegaly detection compared with height measurements or visual inspection, commonly used in current clinical practice.

Hepatomegaly is an abnormal enlargement of liver size and is inherently defined by a volumetric change. Patient size has been reported to correlate with the volume of the liver . To date, there are no defined volumetric liver nomograms to detect hepatomegaly.

Hepatic size has been an important biomarker for assessing disorders and surgical planning . Predictably, hepatic size estimates by physicians using palpation and percussion are approximate and adequate for diagnosing only cases of massive hepatomegaly . Blendis et al found that only half of enlarged livers detected by plain radiography were also identified by physical examination, while approximately half of normal livers were diagnosed as enlarged.

The H score was used as the reference standard with cutoffs of 0.92 and 1.08 L/m  2  to identify mild and massive hepatomegaly. The radiologic reports were used to compute the sensitivity and specificity of the radiologists. A cutoff of 15.5 cm was used to identify hepatomegaly using liver MHL height. Significant differences ( _P_ < .007, shown in italics) were noted between the sensitivity of the radiologist and the sensitivity of the liver MHL height criterion for the detection of massive and all cases of hepatomegaly.
