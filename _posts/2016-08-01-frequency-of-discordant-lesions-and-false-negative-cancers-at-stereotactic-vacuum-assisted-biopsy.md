## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to determine frequency of discordant lesions and discordant false-negative cancers at stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (SVAB).

## Materials and Methods

Institutional database was searched for discordant SVAB results between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012, in this retrospective institutional review board-approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. Patient age, indication for initial mammogram, breast density, lesion size, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System categorization, operator experience, biopsy needle gauge, biopsy histology, and final surgical histology of discordant lesions were collected and entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Discordant rate and false-negative rates were calculated. Fisher exact test was used to assess prevalence of discordance using 11-Gauge needles versus 9-Gauge needles. Patient age, lesion Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, operator days of experience, mammographic density, and lesion size were evaluated for association with false-negative discordant lesions using an exact Mann-Whitney _U_ test.

## Results

A total of 1861 SVABs were performed, 224 (12%) with an 11-Gauge VAB device and 1637 (88%) with a 9G Suros or Eviva device. Majority (1409 of 1861; 76%) of SVABs targeted calcifications. Twenty-three of 1861 (1.2%) discordant lesions were identified in 23 women. Seven of 23 (30%) discordant lesions were found to be cancers after final surgical pathology. Needle gauge was not associated with discordance. Operator experience was not associated with false-negative discordance.

## Conclusions

A relatively low discordance rate (1.2%) was observed. However, a high percentage (30%; range in literature 11.7%–53.8%) of our discordant lesions were false negatives. This study emphasizes the need for careful radiological-pathologic review after SVAB and for repeat biopsy or surgical excision in the setting of discordance.

## Introduction

The majority of the literature reviewing stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (SVAB) and addressing discordance arises from the late 1990s and early 2000s when SVAB was an emerging technology. Early studies served to validate the efficacy of SVAB and demonstrated that SVAB was statistically less likely to lead to radiological-pathologic discordance and undersampling compared to stereotactic core biopsy . SVAB has now become a standard tool for tissue sampling of breast lesions, particularly lesions without a sonographic correlate, most frequently calcifications.

Recognition and documentation of discordance by the radiologist after tissue sampling is a key element of SVAB and is mandated by the American College of Radiology . Discordance suggests a lesion has not been sampled adequately and therefore raises the possibility of a missed cancer.

The focal asymmetry persisted on (a) diagnostic mediolateral oblique spot compression views and (b) diagnostic craniocaudal spot compression views ( white arrows ). Targeted ultrasound was negative and stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (SVAB) (9G) recommended and performed. Postbiopsy lateral (c) and craniocaudal (d) mammograms for marker placement demonstrate the biopsy marker clip in appropriate position ( white arrows ). Biopsy pathology was benign nondiagnostic fibrofatty tissue, termed discordant by the radiologist who performed the biopsy. Wire localization and surgical excision was therefore recommended. Postlocalization mammographic specimen radiograph (e) shows the wire in good position in relation to the biopsy clip ( white arrow ). Final surgical pathology was benign fibrocystic change. The biopsy site was identified on the surgical specimen.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/FrequencyofDiscordantLesionsandFalsenegativeCancersatStereotacticVacuumassistedBiopsy/0_1s20S1076633216300265.jpg)

(d) Although calcifications were seen on the specimen radiograph ( white arrows ), relative number is scant compared to calcifications on diagnostic mammogram and at SVAB. Residual calcifications were also noted on postbiopsy mammogram ( not pictured ). SVAB yielded fibrocystic changes with benign calcifications. Pathology was thought to be discordant with imaging by the radiologist who performed the biopsy, and surgical excision was recommended and performed with final surgical pathology showing low nuclear grade ductal carcinoma in situ with associated calcifications.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/FrequencyofDiscordantLesionsandFalsenegativeCancersatStereotacticVacuumassistedBiopsy/1_1s20S1076633216300265.jpg)
