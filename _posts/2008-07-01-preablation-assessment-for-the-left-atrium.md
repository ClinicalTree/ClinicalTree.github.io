## Rationale and Objectives

Evaluate the role of two-dimensional echocardiography and electrocardiographically (ECG)-gated contrast-enhanced multislice computed tomographic (MSCT) cardiac imaging to assess cardiac anatomy, specifically pulmonary venous anatomy and left atrial thrombus, in a selected group of patients before catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation.

## Materials and Methods

Left atrial anatomy and associated findings in 34 consecutive patients scheduled for electrophysiologic testing who underwent both echocardiography and ECG-gated 16-slice MSCT cardiac imaging were retrospectively compared. Results from two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), cardiac MSCT, electrophysiologic study (EPS), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (when performed) were taken from the official medical record without prior knowledge of this study when interpretation was rendered for clinical use. Electronic record review included: presence of left atrial thrombus (defined as constant filling defect on at least two echocardiographic views or filling defect on computed tomography) and location, pulmonary venous anatomy, and other cardiac, mediastinal, or pulmonary abnormalities.

## Results

Left atrial thrombus was identified by cardiac MSCT alone in five patients (15%). Pulmonary venous variants were identified with cardiac MSCT in two patients (6%). Both MSCT and echocardiography were normal in 17 subjects (79%). Echocardiography was better at identifying associated valvular abnormalities that were seen in 10 patients (29%). Cardiac MSCT angiography alone identified other cardiac and noncardiac abnormalities, including suspicious pulmonary malignancy, mediastinal adenopathy, and coronary stenosis in 15 patients (44%).

## Conclusions

Echocardiography and cardiac MSCT angiography often provide complimentary findings during the preprocedural evaluation for patients with atrial fibrillation requiring ablation. Cardiac MSCT may provide significant additional information about the left atrium, mediastinum, coronary circulation, and visualized lung fields. Based on this study, we would advise that patients considered for radiofrequency ablation for uncontrolled right atrial fibrillation have both echocardiography and ECG-gated contrast-enhanced cardiac MSCT performed as part of the preprocedure evaluation.

Patients with atrial fibrillation nonresponsive to medical treatment are increasingly referred for electrophysiologic testing (EPS) for catheter ablation. Many of these patients are at increased risk of left atrial thrombus, even with adequate anticoagulation, putting them at risk for systemic embolism syndromes (particularly with manipulation in the left atrium). Left atrial thrombus has been evaluated by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and electron beam ultrafast (cine) computed tomography (UFCCT) of the heart ( ). The availability of TTE, anatomic detail of the cardiac chambers, and minimal side effects made TTE evaluation of the heart commonplace. However, a recent study comparing TTE with UFCCT suggested that UFCCT was better at detecting intracardiac masses and thrombus in the left atrial appendage ( ). In another study in patients with mitral valve disease or myocardial infarction, UFCCT was also deemed superior both to TTE and cardiac angiography ( ). Focus was then shifted from TTE to TEE for the detection of left atrial thrombus.

Many recent articles have substantiated the better detection of left atrial thrombus, particularly in the left atrial appendage by TEE compared to TTE ( ). A majority of these authors recommend TEE if normal findings are found on TTE during investigation of the left atrium when assessing cardiac origins of distal emboli. Variables on TTE with strong negative predictive value for findings of left atrial thrombus during subsequent TEE have been defined, and these may limit the use of TEE, albeit that TEE remains the reference method ( ).
