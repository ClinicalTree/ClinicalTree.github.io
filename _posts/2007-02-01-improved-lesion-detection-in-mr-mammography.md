## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this work was to develop a quantitative method for improving lesion detection in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography (DCEMRM). For this purpose, we segmented and analyzed suspicious regions according to their contrast enhancement dynamics, generated a normalized maximum intensity–time ratio (nMITR) projection, and explored it to extract important features, to improve accuracy and reproducibility of detection.

## Materials and Methods

A novel automated method is introduced to segment and analyze lesions in three dimensions. It consists of four consecutive stages: volume of interest selection, nMITR projection generation using a voxel sampling method based on a moving 3 × 3 mask, three-dimensional lesion segmentation, and feature extraction. The nMITR projection of the detected lesion is used to extract six features: mean, maximum, standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness, and entropy, and their diagnostic significance is studied in detail. High-resolution MR images of 52 breast masses from 46 women are analyzed using the technique developed.

## Results

Entropy, standard deviation, and the maximum and mean value features were found to have high significance ( _P_ < 0.001) and diagnostic accuracy (0.86–0.97). The kurtosis and skewness were not significant. Automated analysis of DCEMRM using nMITR was shown to be feasible.

## Conclusion

The lesion detection method described is efficient and leads to improved, accurate, reproducible diagnoses. It is reliable in terms of observer variability and may allow for a better standardization of clinical evaluations. The findings demonstrate the usefulness of nMITR based features; nMITR-entropy shows the best performance for quantitative diagnosis.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance mammography (DCEMRM) is gaining acceptance in mammographic evaluations. According to Pavic et al. ( ), only DCEMRM “has the sufficient potential for detection of lesions not seen by x-ray mammography and ultrasound, and for non-invasive characterization of breast lesions.” Although the resolution of DCEMRM is lower than that of x-ray mammography, its three-dimensional (3D) properties are invaluable in exact localization, visualization, and assessments of the aggressiveness and the multifocality of the lesions. An important advantage in favor of DCEMRM, beside absence of ionizing radiation, is that lesion-obscuring overlapping structures and summation shadows are much less pronounced in comparison with x-ray mammography because with MRM there is no need for excessive breast compression during imaging.

In DCEMRM, a contrast agent is injected and several precontrast and sequential postcontrast MR images are acquired. The concentration of the contrast agent at malignant lesions will be higher than those of the surrounding regions due to increased vascularity in these regions. Image subtraction and/or maximum intensity projection (MIP) are used to augment and detect enhancing regions. Once identified, a lesion is evaluated using various qualitative and quantitative techniques based on its morphologic and/or the enhancement properties.

Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The lesion volumes ranged from 0.07 cm  3 to 17.20 cm  3 (mean, 2.58 cm  3 ). All cases were proved either by histopathologic examination or by clinical follow-up and labeled as benign or malign. Dynamic 12-bit grayscale image sets that showed sufficient anatomical alignment were transferred from the MR scanner to a personnel computer in DICOM format for further analysis using Matlab 7.0 (The Mathworks, Inc.).

When every voxel within the VOI is covered, a 3D nMITR projection dataset is generated. This dataset is basically used for the subsequent analyses, evaluations, and visualizations.
