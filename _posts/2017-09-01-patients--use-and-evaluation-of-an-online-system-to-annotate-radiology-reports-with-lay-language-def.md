## Rationale and Objectives

The increasing availability of personal health portals has made it easier for patients to obtain their imaging results online. However, the radiology report typically is designed to communicate findings and recommendations to the referring clinician, and may contain many terms unfamiliar to lay readers. We sought to evaluate a web-based interface that presented reports of knee MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) examinations with annotations that included patient-oriented definitions, anatomic illustrations, and hyperlinks to additional information.

## Materials and Methods

During a 7-month observational trial, a statement added to all knee MRI reports invited patients to view their annotated report online. We tracked the number of patients who opened their reports, the terms they hovered over to view definitions, and the time hovering over each term. Patients who accessed their annotated reports were invited to complete a survey.

## Results

Of 1138 knee MRI examinations during the trial period, 185 patients (16.3%) opened their report in the viewing portal. Of those, 141 (76%) hovered over at least one term to view its definition, and 121 patients (65%) viewed a mean of 27.5 terms per examination and spent an average of 3.5 minutes viewing those terms. Of the 22 patients who completed the survey, 77% agreed that the definitions helped them understand the report and 91% stated that the illustrations were helpful.

## Conclusions

A system that provided definitions and illustrations of the medical and technical terms in radiology reports has potential to improve patients' understanding of their reports and their diagnoses.

## Introduction

The increasing availability of patient portals—personalized access to the electronic health record—has made it easier for patients to access appointment information, medication lists, and test results online . A survey of adult outpatients undergoing imaging within an academic health system revealed that 64% of respondents were interested in receiving an electronic copy of their radiology report in its original form . A cross-sectional study of more than 100,000 patients within a single health system demonstrated that 51% of the patients who had access to their radiology reports viewed their reports online .

Radiology reports historically have been composed to communicate findings to the ordering physician and guide the next steps in a patient's management . Even though patients now can access their imaging reports, they often find it difficult to interpret the medical jargon contained in these results . In many cases, they also do not fully appreciate the rationale for undergoing an imaging test . Furthermore, the difficulty in understanding reports reviewed online in the absence of a discussion with a physician on the care team may result in miscommunication and unnecessary patient anxiety . To mitigate this anxiety, most patient portals release results after a fixed delay to allow ordering physicians to contact patients directly and discuss abnormal test results before patients can view the results online. A survey of referring physicians did not indicate that they experienced an increased workload as a result of the introduction of patient portals or the implementation of the delay in releasing results to patients .

TABLE 1


Number of Terms Used in Reports and Viewed by the Patients


Number Present in Report Number Viewed Fraction Viewed Unique Terms Total Terms Unique Terms Total Terms Unique Terms (%) Total Terms (%) Minimum 31 44 0 0 0 0 Maximum 72 132 57 464 100 100 Mean 50.0 83.1 16.5 46.7 32 56 Median 50 82 15 23 28 28

Note: If the term “normal” appears four times in a report, for example, that is counted as one unique term and four total terms. The number viewed tallied all terms over which the user hovered to view the definition.

Survey Questions and Responses


Statement Mean Score Agree (%) The definitions of underlined words helped me understand the report. 4.09 17 (77) Reading my report online was helpful. 4.64 21 (95) I understand better what radiologists do. 3.86 15 (68) The pop-up definitions were distracting. 2.05 3 (14) The pictures and drawings were helpful. 4.27 20 (91) The definitions were easy to read and understand. 4.36 18 (82)

Note: Patients were asked to respond using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The table shows the mean score and the number and percentage of patients who responded either 4 or 5 (“Agree”).
