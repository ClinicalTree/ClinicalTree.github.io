## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluated the altered regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in resting state in patients with acute posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 3 months after trauma.

## Materials and Methods

The rCBF was measured in 30 patients with acute PTSD and 36 healthy controls.

## Results

Survivors with acute PTSD showed decreased rCBF, the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale score correlated negatively with the rCBF, and rCBF at resting state decreased in acute PTSD.

## Conclusions

PTSD symptom severity was associated with diminished cerebral blood flow in the right insular cortex and right orbital medial frontal gyrus. The rCBF may predict PTSD symptom severity.

## Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that develops from a sudden, life-threatening, or catastrophic event causing delayed emergence and long-term persistence of mental disorders. Patients experience mental disorders in various ways, including intrusive memories, disturbing recollections, nightmares, flashbacks, distress, and physiological reactions on exposure to reminders of the traumatic event. These disorders seriously affect the patients' quality of life.

Many functional imaging studies have been performed in patients with chronic PTSD. For example, Semple et al. found increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right amygdala, left parahippocampal gyrus, and occipital cortex when patients performed an auditory continuous performance task. Further, patients with PTSD showed decreased frontal cortex and anterior cingulate activity compared to healthy controls. In a similar study, the researchers found a significantly increased rCBF in the orbitofrontal cortex and a reduced left/right hippocampal perfusion ratio in the PTSD group . The subjects in the foregoing studies included veterans with combat-related PTSD and a history of substance abuse, associated with major effects on brain structure and function . Indeed, many patients with PTSD are often heavily medicated or have current or past alcohol and substance abuse issues .
