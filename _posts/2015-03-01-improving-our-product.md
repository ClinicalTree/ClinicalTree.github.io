## Rationale and Objectives

To implement a preprocedural checklist in gastrointestinal (GI)/genitourinary (GU) fluoroscopy suites to assist radiology residents in performing studies with optimal fluoroscopic technique with a goal to lower radiation dose delivered to patients and operators.

## Materials and Methods

We introduced a preprocedural checklist in the form of a mnemonic to first-year resident fluoroscopy operators. The checklist was augmented by teaching sessions at the fluoroscopy tower. Fluoroscopy time (FT) was collected for GI/GU fluoroscopy studies performed by first-year residents who did not use the checklist (year 1) and compared with FT from first-year residents who used the checklist for one full academic year (year 2). Residents in both groups were surveyed to assess their knowledge of radiation safety at the end of their respective radiology 1 (R1) academic years.

## Results

A total of 778 examinations were analyzed from year 1, and 941 total examinations from year 2. After implementation of the checklist, mean FT for all studies decreased by 41.1 seconds ( _P_ < .0001) in year 2 residents. Multivariate linear regression confirmed that year of examination was the strongest independent predictor of FT when other covariates such as resident age, gender, and experience and patient age and gender were included. Radiation safety knowledge was similar in both groups but self-reported confidence in safe fluoroscopy tower operation increased slightly in year 2 ( _P_ = .144).

## Conclusions

A visual preprocedural radiation safety checklist in GI/GU fluoroscopy was associated with a reduction in mean FT and may contribute to a culture of radiation safety awareness.

Since the 1980s, the US population's exposure to medical ionizing radiation has more than doubled . Increased use of computed tomography is the largest source of the increase with smaller contributions from nuclear medicine, interventional fluoroscopy, and conventional radiography and fluoroscopy . Although controversy exists over the degree of risk associated with medical radiation, there is a general consensus in the radiology community that steps should be taken to limit unnecessary exposure. Examples include advocating for the use of the ALARA principle urging radiologists to perform studies delivering a dose of radiation that is “as low as reasonably achievable,” and the development of the _Image Wisely_ and _Image Gently_ guidelines by the American College of Radiology and the Society of Pediatric Radiology, respectively .

Inspired by leaders in medical checklist development and following on from recent efforts to incorporate checklists within radiology departments , we designed a preprocedural checklist for fluoroscopy studies to optimize safe fluoroscopy tower operation with the goal of reducing radiation dose. Our hypothesis is that the use of the checklist will decrease radiation dose delivered to patients and operators (as measured by fluoroscopy time) and will promote the awareness of radiation safety in gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) radiology in our department. The purpose of this study was to operationalize the checklist, assess qualitative and quantitative changes in radiation dose awareness among first-year resident fluoroscopists, and track intraprocedural fluoroscopy times as a surrogate measure of radiation exposure for patients and operators.
