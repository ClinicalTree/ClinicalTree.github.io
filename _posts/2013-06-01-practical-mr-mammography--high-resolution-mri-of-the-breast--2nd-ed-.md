Over the past two decades, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an increasingly popular tool for the detection and characterization of breast pathology. It has established itself as a key imaging modality at many breast imaging centers. This book by Uwe Fisher provides a practical and comprehensive overview of how to perform and analyze breast MRI.

The text is organized into 20 chapters, plus an additional chapter listing all references. The first six chapters offer a detailed introduction to the technical factors of breast MRI, including a very brief summary of basic MRI physics as well as an overview of the standard MRI protocols used in breast imaging and common artifacts encountered. It also clearly summarizes the basic nomenclature of breast lesion characterization using MRI Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System terminology.

Chapter 7 describes the MRI findings in the normal female breast. Chapters 8 through 12 are perhaps the highest yield, thoroughly describing the imaging findings of benign, borderline, and malignant breast lesions. Each diagnosis is presented is a systematic, well-organized manner. In addition to a clearly written description of the MRI findings of each lesion type, the author provides a brief overview of the patient demographics, clinical presentation, x-ray mammography findings, and ultrasound findings. These five chapters alone could serve as a great reference text.

This book also provides a good overview of MRI evaluation of breast reconstructions, imaging the male breast, and MRI-guided breast interventions. This newest edition contains more than 1300 images, well over double the number of images in the first edition. The images are well selected and of high quality.

This book is highly recommended for trainees and practicing radiologists who are interested in learning the basics of performing and interpreting breast MRI. It is an excellent, effectively written, well-organized, and practical introduction to the fundamentals of MR mammography.
