The US Department of Health and Human Services has defined comparative effectiveness research (CER) as “the conduct and synthesis of systematic research comparing different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat and monitor health conditions.” Although this is a broad definition, HHS notes that the “purpose of this research is to inform patients, provider and decision-makers, responding to their expressed needs about which interventions are most effective for which patients under specific circumstances.”

The definition and purpose set by HHS emphasizes patients and their preferences. The Radiology Alliance for Health Services Research (RAHSR) had devoted special issues of _Academic Radiology_ to patient-centered radiology, including ways to improve communication and care delivery, emphasizing patients' preferences . In many ways, communicating with patients represents the biggest challenge to imagers in the provision of patient-centered imaging care. Nonetheless, the American College of Radiology has initiated its Face of Radiology campaign, designed to improve the profile of radiology to its ultimate consumers, patients .

To continue to enhance radiologists' contribution to clinical care, we need to leverage what we do best by creating informatics infrastructure to enable the delivery of patient-centered care and to facilitate CER in the assessment the value of imaging by radiologists . We need to generate the evidence that informs policy decisions using evidence-based techniques broadly applied to clinical questions in imaging as well as develop new research methods to assess patient-centered outcomes that fully reflect our contribution to clinical care .

Continuing on the theme of CER in imaging, the current RAHSR issue presents four new articles. In the interest of teaching our residents, future radiology practitioners, the skills to assess CER in the literature and deliver evidence-based care, Kelly et al describe their institution's experience with a resident-run evidence-based radiology journal club. Bresnahan critically evaluates the economic analysis literature in oncology to understand the quality of the evidence. Reichman et al validate a new reference standard for the diagnosis of vasospasm. Gold et al present a thought-provoking piece on issues of validating a reference standard.

We will continue to face limits on utilization and be required to justify imaging use using evidence-based methods. RAHSR will continue to highlight leading-edge research that will help define the evidence and guide decision makers through this challenging time.
