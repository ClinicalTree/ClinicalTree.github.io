## Background

Disease prevalence alters the number of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false negatives (FN), and false positives (FP), even if the sensitivity and specificity of a test stays the same.

## Methods and Materials

We illustrate this using data for the detection of suspected acute pulmonary embolism (PE) from the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis II (PIOPED II). We chose PE because of the clinical significance of the disease, the low prevalence of PE in the patient population being tested with CTPA with the widespread adoption of CTPA, and the serious clinical consequences of anticoagulation therapy in FP patients.

## Results

Based on PIOPED II data (sensitivity 83%, specificity 96%), at a disease prevalence of approximately 5%, the number of FP patients is greater than the number of TP patients. Scaled to the US population, at a disease prevalence of 5%, there would be 139,800 FPs and 3,356,200 TNs. Assuming a mortality rate of 0.5% and a 3.0% rate of major bleeding secondary to anticoagulation therapy for well-controlled patients, if all FP patients received anticoagulation, there would be 699 deaths and 4194 major bleeding complications.

## Conclusions

At a prevalence of approximately 5% for PE, the number of FPs approaches or is greater than the number of TPs for CTPA for the detection of suspected acute PE. Patients with FP results may receive unnecessary, potentially harmful treatment with anticoagulation therapy. Population prevalence of disease needs to be taken into account along with the diagnostic accuracy of a test, because this may significantly affect downstream patient outcomes.

The proportion of patients with the disease and the proportion of patients without the disease changes as population prevalence changes. This alters the number of true positives, true negatives, false negatives, and false positives, even if the sensitivity and specificity of a test stays the same. At a low prevalence, the number of false positives can approach or be greater than the number of true positives even for diagnostic tests of high sensitivity and specificity. At a prevalence of approximately 5% for pulmonary embolism (PE), the number of false positives approaches or is greater than the number of true positives for computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) or CTPA with CT venography for the detection of suspected acute PE. Patients with false-positive results may receive unnecessary, potentially harmful treatment with anticoagulation therapy and potential adverse events (bleeding). Population prevalence of disease needs to be taken into account along with the diagnostic accuracy of a test, because this may significantly affect downstream patient outcomes.

When considering diagnostic tests including imaging, it is important to assess the test’s diagnostic accuracy. However, diagnostic accuracy is only a single aspect of the overall test characteristic. Other impacts of test performance need to be considered as well as diagnostic accuracy, including diagnostic thinking accuracy, physician decision making, patient outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Even within diagnostic accuracy, which is often expressed as sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy (as measured by the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve), the picture is incomplete. As well as sensitivity (true positive \[TP\] rate), and specificity (true negative \[TN\] rate), the false positive (FP) rate (1, specificity), and false negative (FN) rate (1-sensitivity) should also be considered. However, different prevalences of disease change the proportion of people with the disease (TP and FP) and also the proportion of those without the disease (TN and FP) even if the test’s sensitivity and specificity remain the same. The effect of different prevalences of disease is most evident in the changes of the positive and negative predictive value even if the test’s sensitivity and specificity remain the same.

2 × 2 Contingency Table with True-positive, True-negative, False-negative, and False-positive Results


Disease True False Test outcome Positive True positive

a False positive

b → Positive predictive value = TP/(TP+FP) = a/(a+b) Negative False negative

c True negative

d → Negative predictive value = TN/(TN + FN) = d/(c+d) ↓

Sensitivity = True-positive rate TP/(TP+FN) = a/(a+c)

↓

1-sensitivity = False-negative rate = FN/(TP+FN) = c/(a+c) ↓

Specificity = True-negative rate TN/(FP+TN) = d/(b+d)

↓

1-specificity = False-positive rate = FP/(FP+TN) = b/(b+) → Accuracy = (TP+TN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN) = (a+d)/(a+b+c+d)

→ Prevalence = (TP+FN)/(TP+FP+FN+TN) = (a+c)/(a+b+c+d)

Sensitivity (true-positive rate), specificity (true-negative rate), false-negative rate (1-sensitivity), false-positive rate (1-specificity), accuracy, and prevalence calculated.
