This book is another of a multibook series published by Thieme (series title RadCases), each covering a major subspecialty of radiology. It is a compilation of 100 cases aimed at giving radiology residents and trainees a review of primarily commonly encountered and need-to-know diagnoses. Cases are presented as unknowns on a single page, with the diagnosis and discussion on the following page. The overall format is easy to follow and lends itself to short sessions but can certainly be read straight through. The textâ€™s large (but thin) size allows full image resolution for computed tomography (CT) and good resolution for plain radiographs. This alleviates some of the problems with other similar series where subtle findings can be difficult to visualize.

As in other books of this series, the case organization is constant. After the case images and a brief clinical history, an initial section summarizes the pertinent imaging findings. A smaller version of each image is shown with arrows and accompanying text. In the text, the authors do a good job of providing a boards-style monologue that succinctly summarizes the findings. This is followed by a bulleted list of differential diagnoses. Two to five diagnoses are listed, and for the most part so are the common clinical considerations, though a few unusual entities do appear. Another bulleted section follows this, entitled Essential Facts. This section addresses the findings and how they relate to the diagnosis, and other pertinent information. Occasionally, alternate imaging findings are discussed following this, tending to focus on classic imaging features not be present on the selected images.

The last section for each case is called Pearls and Pitfalls, again with bulleted information. The distinction between this and the facts section is sometimes lacking, but the given pitfalls can be very useful. These include limitations of technique, contraindications, and other need to know facts.

The examinations are a predominantly plain film followed by CT, with occasional magnetic resonance images given. The image quality is usually very good, well windowed, and cropped appropriately. The plain films selected are not given at full resolution, but the imaging findings are usually not subtle, and the focus of the book is more geared toward developing a differential list. The cases are need-to-know diagnoses ubiquitous in thoracic imaging. More uncommon diagnoses do appear, though they are in the minority. The case mix focuses on lung parenchymal and neoplastic disease, with a good showing of mediastinal and chest wall pathology. There is limited cardiac exposure.

In addition to the cases in the book, your purchase allows you access to the online version of the book, which includes 150 additional cases, plus the 100 in the book. These are organized identically, with the added ability to magnify images. A short registration is required unless you have previously registered.
