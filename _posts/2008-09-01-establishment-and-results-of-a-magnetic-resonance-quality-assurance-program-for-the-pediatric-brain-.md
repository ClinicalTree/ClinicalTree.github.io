## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is used to assess brain tumor response to therapies, and a MR quality assurance (QA) program is necessary for multicenter clinical trials employing imaging. This study was performed to determine overall variability of quantitative imaging metrics measured with the American College of Radiology (ACR) phantom among 11 sites participating in the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) Neuroimaging Center (NIC) MR QA program.

## Materials and Methods

An MR QA program was implemented among 11 participating PBTC sites and quarterly evaluations of scanner performance for seven imaging metrics defined by the ACR were sought and subject to statistical evaluation over a 4.5-year period. Overall compliance with the QA program, means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation (CV) for the quantitative imaging metrics were evaluated.

## Results

Quantitative measures of the seven imaging metrics were generally within ACR recommended guidelines for all sites. Compliance improved as the study progressed. Intersite variabilities, as gauged by CV for slice thickness and geometric accuracy, imaging parameters that influence size or positioning measurements in tumor studies, were on the order of 10% and 1%, respectively.

## Conclusions

Although challenging to establish, MR QA programs within the context of PBTC multisite clinical trials when based on the ACR MR phantom program can indicate sites performing below acceptable image quality levels and establish levels of precision through instrumental variabilities that are relevant to quantitative image analyses (eg, tumor volume changes).

Among children ages 0–19 years, the incidence rate for pediatric brain tumors was 29.1 cases/1,000,000 between 1996 and 2003 ( ). Given these statistics, efforts to accrue sufficient numbers of patients for investigating more effective treatment strategies must hinge largely on multicenter trials, a defining feature of the National Institutes of Health–funded Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC), established in 1999. Comprising 10 major pediatric brain tumor research centers and the neuro-oncology branch of the National Cancer Institute, the PBTC broadened its mission in 2003 with the addition of the Neuroimaging Center (NIC) whose mission is three-fold to: 1) coordinate imaging research; 2) provide imaging support for novel therapeutic trials; and 3) develop a framework by which correlative imaging data are codified and uniformly applied to PBTC multicenter trials.

Equipped with relatively sophisticated neuroimaging capabilities and a commitment to neuroimaging research, the NIC is intensively engaged in facilitating quality assurance (QA) and promoting clinically relevant imaging research. Specifically, imaging acquisition protocols aimed primarily at positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance (MR) must be continuously analyzed, modified, updated, and uniformly applied across institutions and within relevant trials. The importance of standardizing acquisition protocols among sites cannot be understated. After protocols are standardized, tumor volume measurements, for example, typically calculated during most trials, can be compared reliably to those taken during similar or equivalent trials within the PBTC. In addition to standardizing imaging protocols, the NIC is assessing the variability of basic imaging metrics among the various PBTC instruments, gauging whether statistically significant differences exist, and determining whether these differences affect or skew findings within representative PBTC cohorts. An assessment of variability measures is an essential feature of any comprehensive QA program ( ), and nowhere is this more evident than in the context of MR, in general, and in the efforts of the NIC, in particular.
