## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiac computed tomography (CCT) in the emergency department may be cost saving for suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but economic outcome data are limited. The objective of this study was to compare the cost of CCT-based evaluation versus standard of care (SOC) using the results of a clinical trial.

## Materials and Methods

We developed a decision analytic cost-minimization model to compare CCT-based and SOC evaluation costs to obtain a correct diagnosis. Model inputs, including Medicare-adjusted patient costs, were primarily obtained from a cohort study of 102 patients at low to intermediate risk for ACS who underwent an emergency department SOC clinical evaluation and a 64-channel CCT. SOC costs included stress testing in 77% of patients. Data from published literature completed the model inputs and expanded data ranges for sensitivity analyses.

## Results

Modeled mean patient costs for CCT-based evaluation were $750 (24%) lower than the SOC ($2384 and $3134, respectively). Sensitivity analyses indicated that CCT was less expensive over a wide range of estimates and was only more expensive with a CCT specificity below 67% or if more than 44% of very low risk patients had CCT. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that CCT-based evaluation had a 98.9% probability of being less expensive compared to SOC.

## Conclusion

Using a decision analytic model, CCT-based evaluation resulted in overall lower cost than the SOC for possible ACS patients over a wide range of cost and outcome assumptions, including computed tomography–related complications and downstream costs.

In the United States, chest pain accounts for 5% of all emergency department (ED) visits and is a substantial economic and health resource burden . In 2008, the United States spent approximately $12 billion for the evaluation of acute chest pain . The current standard of care (SOC) for individuals presenting with possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS) often involves multiple tests over hours to days. Rest and stress single photon emission computed tomography is commonly used to test for myocardial ischemia with high sensitivity, but only after exclusion of myocardial damage. Multislice electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography can rapidly differentiate multiple causes of symptomatic vascular disease including coronary artery disease (CAD) with high diagnostic sensitivity. As a result, use of ECG-gated thoracic computed tomography (CT) as part of a rapid evaluation in patients at low to intermediate risk of ACS may be less expensive than the SOC .

Previous economic model evaluations of cardiac CT (CCT) for evaluation of ACS suggested that CCT is less expensive than an SOC , but may be more costly with the inclusion of downstream costs associated with CT, such as iodinated contrast complications or incidental, noncardiac CT findings . However, no study to date has incorporated both actual ED patient costs and downstream costs associated with CCT.

Costs were based on or adjusted to 2007 Medicare-based reimbursement amounts except for cardiac imaging costs which were based on 2010 Medicare reimbursements. Baseline costs were derived from patient data when available. The patient and literature data provided the range of values used for sensitivity and probabilistic Monte Carlo analyses. All costs were in US dollars ($).
