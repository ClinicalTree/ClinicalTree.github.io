Oral presentations remain a common teaching method in academic radiology. The goal of these presentations is to transfer knowledge from the presenter’s brain to brains in the audience in a way that sticks. A number of studies from the recent psychological and physiological literature offer some rather practical and evidence-based advice on ways to optimize our oral presentations. The purpose of this paper is to summarize this work, and to give examples of how it can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of radiology presentations, whether they are for resident education, a continuing medical education course, or for a scientific presentation at a national radiology meeting.

## INTRODUCTION

What is the best way to present information to our students so that they remember it? Radiology educators have experimented with many approaches over the years, which boil down to four principle techniques: we show them images, we talk about the images, we give them materials to read (and write), and we teach them to do procedures. In the educational literature, these four learning styles are sometimes summarized with the acronym VARK (visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic) . Most of our educational presentations involve the first three of these learning styles.

Learning is all the more remarkable, when one considers that we forget most of the things that happen to us in a given day. What is it that distinguishes these events from those that we choose to learn and remember? A number of studies from the recent psychological and physiological literature offer some practical insights into how this happens. It is clear that learning is influenced by the characteristics of particular stimuli and how they are processed. There is also evidence that motivational states can play an important role in information that is consigned to long-term memory.

Much of the early work in educational psychology relied on subjective information from the experimental subjects. More recently, experimenters have employed electroencephalography, positron-emission tomography, magnetoencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain objective data about which parts of the brain are active during various educational interventions. This type of research has led to some fascinating results. For example, one fMRI study showed that when a speaker and a listener are communicating well, the brain activity of the listener actually mirrors that of the speaker . This synchronization of brain activity has been termed neural coupling, and greater neural coupling between the speaker and the listener is associated with greater understanding by the listener.

Advances in the psychology and physiology of learning have been paralleled by similar advances in pedagogical techniques. However, despite a current trend toward more active teaching techniques, the oral presentation remains one of the main tools in our educational arsenal. This is true not only for residency training but also for scientific meetings and for continuing medical education events . Until oral presentations are someday replaced by more effective methods, we want our presentations to be as effective as possible.

Much has been written on the topic of optimal presentation design . National organizations such as the Radiological Society of North America, the American Roentgen Ray Society, and the Association of University Radiologists have long sponsored programs to improve the presentation skills of their speakers. However, much of the presentation advice in these publications and programs consists of personal preferences, anecdotes, and opinions, and little of it has undergone experimental validation. Fortunately, recent research into the psychology and physiology of learning has led to a number of practical results that have undergone such validation. The purpose of this paper is to summarize some of this work, and to present several evidence-based principles that can be harnessed to optimize radiology presentations.
