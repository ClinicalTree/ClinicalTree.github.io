## Rationale and Objectives

To analyze the pattern and longitudinal evolution of honorary authorship in major radiology journals.

## Materials and Methods

In this Institutional Review Board-approved study, an electronic survey was sent to first authors of original research articles published in the _American Journal of Roentgenology, European Radiology_ , the _Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging_ , and _Radiology_ during 2 years (July 2014 through June 2016). Questions addressed the perception of honorary authorship and contributing factors, as well as demographic information. Univariate analysis was performed by using χ2 tests. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess independent factors associated with the perception of honorary authorship.

## Results

Of 1839 first authors, 315 (17.3%) responded. Of these, 31.4% (97/309) perceived that at least one coauthor did not make sufficient contributions to merit authorship and 54.3% (159/293) stated that one or more coauthors performed only “nonauthor” tasks according to International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria. Of eight factors significantly associated with the perception of honorary authorship on univariate analysis, two were retained by the stepwise multivariate model: having someone suggest adding an author and a coauthor performing only a nonauthorship task.

## Conclusion

There has been little variation in the perception of honorary authorship among first authors of original research articles in radiology. The suggestion of adding an author and having coauthors performing only nonauthorship tasks are the two most important risk factors for honorary authorship. Our findings indicate that a prolonged course of transformation of current cultural norms is required to decrease honorary authorship.

## Introduction

Honorary authorship is a major ethical problem for biomedical journals . In radiology, our two studies showed substantial rates of perceived honorary authorship among first authors of original articles in major journals and an even higher frequency of first authors indicating that one or more coauthors performed only “nonauthor” tasks according to the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) . A journal editorial decried the practice of honorary authorship, suggesting a change in the internal culture of radiology departments, and the International Society for Strategic Studies in Radiology unanimously endorsed the ICMJE guidelines for authorship, with its members pledging to ensure that colleagues in the institutions and departments fully adhere to them.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the pattern and longitudinal evolution of honorary authorship in major radiology journals.

Factors Influencing the Perception of Honorary Authorship

Note that the _P_ value is for testing the null hypothesis that the two conditional probabilities are the same, eg, probability (perception of honorary authorship = yes/awareness of issue = yes) = probability (perception of honorary authorship = yes/awareness of issue = no). With the _P_ value of .691, the two observed conditional probability estimates of 30.70% and 32.98% are not statistically different.

Note that the _P_ value is for testing if the conditional probability of “yes” of the perception of honorary authorship varies across levels of the covariates such as journal type, academic title, years of experience, and continent of practice and training.
