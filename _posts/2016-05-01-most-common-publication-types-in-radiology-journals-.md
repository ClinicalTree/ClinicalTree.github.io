## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to assess the most common publication types in radiology journals, as well as temporal trends and association with citation frequency.

## Materials and Methods

PubMed was searched to extract all published articles having the following “Publication Type” indices: “validation studies,” “meta-analysis,” “clinical trial,” “comparative study,” “evaluation study,” “guideline,” “multicenter study,” “randomized study,” “review,” “editorial,” “case report,” and “technical report.” The percentage of articles within each category published within clinical radiology journals was computed. Normalized percentages for each category were also computed on an annual basis. Citation counts within a 2-year window following publication were obtained using Web of Science. Overall trends were assessed.

## Results

Publication types with the highest fraction in radiology journals were technical reports, evaluation studies, and case reports (4.8% to 5.8%). Publication types with the lowest fraction in radiology journals were randomized trials, multicenter studies, and meta-analyses (0.8% to 1.5%). Case reports showed a significant decrease since 1999, with accelerating decline since 2007 ( _P_ = 0.002). Publication types with highest citation counts were meta-analyses, guidelines, and multicenter studies (8.1 ± 10.7 to 12.9 ± 5.1). Publication types with lowest citation counts were case reports, editorials, and technical reports (1.4 ± 2.4 to 2.9 ± 4.3). The representation in radiology journals and citation frequency of the publication types showed weak inverse correlation (r = −0.372).

## Conclusions

Radiology journals have historically had relatively greater representation of less frequently cited publication types. Various strategies, including methodological training, multidisciplinary collaboration, national support networks, as well as encouragement of higher level of evidence by funding agencies and radiology journals themselves, are warranted to improve the impact of radiological research.

## Introduction

The peer-reviewed literature serves as the primary mechanism for scientific investigators in the biomedical sciences to communicate their findings and ultimately influence clinical management. Published articles are associated with varying levels of evidence, ranging for instance from case reports to clinical trials to meta-analyses, as well as encompassing content beyond original research, such as editorials, reviews, and guidelines. These different article categories, in turn, may advance knowledge and impact subsequent scientific investigations and patient care to varying degrees.

Researchers within radiology have been challenged to focus upon research that meets the highest of standards of evidence-based medicine and that is most anticipated to advance human health . For instance, although not systematically evaluated, it has been suggested that existing research within the field of magnetic resonance imaging largely comprises lower levels of evidence, such as observational studies, proof-of-concept studies, and small cohort studies . In addition, case reports historically represented a common article type within the radiologic literature . An awareness of current trends regarding the most common article types within the radiology literature, as well as variation in impact among these types (as assessed by the frequency of citations), may help inform investigators and journal editors regarding key areas of priority for subsequent research design. Therefore, in this study, we assess the most common publication types in radiology journals, as well as temporal trends and association with citation frequency.
