## Rationale and Objectives

The accurate delineation of tumor recurrence and its differentiation from radiation injury in the follow-up of adjuvantly treated high-grade gliomas presents a significant problem in neuro-oncology. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hemodynamic parameters derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to distinguish recurrent gliomas from radiation necrosis.

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen patients who were being treated for glial neoplasms underwent prospectively conventional and DCE-MRI using a 3T scanner. The pharmacokinetic modelling was based on a two-compartment model that allows for the calculation of _K_ trans (transfer constant between intra- and extravascular, extracellular space), v _e_ (extravascular, extracellular space), k _ep_ (transfer constant from the extracellular, extravascular space into the plasma), and iAUC (initial area under the signal intensity-time curve). Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the entire recurrence-suspected contrast-enhanced region. A definitive diagnosis was established at subsequent surgical resection or clinicoradiologic follow-up. The hemodynamic parameters in the contralateral normal white matter, the radiation injury sites, and the tumor recurrent lesions were compared using nonparametric tests.

## Results

The _K_ trans , v _e_ , k _ep_ , and iAUC values in the normal white matter were significantly different than those in the radiation necrosis and recurrent gliomas (0.01, < _P_ < .0001). The only significantly different hemodynamic parameter between the recurrent tumor lesions and the radiation-induced necrotic sites were _K_ trans and iAUC, which were significantly higher in the recurrent glioma group than in the radiation necrosis group ( _P_ ≤ .0184). A _K_ trans cutoff value higher than 0.19 showed 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity for detecting the recurrent gliomas, whereas an iAUC cutoff value higher than 15.35 had 71% sensitivity and 71% specificity. The v _e_ and k _ep_ values in recurrent tumors were not significantly higher than those in radiation-induced necrotic lesions.

## Conclusions

These findings suggest that DCE-MRI may be used to distinguish between recurrent gliomas and radiation injury and thus, assist in follow-up patient management strategy.

Radiation necrosis is typically indistinguishable from recurrent gliomas at conventional contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both entities often manifest as a mass lesion with varying degrees of surrounding edema and progressive enhancement on serial MRI . However, at histopathologic examination, one finds that radiation necrosis and recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) are markedly dissimilar . Physiological imaging techniques, such as T2\*-weighted dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material–enhanced (DSC) perfusion MRI, have substantially advanced the clinical use of MRI for differentiating the recurrent GMBs from the radiation necrosis. DSC perfusion MRI enables the following three hemodynamic measurements to be obtained within the brain: cerebral blood volume (CBV), peak height (PH), and percentage of signal intensity recovery (PSR) . Several publications have shown that DSC MRI measurements strongly correlate with primary glioma tumor vascular density and overall histopathologic grade . In other studies, DSC perfusion MRI has been applied to differentiate between a single brain metastasis and high-grade glioma, recurrent brain metastases from gamma knife–induced radiation necrosis, and to distinguish recurrent GBM from radiation necrosis after external beam radiation , though initial studies showed that many cases may have an indeterminate result .

Nevertheless, DSC perfusion MRI has a number of significant disadvantages . The paramagnetic recruitment effect leads to distortion of anatomy particularly where contrast lies within large vessels. Most T2- and T2\*-weighted images will exhibit some degree of T1 sensitivity and will show signal changes resulting from relaxivity effects particularly from contrast agent that has leaked into the extravascular extracellular space. Thus, the use of contrast preenhancement or low T1 sensitivity-based sequences is prerequisite for a reliable dynamic imaging of enhancing brain lesions with blood-brain barrier disruption . More importantly, when considering application to tumors, the effects of extravascular leakage of contrast material on the T2 or T2\* signal are difficult to quantify and, although estimates of contrast transfer coefficient can be made these are less reliable than those obtained with comparable dynamic T1-weighted contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) . Therefore, DCE-MRI is primarily recommended for pharmacodynamic assessment of antiangiogenic and antivascular therapies .

Note the high K trans and iAUC values (0.2 min −1 and 16.7 mM×s, respectively) ( arrows ) on the lateral side of the resection cavity and the lower K trans and iAUC values (0.13 min −1 and 7.21 mM×s, respectively) ( arrowheads ) on the medial side. The signal intensity-time curve on the lateral area of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) breakdown (ROI 1) shows distinct features with increasing accumulation of contrast agent over a time of about 4 minutes after arrival of the bolus. The gadolinium wash-in phase on the medial side (ROI 2) is also prolonged but the relative enhancement does not reach the level of the lateral lesion. Moreover, both BBB-distorted areas show significantly higher enhancement and upslope curves compared to the normal white matter (ROI 3). The PET-CT imaging shows a more increased accumulation of methionine in the lateral lesion compared to the medial one. The anatomic MR imaging (f) on the same date shows the contrast enhancement on both sides of the cavity ( arrow and arrowhead ). The follow-up MR imaging (2 months later) (g) demonstrates an increase in the contrast enhancement on the lateral side of the cavity, whereas the medial side remains largely unchanged. The patient underwent surgical resection of both enhancing lesions and the histology showed a glioma recurrence in the sample from the laterally located lesion.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DistinguishingRecurrentHighgradeGliomasfromRadiationInjury/0_1s20S1076633211000638.jpg)

![Figure 4, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the transfer constant between intra- and extravascular, extracellular space ( K trans ) (a) and initial area under the signal intensity-time curve (iAUC) (b) values for predicting tumor recurrence or radiation necrosis. In the plots, a yellow line is drawn at a 45° angle tangent to the ROC curve. This marks a good cutoff point under the assumption that false negatives and false positives have similar costs. Note the better sensitivity and specificity (including the area under the curve) of K trans compared to iAUC. Logistic fits of histology by K trans (c) and iAUC (d) show that as K trans and iAUC increase, the model gives more probability (as indicated in the y axis) to K trans for predicting the recurrence. For example, at iAUC around 20 (d) , most of the probability is attributed to recurrence. If the histology is completely predicted by the value of the factor, then the logistic curve is effectively vertical like in (c) at K trans = 0.19.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DistinguishingRecurrentHighgradeGliomasfromRadiationInjury/3_1s20S1076633211000638.jpg)
