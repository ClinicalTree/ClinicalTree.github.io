As ACGME (Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education) requirements have expanded and become increasingly more complex, so has the role of the program coordinator. Over the last decade, the knowledge and skills required to capably administer residency and fellowship training programs have increased in both volume and complexity. Today's coordinators are responsible for more than clerical tasks. They also function as managers and have greater roles in the development and implementation of program initiatives, policies, and outcomes. As a result, coordinators' roles and responsibilities have evolved to include management skills. To keep pace with the rapid and continuing change, it is imperative that coordinators continue to develop these skill sets to add value to their programs, institutions, and careers.

Since 1999, when the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Medical Specialties established the six core competencies as the rubric for graduate medical education (GME) training, the requirements for the administration of residency and fellowship programs have snowballed. Increasing demands on the program director to be a clinician, educator, curriculum developer, mentor, compliance manager, _and_ training director have, consequently, opened the door to new opportunities for the profession of the program coordinator. We have had to assume some of the burden from our program directors whose primary responsibility remains patient care. Our role has evolved from a coordinator of tasks and resources to a manager of people, policies, and outcomes. Our responsibilities have transformed to include skills traditionally associated with management. We must not only keep pace but also develop new skills to master rapid and continuing change. It is imperative that we, as program coordinators, embrace continual learning and develop new skill sets that add value to our programs, institutions, and careers.

What are the new skills needed to be an effective program coordinator today? To transform from coordinator to manager? In this article, we discuss the five new skill sets we believe are now necessary for our profession: managing change, managing up, utilizing quality improvement methodologies, analyzing data, and developing professionally.

Note: Because it is the currently accepted term used by the ACGME, this article uses the term program coordinator to refer to program coordinators, managers, and administrators .

## Managing Change

Change management is necessary for program development. Advocating for change, influencing others, working strategically to build support and consensus, and planning for implementation originate from a change manager, also known as a change agent. A change agent does not single-handedly enact transformation but rather creates the environment for change, coordinates the process, and leads the charge. A change agent looks down the road to see what is coming, identifies long-term challenges and potential opportunities, and anticipates changes that should be implemented to meet future needs. As the best-laid plans do not always anticipate all variables, the change agent must be flexible and demonstrate the ability to reconsider and revise goals. As program coordinators, we are well suited to this task because of the intimate knowledge of our programs, tenures that bridge program directors, and full-time commitment to program administration.

This skill set is not limited to program directors, department chairpersons, and institute leadership; it should be developed and utilized by program coordinators as well. By embracing the need for this skill set and integrating its objectives into our workday, we will add value to our programs and institutions. Thomson et al. articulate the need for change management, “In an era of great upheaval and great uncertainty in the future direction for the US healthcare system…change management skills and transformational leadership will be ingredients of successful performance in the academic medical center today and in the near future.”
