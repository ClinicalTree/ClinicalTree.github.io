## Rationale and Objectives

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by progressive respiratory function impairment and respiratory muscle dysfunction. We hypothesized that the mass and fat infiltration of respiratory muscles correlates with COPD severity and emphysema extent.

## Materials and Methods

Ninety-eight male patients with COPD underwent chest computed tomography (CT) and spirometry. The mass and fat infiltrations of intercostal and latissimus muscles were quantified as the cross-sectional area (CSA) and attenuation of these muscles using CT histogram analysis. Intercostal index and latissimus index were defined as intercostal CSAs and latissimus CSAs divided by body mass index. The emphysema extent was measured as the ratio of the emphysematous lung volume to the total lung volume using a density-mask technique. Pearson correlation analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between these parameters. Multiple regression analysis was performed using forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) as the dependent parameter and the clinical and CT data as the independent parameters.

## Results

FEV  1 was significantly correlated with intercostal index ( _r_ = 0.57), latissimus index ( _r_ = 0.34), intercostal attenuation ( _r_ = 0.62), and latissimus attenuation ( _r_ = 0.38). Emphysema extent was significantly correlated with intercostal index ( _r_ = −0.36) and intercostal attenuation ( _r_ = −0.50). Multiple regression analysis showed that FEV  1 was predicted by intercostal attenuation ( _B_ = 0.40), intercostal CSA ( _B_ = 0.23), emphysema extent ( _B_ = −0.23), and age ( _B_ = −0.21, _R_ 2 = 0.64, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

A decrease in intercostal mass and an increase in intercostal fat are associated with worsening of COPD severity.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease by progressive respiratory function impairment and skeletal muscle dysfunction . The emphysema extent measured by computed tomography (CT) has been correlated with COPD severity (forced expiratory volume in 1 second \[FEV  1 \]) and airflow obstruction (FEV  1 / forced vital capacity \[FVC\]) in the previous studies . The loss of muscle mass and change of muscle composition are important factors for assessing the skeletal muscle dysfunction. It has been demonstrated that quadriceps muscle area was correlated with COPD severity , and the depletion of peripheral muscle mass was a better predictor of mortality than body mass index (BMI) in patients with COPD . Furthermore, the attenuation of the mid-thigh muscle in elderly persons was associated with muscle strength and mobility performance .

Among skeletal muscles, respiratory muscles are unique and crucial for alveolar ventilation . Respiratory muscle weakness may result in dyspnea and respiratory failure, which are associated with high risks of mortality in patients with COPD . Intercostal and latissimus dorsi muscles have major and minor roles for respiration, respectively. Few studies have investigated the structure and function of intercostal muscle and latissimus muscle , but they did not fully address the mass and tissue composition of these muscles in patients with COPD. Therefore, we aimed to quantify the mass and fat infiltration of intercostal and latissimus dorsi muscles and the emphysema extent using chest CT and to investigate their relationship with COPD severity and airflow obstruction.
