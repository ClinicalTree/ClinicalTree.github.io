## Rationale and Objectives

The Socratic method has long been a traditional teaching method in medicine and law. It is currently accepted as the standard of teaching in clinical wards, while the didactic teaching method is widely used during the first 2 years of medical school. There are arguments in support of both styles of teaching.

## Materials and Methods

After attending a radiology conference demonstrating different teaching methods, third-year and fourth-year medical students were invited to participate in an online anonymous survey.

## Results

Of the 74 students who responded, 72% preferred to learn radiology in an active context. They preferred being given adequate time to find abnormalities on images, with feedback afterward from instructors, and they thought the best approach was a volunteer-based system of answering questions using the Socratic method in the small group. They desired to be asked questions in a way that was constructive and not belittling, to realize their knowledge deficits and to have daily pressure to come prepared. The respondents thought that pimping was an effective teaching tool, supporting previous studies.

## Conclusions

When teaching radiology, instructors should use the Socratic method to a greater extent. Combining Socratic teaching with gentle questioning by an instructor through the use of PowerPoint is a preferred method among medical students. This information is useful to improve medical education in the future, especially in radiology education.

There are arguments in support of both styles of teaching.

The didactic method is efficient and useful to disseminate a large amount of information in a brief amount of time to a large audience. Students passively listen in lecture while the lecturer presents a topic. To provide a baseline foundation of information to first-year and second-year students, the didactic method is commonly used. Medical schools across the country have been incorporating problem-based learning into the preclinical years to encourage more active learning, but a criticism is that although students retain information better through problem-based learning, the breadth of knowledge covered is not as wide as through didactic teaching.
