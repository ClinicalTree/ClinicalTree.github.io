## Rationale and Objectives

Contrast-enhanced digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis are two imaging techniques that attempt to increase malignant breast lesion conspicuity. The combination of these into a single technique, contrast-enhanced digital breast tomosynthesis (CE-DBT), could potentially integrate the strengths of both. The objectives of this study were to assess the clinical feasibility of CE-DBT as an adjunct to digital mammography, and to correlate lesion enhancement characteristics and morphology obtained with CE-DBT to digital mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance (MR).

## Materials and Methods

CE-DBT (GE Senographe 2000D; Milwaukee, WI) was performed as a pilot study in an ongoing National Cancer Institute–funded grant (P01-CA85484) studying multimodality breast imaging. Thirteen patients with ACR BI-RADS category 4 or 5 breast lesions underwent imaging with digital mammography, ultrasound, MR, and CE-DBT. CE-DBT was performed at 49 kVp with a rhodium target and a 0.27-mm copper (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) filter. Preinjection and postinjection DBT image sets were acquired in the medial lateral oblique projection with slight compression. Each image set consists of nine images acquired over a 50-degree arc and was obtained with a mean glandular x-ray dose comparable to two conventional mammographic views. Between the precontrast and postcontrast DBT image sets, a single bolus of iodinated contrast agent (1 ml/kg at 2 ml/s, Omnipaque-300; Amersham Health Inc., Princeton, NJ) was administered. Images were reconstructed using filtered-backprojection in 1-mm increments and transmitted to a clinical PACS workstation.

## Results

Initial experience suggests that CE-DBT provides morphologic and vascular characteristics of breast lesions qualitatively concordant with that of digital mammography and MR.

## Conclusion

As an adjunct to digital mammography, CE-DBT may be a potential alternative tool for breast lesion morphologic and vascular characterization.

Vascular neoangiogenesis has been shown to be essential for breast cancer growth ( ). Malignant breast tumor angiogenesis factors stimulate formation of disorganized vessel networks with abnormally increased vessel permeability ( ). As a result, the enhancement pattern of breast cancers with vascular contrast agents often differs from that of benign and normal breast tissues. This aspect of breast cancer biology has been most extensively illustrated with gadolinium-enhanced breast magnetic resonance (MR), which when applied clinically provides vascular characterization of breast lesions ( ).

X-ray techniques combined with contrast agents are also able to demonstrate this feature of breast cancer biology, as has been illustrated with digital subtraction angiography of the breast ( ) and contrast-enhanced CT of the breast ( ). Jong et al. ( ), Lewin et al. ( ), and Diekmann et al. ( ) have demonstrated that enhancement of breast cancers can be detected with contrast-enhanced digital mammography and that this technique can increase mammographic lesion conspicuity.
