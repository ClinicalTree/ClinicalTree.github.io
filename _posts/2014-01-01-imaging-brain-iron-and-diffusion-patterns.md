## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine changes of brain iron content and diffusion patterns longitudinally in early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients using T2- and T2\*-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over 2-year follow-up.

## Materials and Methods

We imaged 32 PD patients with tremor and 19 healthy controls. A follow-up study (median 25 months, range 22–31 months) was accomplished for 25 patients (men:women = 11:14; age range 44–87 years, median 73 years). All patients and healthy volunteers underwent clinical, neuropsychological, and MRI examinations on the same day. Three different MRI sequences were used and their results were compared: T2-weighted imaging, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and T2\* mapping. Additionally, we evaluated diffusion tensor data between groups using tract-based spatial statistics.

## Results

Over the 2-year follow-up, the iron-related relaxation increased in the globus pallidus anterior and the caudate nucleus and slightly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). In the globus pallidus anterior and medial SNc, the change was associated with mild cognitive impairment. In the caudate nucleus, the increase was pronounced in patients with disease onset at 67 years or older. In the SNc, medial transverse relaxation was increased, and in the thalamus, it was decreased, in patients with PD compared with healthy volunteers at 2-year follow-up. Tract-based spatial statistical data did not differ between groups based on gender or Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, but a slight tendency to decreasing fractional anisotropy ( _P_ < .10) in the genu of corpus callosum and bilaterally in corona radiata was seen over 2 years.

## Conclusions

PD-related changes were found in putative iron content over 2 years. Although mild in the initial stages, these changes were consistent over MRI sequences. Rather than correlating with disease duration, the rate of changes was associated with individual characters, such as cognitive decline and age.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability . These motor symptoms are the basis of the diagnosis. Although the disease is incurable, various treatment options are available to enhance the quality of life, and new neuroprotective agents are constantly being developed . Depending on treatment, early initiation of therapy may provide benefit for the patient . Therefore, early diagnosis and initiation of therapy including follow-up are urgently needed. An accurate diagnosis of PD is challenging and increasingly complemented by imaging .

Imaging findings in PD patients are limited, but slight changes may be found with improving imaging techniques. Imaging of PD patients has made the most progress in the area of imaging dopamine transporters using positron emission tomography and various techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . In addition to spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional imaging, one of the aspects investigated with MRI is the brain iron content, which is increased in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) of PD patients . The brain iron content is associated with the loss of dopamine, and their concentrations seem to correlate as earlier shown in putamen . Therefore, because diagnostically promising results on the loss of dopamine have been reported with positron emission tomography , the results may be indirectly repeated by imaging iron with nonionizing MRI.
