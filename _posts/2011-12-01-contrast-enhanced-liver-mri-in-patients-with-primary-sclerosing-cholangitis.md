## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the enhancement pattern of focal confluent fibrosis (FCF) on contrast-enhanced hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using hepatocyte-specific (Gd-EOB-DTPA) and extracellular (ECA) gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).

## Materials and Methods

After institutional review board approval, 10 patients with PSC (6 male, 4 female; 33–61 years) with 13 FCF were included in this retrospective study. All patients had a Gd-EOB-DTPA–enhanced liver MRI exam, and a comparison ECA-enhanced MRI. On each T1-weighted dynamic dataset, the signal intensity (SI) of FCF and the surrounding liver as well as the paraspinal muscle (M) were measured. In the Gd-EOB-DTPA group, hepatocyte phase images were also included. SI FCF/SI M, SI liver/SI M, and \[(SI liver − SI FCF)/SI liver\] were compared between the different contrast agents for each dynamic phase using the paired Student’s _t_ -test.

## Results

There was no significant difference in SI FCF/SI M in all imaging phases. SI liver/SI M was significantly higher for the Gd-EOB-DTPA group in the delayed phase ( _P_ < .001), whereas there was no significant difference in all other imaging phases. In the Gd-EOB-DTPA group, mean \[(SI liver − SI FCF)/SI liver\] were as follows (values for ECA group in parentheses): unenhanced phase: 0.26 (0.26); arterial phase: 0.01 (−0.31); portal venous phase (PVP): −0.05 (−0.26); delayed phase (DP): 0.14 (−0.54); and hepatocyte phase: 0.26. Differences were significant for the DP ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

On delayed phase MR images the FCF-to-liver contrast is reversed with the lesions appearing hyperintense on ECA enhanced images and hypointense on Gd-EOB-DTPA–enhanced images.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a chronic cholestatic liver disease of unknown cause, is characterized by fibrosing inflammatory destruction of the bile ducts, subsequent hepatic fibrosis, and ultimately cirrhosis . In patients with PSC, peripheral wedge-shaped areas of parenchymal atrophy, also called confluent hepatic fibrosis or focal confluent fibrosis (FCF) , have been described in up to 72%; these focal confluent fibrotic lesions typically show hypoenhancement on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained immediately after administration of iodinated CT or extracellular gadolinium-based MR contrast agents and hyperenhancement on delayed phase images . Because these FCF are oftentimes mildly hyperintense on T2-weighted (T2w) MR imaging, they are among the most relevant differential considerations for hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.

To the best of our knowledge, the enhancement pattern of FCF on fat saturated dynamic T1w MR imaging performed after administration of GD-EOB-DTPA (gadoxetate disodium, Eovist/Primovist, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc, Wayne, NJ) has not been described yet. Therefore, this study was performed to assess the enhancement pattern of focal confluent fibrosis on contrast-enhanced hepatic MR imaging using hepatocyte-specific (Gd-EOB-DTPA) and extracellular (ECA) gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with PSC.
