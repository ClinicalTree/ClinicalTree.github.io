## Rationale and Objectives

Total renal volume (TRV) is an important quantitative indicator of the progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The Consortium for Radiologic Imaging Studies of Polycystic Kidney Disease proposes a method for TRV computation based on manual tracing and geometric modeling. Alternative approaches for TRV computation are represented by the application of advanced image processing techniques. In this study, we aimed to compare TRV estimates derived from these two different approaches.

## Materials and Methods

The nearly automated technique for the analysis of magnetic resonance (MR) images was tested on 30 ADPKD patients. TRV was computed from both axial (KV  ax ) and coronal (KV  cor ) acquisitions and compared to measurements based on geometric modeling (KV  ap ) by linear regression and Bland–Altman analysis. In addition, to assess reproducibility, intraobserver and interobserver variabilities were computed.

## Results

Linear regression analysis between KV  ax and KV  cor resulted in an excellent correlation (KV  ax = 1KV  cor − 0.78; _r_ 2 = 0.997). Bland–Altman analysis showed a negligible bias and narrow limits of agreement (bias: −11.7 mL; SD: 54.3 mL). Similar results were obtained by comparison of volumes obtained applying the nearly automated method and the one based on geometric modeling ( _y_ = 0.98 _x_ \+ 75.9; _r_ 2 = 0.99; bias: −53.7 mL; SD: 108.1 mL). Importantly, geometric modeling does not provide reliable TRV estimates in huge kidney affected by regional deformation. Intraobserver and interobserver variability resulted in very small percentage error <2%.

## Conclusions

The results of this study provide the feasibility of using a nearly automated approach for accurate and fast evaluation of TRV also in markedly enlarged ADPKD kidneys including exophytic cysts.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common life-threatening genetic disease . In almost 50% of patients with ADPKD, the disease progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or transplantation. The progression rate of ADPKD to ESRD is variable, and the mechanism of chronic renal failure in ADPKD is not yet clearly defined. A proposed hypothesis is that growth of cysts leads to renal failure by compressing adjacent normal parenchyma . Cysts initiation begins early in life in a relatively few renal tubules that expand; as cysts become more numerous and enlarged expanding the total cyst volume (TCV), the total renal volume (TRV) increases. Consequently, cysts growth represents the major determinant of TRV increase in ADPKD . Importantly, in polycystic disease, TRV is associated with proteinuria and directly correlated with the reduction in glomerular filtration rate, and it is considered a predictive marker of the chronic renal failure development .

The publication of a large clinical trial on the use of tolvaptan and some preliminary data on analogs of somatostatin give to the scientific and patients' community the hope for a possible therapeutic strategy of slowing the progression of the disease in the next future.
