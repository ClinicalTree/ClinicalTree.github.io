_Diagnostic Imaging: Oncology_ is a new print and electronic reference textbook covering the most up-to-date collection of staging and imaging information for cancers of the entire human body. The book contains more than 3050 images with detailed charts and reference tables providing easy access to TNM and American Joint Committee on Cancer prognostic groups. The companion online Amirsys eBook Advantage provides many additional annotated images for oncologic imaging.

The textbook offers an organized format for cancers in the head and neck, thorax, breast, gastrointestinal system, genitourinary system, gynecologic sites, and musculoskeletal sites, as well as systemic malignancies. Each chapter specific to a cancer provides rich illustrations, bulleted text with pertinent information, and reference tables to get a better sense of how certain tumors behave. The sections on colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lymphoma are particularly well annotated and illustrated. I found this textbook extremely helpful for understanding routes of tumor spread, imaging techniques for local staging, and treatment options, all in one comprehensive reference. All the images in the book are well annotated to maximize their illustrative potential. The table of contents is instrumental in making the most optimal use of this reference text.

I find _Diagnostic Imaging: Oncology_ useful for general practicing radiologists, body imaging fellows, oncologists, internists, and other practitioners interested in the understanding of oncology. As recently as the 2010 annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, this textbook was considered the best seller of the _Diagnostic Imaging_ series. The entire textbook (and more) is searchable online with a unique eBook Advantage online code obtained upon purchase. This allows storage online for always up-to-date images, information, and staging criteria in oncologic imaging. The eBook Advantage is a unique feature of this reference text series that allows owners to register their copies and easily search for images and captions online in a similar format as the hardcover text. The online companion offers numerous additional images not found in the book. The reference hardcover text can be burdensome to carry around, and having the online eBook Advantage tool always available is a quite welcome feature in this series.

_Diagnostic Imaging: Oncology_ is a fantastic addition to the wonderful _Diagnostic Imaging_ series of beautifully illustrated and well-organized reference textbooks designed specifically to help radiologists and clinicians reach reliable conclusions in a practical, easy-to-use, “go-to” reference. Outstanding color graphics in this book illustrate the pathologic anatomy and high-quality radiologic images of various cancers of the entire body. This is an outstanding comprehensive reference on oncologic imaging that will help radiologists and oncologists become familiar with the myriad appearances and behaviors of various cancers.
