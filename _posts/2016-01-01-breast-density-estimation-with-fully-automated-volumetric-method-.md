## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of our study was to calculate mammographic breast density with a fully automated volumetric breast density measurement method and to compare it to breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) breast density categories assigned by two radiologists.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 476 full-field digital mammography examinations with standard mediolateral oblique and craniocaudal views were evaluated by two blinded radiologists and BI-RADS density categories were assigned. Using a fully automated software, mean fibroglandular tissue volume, mean breast volume, and mean volumetric breast density were calculated. Based on percentage volumetric breast density, a volumetric density grade was assigned from 1 to 4.

## Results

The weighted overall kappa was 0.895 (almost perfect agreement) for the two radiologists' BI-RADS density estimates. A statistically significant difference was seen in mean volumetric breast density among the BI-RADS density categories. With increased BI-RADS density category, increase in mean volumetric breast density was also seen ( _P_ < 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between BI-RADS categories and volumetric density grading by fully automated software (ρ = 0.728, _P_ < 0.001 for first radiologist and ρ = 0.725, _P_ < 0.001 for second radiologist). Pairwise estimates of the weighted kappa between Volpara density grade and BI-RADS density category by two observers showed fair agreement (κ = 0.398 and 0.388, respectively).

## Conclusions

In our study, a good correlation was seen between density grading using fully automated volumetric method and density grading using BI-RADS density categories assigned by the two radiologists. Thus, the fully automated volumetric method may be used to quantify breast density on routine mammography.

## Introduction

Mammography is the recommended screening method for breast cancer in the general population . However, the sensitivity of screening mammography is reduced in women with dense breasts because of obscuration of underlying lesion by dense and heterogenous breast tissue. Because of this, chances of missing breast cancer are increased . At the same time, increased breast density has been considered as an independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer. Various studies have shown that women with high breast density compared to women with low breast density are four to six times more likely to get breast cancer . Bertrand et al. reported that women with breast density more than 50% have approximately twofold risk of developing breast cancer than women with breast density of 11–23%. The authors also reported a positive correlation between breast density and larger tumor size, positive lymph nodes, and negative estrogen receptor status .

The American College of Radiology (ACR) recommends annual screening mammography in women more than 40 years of age. However, in a subset of population having increased risk for breast cancer, ACR not only recommends screening at earlier age but also emphasizes the need of supplemental screening methods like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging . ACR has also recommended supplemental screening in women with genetic predisposition to the disease and in women with dense breasts . Thus, breast density determines the need for supplemental screening and can prove to be an important factor in risk stratification.
