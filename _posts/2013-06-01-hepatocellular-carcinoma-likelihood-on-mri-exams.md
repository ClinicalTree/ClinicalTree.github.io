## Purpose

Evaluate the reliability and validity of a standardized reporting system designed to improve communication between the clinician and radiologist regarding likelihood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Materials and Methods

The system assigns liver lesions into 1 of 5 categories of estimated likelihood of HCC: 1, <5%; 2, 5%–20%; 3, 21%–70%; 4, 71%–95%; 5, >95%. Six American Board of Radiology–certified radiologists reviewed 100 abdominal MRI studies (performed between September 2009 and June 2010 for HCC surveillance) blinded to the official reports and clinical information. Each reader recorded the highest category (1–5) assigned to any lesion per study. Reliability between readers was calculated by the Shrout-Fliess random sets intraclass correlation (ICC). To examine validity, original pretransplant reports from January 2009 to December 2010 were compared to pathology reports on liver explants. Sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were then produced.

## Results

The ICC for retrospective readings was 0.80, indicating very good reliability. Of 45 pathologically proven cases, 16 category 1 or 2 cases were all free of HCC (negative predictive value 100%). Five of nine category 3 cases contained HCC. Six of eight category 4 cases contained HCC (PPV 75%). All 12 category 5 cases contained HCC (positive predictive value 100%). The area underneath the ROC curve was 0.949. If categories 1 and 2 are considered negative and categories 3–5 considered positive, this achieves 100% sensitivity with 73% specificity.

## Conclusion

This standardized system for reporting likelihood of HCC, which is a forerunner of the recently introduced Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System, produces strong reliability and validity, while aiming to improve the clarity of clinical magnetic resonance imaging reports.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The incidence of HCC in the United States has tripled from 1975 to 2005 . Certain high-risk populations for HCC typically undergo imaging surveillance at annual or biannual intervals, including patients with chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C), alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. No universally accepted imaging surveillance algorithm exists, but some studies suggest that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound in both sensitivity and specificity for the detection of HCC . The size and number of HCCs determines treatment decisions, including eligibility for liver transplant .

Imaging is recognized as a valid alternative to biopsy for diagnosing HCC . When imaging is considered diagnostic, biopsy is usually not performed because of reports of seeding the biopsy tract with tumor and other occasional complications . However, when imaging findings are inconclusive, biopsy or short-interval follow-up may be recommended. Therefore, it is important to accurately communicate the radiologist's confidence in a diagnosis of possible or definite HCC. Ambiguous terms in clinical MRI reports such as “suspicious of,” “concerning for,” and “possibility of” convey no consistent information to physicians interpreting the report, at best leading to requests for further clarification, which in turn slow down workflow and productivity. At worst, this misinterpretation can lead to mismanagement of a potentially treatable and/or curable disease. In fact, physician-to-physician communication errors are frequently cited as one of the most common causes of medical errors and it is one of the top five indications for medical malpractice in radiology .
