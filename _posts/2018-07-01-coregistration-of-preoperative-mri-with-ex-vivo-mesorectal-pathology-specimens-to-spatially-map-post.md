## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to develop and quantitatively evaluate a radiology-pathology fusion method for spatially mapping tissue regions corresponding to different chemoradiation therapy-related effects from surgically excised whole-mount rectal cancer histopathology onto preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

This study included six subjects with rectal cancer treated with chemoradiation therapy who were then imaged with a 3-T T2-weighted MRI sequence, before undergoing mesorectal excision surgery. Excised rectal specimens were sectioned, stained, and digitized as two-dimensional (2D) whole-mount slides. Annotations of residual disease, ulceration, fibrosis, muscularis propria, mucosa, fat, inflammation, and pools of mucin were made by an expert pathologist on digitized slide images. An expert radiologist and pathologist jointly established corresponding 2D sections between MRI and pathology images, as well as identified a total of 10 corresponding landmarks per case (based on visually similar structures) on both modalities (five for driving registration and five for evaluating alignment). We spatially fused the in vivo MRI and ex vivo pathology images using landmark-based registration. This allowed us to spatially map detailed annotations from 2D pathology slides onto corresponding 2D MRI sections.

## Results

Quantitative assessment of coregistered pathology and MRI sections revealed excellent structural alignment, with an overall deviation of 1.50 ± 0.63 mm across five expert-selected anatomic landmarks (in-plane misalignment of two to three pixels at 0.67- to 1.00-mm spatial resolution). Moreover, the T2-weighted intensity distributions were distinctly different when comparing fibrotic tissue to perirectal fat (as expected), but showed a marked overlap when comparing fibrotic tissue and residual rectal cancer.

## Conclusions

Our fusion methodology enabled successful and accurate localization of post-treatment effects on in vivo MRI.

## Introduction

Of the 40,000 patients diagnosed with rectal cancer in 2016 , most underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy before surgery. However, histopathologic analysis of the postsurgical specimens reveals that up to 27% of these patients had pathologic complete response to treatment , indicating they could have potentially avoided aggressive surgery. Current preoperative standard-of-care assessment is primarily based on T2-weighted (T2w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of treatment response and extent of tumor regression in vivo. Radiologists attempt to restage the tumor based on visual differences in grayscale contrast of soft tissue regions within and around the rectum. Although fibrotic tissue and rectal cancer may be different from a physiological perspective (different T2 relaxation times) , regions of benign treatment effects such as fibrosis, inflammation, and mucin pools typically have indistinguishable intensities from residual cancer on T2w MRI (  Fig 1 ) . Thus, experts tend to struggle in identifying patients with complete response (no residual disease and only fibrosis) via MRI, leading to possible overstaging in patients with rectal cancer .

![Figure 7, Side-by-side violin plots comparing T2w signal intensity distributions from the fibrosis region ( red ) and rectal cancer ( green ) to the perirectal fat region ( blue ) across all patients. The fibrosis region appears to have a signal intensity that is markedly different from that in the fat region, reflective of the accuracy in spatially mapping the pathology annotations onto the T2w images. This difference in signal intensities appears to be harder to discriminate in cases of poor response to treatment ( extreme right ) compared to complete response to treatment ( extreme left ). Additionally, the spatially mapped rectal cancer and fibrotic tissue annotations exhibit overlapping T2w signal intensity distributions, reflecting their overlapping visual appearance on T2w MRI.
