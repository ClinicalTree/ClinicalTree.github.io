We thank Dr Segall for his thoughtful comments and appreciate the opportunity to respond. Because our survey was conducted during the 2013–2014 academic year, the American Board of Radiology (ABR), like the American Board of Nuclear Medicine (ABNM), has relaxed the requirement that 10 of the 16 months of training in nuclear medicine be consecutive. To clarify, our statement regarding preference for ABR Nuclear Radiology versus ABNM is based on the survey data presented in Table 4 and refers only to those programs adopting or considering adopting the 16-month or an alternative pathway.
