## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to evaluate the automatic detection of the papillary muscle and to determine its influence on quantitative left ventricular (LV) mass assessment.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight Yorkshire-Landrace swine and 10 volunteers underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) of the left ventricle. The variability in measurements of LV papillary muscles traced automatically and manually were compared to intra- and interobserver variabilities. CMR-derived LV mass with the papillary muscle included or excluded from LV mass measurements was compared to true mass at autopsy of the Yorkshire-Landrace swine.

## Results

Automatic LV papillary muscle mass from all subjects correlated well with manually derived LV papillary muscle mass measurements ( _r_ = 0.84) with no significant bias between both measurements (mean difference ± SD, 0.0 ± 1.5 g; _P_ = .98). The variability in results related to the contour detection method used was not statistically significant different compared to intra- and interobserver variabilities ( _P_ = .08 and _P_ = .97, respectively). LV mass measurements including the papillary muscle showed significantly less underestimation (−10.6 ± 7.1 g) with the lowest percentage variability (6%) compared to measurements excluding the papillary muscles (mean underestimation, −15.1 ± 7.4 g percentage variability, 7%).

## Conclusion

The automatic algorithm for detecting the papillary muscle was accurate with variabilities comparable to intra- and interobserver variabilities. LV mass is determined most accurately when the papillary muscles are included in the LV mass measurements. Taken together, these observations warrant the inclusion of automatic contour detection of papillary muscle mass in studies that involve the determination of LV mass.

The measurements of left ventricular (LV) function by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) are accurate and reproducible compared to those obtained through other imaging modalities ( ). Measurement of LV mass by CMR is also highly reproducible, but both significant underestimation and overestimation in comparison with LV mass at autopsy have been reported ( ). In previous CMR studies of LV mass, the papillary muscles were typically excluded because the manual tracing required to measure these complex structures is time consuming. Recent improvements in CMR sequences have increased both the resolution and contrast ratios, making it easier to distinguish between blood pool and muscle ( ). As a result, the papillary muscles are presently easier to identify. These improvements in CMR combined with modern analysis software allow automatic identification of papillary muscle, within a short time frame. This study compares the in vivo measurement of LV papillary muscle mass using automatically drawn contours on CMR scans with those obtained manually as well as with ex vivo LV mass measurements at autopsy.

## Materials and methods

## Animals

Twenty-eight Yorkshire-Landrace swine (35–50 kg) were sedated with 20 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg midazolam intramuscularly, anesthetized with 12 mg/kg thiopental intravenously, intubated, and mechanically ventilated with a 1:2 mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl (12.5 μg/kg/hour). All 28 swine underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were sacrificed the next day. Subsequently, the heart was removed and the left ventricle was isolated by dissecting out the mitral and aortic valves, atria, and right ventricle. Experiments complied with _The Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals_ of the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 86-23, revised 1996) and were approved by the Erasmus Medical Center Animal Care Committee.
