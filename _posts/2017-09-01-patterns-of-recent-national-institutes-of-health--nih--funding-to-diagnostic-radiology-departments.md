## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to characterize recent National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding for diagnostic radiology departments at US medical schools.

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective study did not use private identifiable information and thus did not constitute human subjects research. The public NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditure and Results system was used to extract information regarding 887 NIH awards in 2015 to departments of “Radiation-Diagnostic/Oncology.” Internet searches were conducted to identify each primary investigator (PI)'s university web page, which was used to identify the PI's departmental affiliation, gender, degree, and academic rank. A total of 649 awards to diagnostic radiology departments, based on these web searches, were included; awards to radiation oncology departments were excluded. Characteristics were summarized descriptively.

## Results

A total of 61 unique institutions received awards. The top five funded institutions represented 33.6% of all funding. The most common institutes administering these awards were the National Cancer Institute (29.0%) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (21.6%). Women received 15.9% of awards and 13.3% of funding, with average funding per award of $353,512 compared to $434,572 for men. PhDs received 77.7% of all awards, with average funding per award of $457,413 compared to $505,516 for MDs. Full professors received 51.2% of awards (average funding per award of $532,668), compared to assistant professors who received 18.4% of awards ($260,177). Average funding was $499,859 for multiple-PI awards vs. $397,932 for single-PI awards. Common spending categories included “neurosciences,” “cancer,” “prevention,” and “aging.”

## Conclusions

NIH funding for diagnostic radiology departments has largely been awarded to senior-ranking male PhD investigators, commonly at large major academic medical centers. Initiatives are warranted to address such disparities and promote greater diversity in NIH funding among diagnostic radiology investigators.

## Introduction

Grant funding is a key element of conducting successful radiology research, serving as an important resource for allowing more comprehensive or sophisticated investigations that otherwise may not be possible. For example, such funding can support the long-term development, testing, and dissemination of innovative new imaging technologies, whether relating to diagnosis or image-guided intervention . By far, the primary source of grant funding in the United States is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provided approximately $32.3 billion to support biomedical research in 2015 . Despite this large sum, receiving NIH funding is highly competitive, with only a small fraction of new NIH grant applications receiving funding , and many interested applicants unable to successfully secure such funding for their projects .

The amount of NIH funding to radiology departments has grown substantially since the creation of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering in 2000 . Further understanding of the characteristics of such NIH funding for diagnostic radiology would be useful in a number of respects. A knowledge of what are currently the most common awarding agencies, as well as the most commonly funded grant mechanisms and research topics, could help guide departments and investigators in framing applications with a higher likelihood of success . At the same time, insights into relatively underfunded areas could help highlight important deficiencies to be addressed, whether through targeted initiatives by the NIH itself or by other stakeholders . Moreover, awareness of disparities in the distribution of grants among departments and investigators could help inform efforts to promote greater diversity and inclusion in radiology research. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize recent NIH funding for departments of diagnostic radiology at US medical schools.
