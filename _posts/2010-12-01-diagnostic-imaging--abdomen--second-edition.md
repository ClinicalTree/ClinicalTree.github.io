The second edition of _Diagnostic Imaging: Abdomen_ is a comprehensive reference text on abdominal imaging, rich with images and medical illustrations. It follows the newly embraced format of Amirsys's _Diagnostic Imaging_ series of books. In this easy-to-read format, each clinical and radiologic entity is separated into subsections on imaging, clinical, pathologic, treatment, and differential diagnosis and presented in bullet-point format. It contains 3500 illustrations presented on 1100 pages for the current price of $339.

The authors of the book, Federle, Jeffrey, Woodward, and Borhani, are recognized authorities and educators in the field of abdominal and pelvic imaging, thereby ensuring a high quality of content. The book is distinguished from other radiology texts by its organization and format. The material is conveniently arranged and subcategorized to multiple tiers of reference. The book is separated into five parts, starting with abdominal manifestations of systemic conditions and followed by gastrointestinal tract and abdominal cavity, hepatobiliary and pancreatic, genitourinary, and retroperitoneal sections. Each of these parts is further separated into organ systems. For example, the section on the gastrointestinal tract and abdominal cavity is divided into sections on the peritoneum, mesentery, and abdominal wall; esophagus; stomach; duodenum; small intestine; colon; and spleen. Each of these sections is then further separated into subsections, which include narrative introductions and overviews, followed by congenital, infection, inflammation, metabolic, degenerative, vascular, trauma, treatment-related, transplantation, benign neoplasia, and malignant neoplasia sections.

The medical illustrations provided with the book are of high quality and are presented side by side with radiographic images, allowing for improved understanding of the pathology and imaging at hand.

eBook Advantage is a great new tool that was introduced with this edition. Readers can access all of the book's material online on Amirsys's Web site. This feature offers multiple benefits not available with the prior edition. eBook Advantage content can be accessed from anywhere in the world (reading room, plane, coffee shop, home, etc), preventing readers from being tied down to the 1100-page book and allowing for mobility of learning. The Web site also offers many additional cases not included with the printed version, providing more in-depth content. Although the printed edition is easily referenced, thanks to the reader-friendly format, eBook Advantage searchability provides an even easier reference source. Of note, nearly all the cases provided with the electronic version are available on the STATdx product of Amirsys. Hence, for those readers who already have STATdx subscriptions, eBook Advantage is not much of an advantage. Furthermore, STATdx subscribers may access most of the material available in this book online without purchasing the book. On the other hand, those readers who do not have STATdx access, eBook Advantage provides a much cheaper, one-time fee (included in the price of the book), access point to STATdx and Amirsys abdominal imaging content.

An additional change introduced with this edition is a short narrative introduction at the beginning of every section. The narrative is directed at trainee readers (medical students, radiologic and surgical residents, and fellows) and introduces readers to every organ section and the unique imaging characteristics associated with it. This introduction section adds a teaching element to the book in addition to its reference characteristics.

The content of the second edition was also updated with 150 new abdominal diagnoses. An additional emphasis is also placed on the imaging of the postoperative abdomen and transplantation. Additionally, the material was updated to account for changes in the field of abdominal imaging.
