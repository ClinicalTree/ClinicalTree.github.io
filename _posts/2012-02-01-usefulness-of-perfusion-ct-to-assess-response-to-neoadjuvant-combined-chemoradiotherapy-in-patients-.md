## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively evaluate perfusion computed tomography (CT) for assessment of changes in tumor vascularity after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in locally advanced rectal cancer and to analyze the correlation between baseline perfusion parameters and tumor response.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty patients with rectal cancer underwent baseline perfusion CT before CRT, and in 11 an examination after CRT was also performed. For each tumor, blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and permeability-surface area product (PS) were quantified. The Mann-Whitney U test compared baseline perfusion parameters of responders and nonresponders and pre- and post-CRT measurements were compared by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( _P_ < .05 statistically significant for both tests).

## Results

Baseline BF was significantly lower ( _P_ = .013) and MTT was significantly higher ( _P_ = .006) in responders. Both were able to discriminate responders from nonresponders with a sensitivity of 80% and 100% and a specificity of 73.3% and 86.7%, respectively, for BF and MTT. Baseline BV and PS were not significantly different in responders and nonresponders. Perfusion parameters changed significantly in post-CRT scans compared to baseline: BF ( _P_ = .003), BV ( _P_ = .003), and PS ( _P_ = .008) decreased, whereas MTT increased ( _P_ = .006).

## Conclusion

Baseline BF and MTT can discriminate patients with a favorable response from those that fail to respond to CRT, potentially selecting high-risk patients with resistant tumors that may benefit from an aggressive preoperative treatment approach.

The multidisciplinary management of rectal cancer patients has been witnessing a progressive change in the therapeutic approach of locally advanced tumors toward preoperative chemoradiation therapy (CRT), which is useful for tumor downsizing and downstaging, facilitating curative resection, decreasing the local recurrence rate, and improving patient survival . Tumor downstaging may lead to a partial or complete tumor regression, but in many cases, even if the tumor cell density is significantly decreased, the pathologic stage remains the same. The histological tumor response to the preoperative treatment can be assessed by the tumor regression grade (TRG), which may be determined according to different grading systems. One of them, proposed by Dworak et al, was specifically designed for application in rectal cancer .

Predicting which tumors will respond well to this therapeutic approach remains a challenge because morphological imaging criteria are unreliable in this regard . As it is becoming increasingly important that preoperative imaging may noninvasively select high-risk patients who could truly benefit from more aggressive multimodality treatment approaches in the preoperative setting , there is a growing interest on functional imaging techniques that can help monitor treatment effects. Both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have shown potential to act as functional biomarkers . Perfusion CT is able to assess vascular physiology within tumors retrieving information about tumor blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time (MTT), and vascular permeability-surface area product (PS) . These parameters reflect vascular changes occurring in neoplastic tissue, ultimately related to the angiogenic process: BF reflects vascular supply to the lesion, BV reflects functional vascular volume, MTT reflects the time of blood through the tumor bed under the influence of vascular density, morphology and shunting, as well as interstitial pressure, and PS reflects leakiness of the microvasculature .
