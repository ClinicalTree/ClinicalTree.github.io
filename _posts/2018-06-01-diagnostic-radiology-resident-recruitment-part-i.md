To the best of our knowledge, there is little available organized advice for diagnostic radiology residency program directors and their programs regarding resident recruitment. We are a group of current and former program directors who are current vice chairs for education and continue to advise and to mentor many educators. We have constructed this article along the yearly schedule of trainee recruitment, including an application review, interviews, and troublesome trends that we have observed.

## Introduction

This work was performed by a subgroup of vice chairs for education in several radiology departments within the United States and meant to be a resource for diagnostic radiology (DR) residency programs and hopefully of use to interventional radiology residency programs as well. Some portions may also be of use to other graduate medical education (GME) training programs. This group of authors cumulatively has decades of program director (PD) experience, has reviewed many thousands of applications, and has interviewed thousands of candidates. We are either currently DR PDs or have recently served in this role and are a working group of Alliance of Directors and Vice Chairs of Education in Radiology (ADVICER) ; the opinions contained herein are ours and not necessarily that of ADVICER. The following is organized on the yearly application cycle and is not meant to be all-inclusive and is part 1 of a two-part series.

## Before the Interview Season Starts

## Communications

## Inquiries to programs and program directors before applying

Many applicants do not send an inquiry to the program or PD in advance of the application process. However, in some situations, this is not only commonplace but is also expected. For example, when a medical student participates in an away rotation in radiology, it is typical for the student to request to meet with the PD. As this expectation is not obvious to all students, it would be inappropriate to hold a lack of this request against a student. Usually, this request results in a brief “meet and greet.” Sometimes, students have a great deal to talk about, particularly if they come from an institution without a highly developed radiology advising system or if they are highly skilled at social interactions and are trying to “manage” the situation.

## Website

An online presence with an easily navigated website is an important source of information for potential applicants. As such, applicants may form their initial impression of the residency program based on website content . In their survey of 70 radiology residency candidates at the University of Arkansas, Deloney et al. found that the following 10 items were rated as “necessary” website content by at least 50% of survey respondents: “list of current residents (77%), list of faculty (69%), directions to hospital/department (66%), campus maps (59%), a description of the application process (57%), list of fellowships/jobs obtained by recent alumni (57%), recent/upcoming department/program changes and news (53%), interview dates and itinerary (51%), benefits and salary (50%), and the academic schedule (50%)” . A website can also be used to showcase innovative program and department initiatives, comments from current or former residents, and other features unique to the residency program or institution.

## Social media

Social media is increasingly being incorporated into medical education . GME programs also appear to be integrating social medial into their training programs to enhance online visibility . In a 2011 study of radiology PDs, Deloney et al. found that approximately 38% participated in electronic social media sites , and we suspect that an even higher percentage of PDs are currently participating in social media. In addition to highlighting information about the program and the department, some PDs are using social media to help screen applicants during the residency recruitment process . A review of the applicant's social media profile can result in a lower ranking of the applicant . Given the complexity and the visibility of issues related to social media, it is advisable to have intentional central control of content, approach, policy, and procedure when it comes to your department and your program.

## Offering Interviews

## Traditional (fourth-year US medical students) vs nontraditional (eg, non-US students and graduates with other training or experience) applicants

For programs, it is important to understand how their chair or GME office expects each program to respond to applications from these candidates.
