## Rationale and Objectives

Recently, the relevance of the postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1) Basic Clinical Year for radiology residents has been questioned. The purpose of this study was to determine the attitude of radiologists and trainees toward this year and which clinical rotations they perceived as most valuable to clinical practice.

## Materials and Methods

Following institutional review board approval, an anonymous online survey was administered to Canadian radiologists and radiology trainees. In addition to reporting demographic information, respondents were asked to rank the usefulness of individual rotations on a five-point Likert scale. To assess whether there are differences in the ratings and therefore rankings of the rotations by gender, position, and level of training, the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test was used with significance defined as _P_ < .05\. The Schulze method was used to rank the perceived usefulness of clinical rotations considered.

## Results

Of the 275 respondents, 73.1% were male and 47.3% were trainees. A total of 71.3% of respondents were in favor of the basic clinical year, whereas 16.4% opposed. There was a statistically significant difference between the responses of staff radiologists and trainees, with the staff more strongly favoring the Basic Clinical Year (84.1%) than the trainees (56.9%) ( _P_ < .0001). As a whole, the respondents favored general surgery rotations as most relevant to their clinical practice (agreement rate of 48.3%). Interventional radiologists found general and subspecialty surgical rotations to be equally relevant. The rotations deemed to be “essential” were emergency medicine (48.7%) and general surgery (46.6%), and the rotations deemed to be “very useful” were orthopedics (45.8%), trauma (44.4%), neurosurgery (43.3%), neurology (42.2%), and hepatobiliary surgery (38.9%). There was no statistical difference between the respondents' choices based on their level of experience and scope of practice.

## Conclusions

Most radiologists and radiology trainees were in favor of completing the PGY-1 Basic Clinical Year. However, programs should maximize the education value of this year by including more of the top-ranked rotations. As the practice of radiology evolves, it is important to ensure that training paradigms continue to prepare residents for independent practice.

## Introduction

The last decade in radiology has been defined by the introduction of new technology and increased specialization, which are reflected in resident education. Most recently, the subspecialty of Interventional Radiology has become its own direct entry residency program in the United States, altering the traditional training of radiologists. In Canada, although interventional radiology is now an accredited residency program, interested residents must first complete a diagnostic radiology residency . Residency programs must ensure that residents are adequately prepared to meet the current needs of clinical practice. One aspect of radiology residency training that has been under scrutiny is the postgraduate year 1 (PGY-1). The value of this year, as it is currently offered to residents, has been a topic of debate in the literature, with opponents arguing that it has no additional value to trainees and that more time should be spent focusing on learning radiology .

In North America, the first year of Diagnostic Radiology Residency training is the Internship or Transitional Year (United States) or Basic Clinical Year (Canada). In American programs, residents can select between a surgical and a medical internship; whereas in Canadian programs, this year is determined by the institution at which the resident will be completing their radiology training. American residents also have the opportunity to complete a Transitional Year, which is more similar to the Canadian Basic Clinical Year as residents rotate through several disciplines; however, most American radiology residents still opt to complete a traditional internship . In Canada, radiology programs were not responsible for this PGY-1 Basic Clinical Year until the introduction of the Canadian Residency Matching Service in the early 1990s . Since this time, the structure of the PGY-1 Basic Clinical Year for Royal College Specialty Programs in Canada has not significantly changed despite the evolution of the speciality during this same time . Given the rapid growth in radiology, it is important to evaluate the educational value of the PGY-1 Basic Clinical Year to ensure that trainees are receiving maximum value from their training programs. There have been no studies assessing the perceived educational value of the basic clinical year for radiology trainees.
