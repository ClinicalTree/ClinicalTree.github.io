Successful research results from the combination of multiple elements, including an appropriate research question, study design, research method, statistical analysis, and interpretation of results. One element of research that is easy to overlook is proper data collection and preparation for analysis. If data collection or preparation is inadequately planned or executed, the data may not be analyzable by a statistician without significant effort spent on data cleaning. Even worse, the data may contain problems that can be resolved only through time-consuming revision or repeat data collection. In this review, we present some practical guidelines and best practices for preparing data that can reduce the work of subsequent analysis.

## Introduction

onducting successful research involves the formulation of a clear research question, selection of an appropriate study design, selection of proper data collection methods and tools, data collection, data preparation, data analysis, and, finally, thoughtful interpretation of the results . Many books, courses, and articles offer information on study design and statistical analysis , but typically these resources provide little advice about data collection and preparation, which is the actual work that occurs between design and analysis. Without adequate planning for data collection and preparation, a project's data can easily become overwhelming to the point of obscuring the path to proper analysis. Even worse, the data may develop problems that require time-consuming revision or repeat collection.

Clinical research projects of even minimal complexity can still produce data that require statistical analysis beyond calculating simple means, standard deviations, and _t_ tests. More advanced analysis usually requires involvement of a statistician and dedicated statistical software, such as R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), Stata (StataCorp, College Station, Texas), SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina), and SPSS (IBM Corporation, Armonk, New York). It is most efficient to present data in a form that is directly analyzable by the statistician and an appropriate statistical software package. In times of limited availability, it may be difficult to find a statistician with time to correct a data set's formatting problems in addition to performing the actual analysis.

In this article, we present some best practices for data collection and preparation by researchers. These practices and pieces of advice are derived from our personal experience in advising many colleagues on statistical analysis for their research projects. In our experience, we have noted common problems and difficulties associated with data collection and preparation. In some cases, these problems have required costly additional time and/or resources to resolve. Fortunately, such problems can usually be prevented by observing some relatively simple practices. We focus on primary data collection by the researcher, but the techniques can be applied to secondary data analysis where the data were collected by someone else or extracted from another source such as an electronic medical record system.

We also draw from what we have learned from teaching several refresher courses on this topic at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. Since spreadsheets are the most common form in which data are presented to a statistician, we will present some valuable tips for their use. We will draw examples from one particular spreadsheet application, Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) because it is the most widely used application of its type and is nearly identical across multiple versions of both the Windows and Macintosh operating systems. However, most of our suggestions are applicable to any spreadsheet program, including open-source applications such as OpenOffice and Google Sheets. Although there are countless books and web resources detailing every feature of Excel, we will concentrate on a few specific essential features that make data collection easier for the clinical radiology researcher.

## Preparing to Collect Data

Because of intellectual excitement or time pressures, research projects are often started by delving directly into data collection. But before making the first spreadsheet, there are several important steps that should be taken to avoid unnecessary work and subsequent delays. The first and arguably most important step in data collection is formulating the research question. All research involves answering one or more questions, and these questions should be stated explicitly and prospectively . Defining the research question first is the best way to make sure all pertinent data are collected and that time is not wasted by collecting unnecessary information. One way to ensure that all pertinent data are collected is to identify all the important parameters that may affect the intervention or outcome being studied. Sources of clinical data are often difficult to access even once, so having to go back to collect a missed data element may be impossible. Modern computing technology places no practical limit on the number of data elements that can be collected, so relevance to the research question, not simply availability, should be the determinant of whether a data element should be collected. One must also remember that a statistically significant result still has a small probability of occurring by chance alone. A clear research question and purposeful data collection help to reduce the problem of a statistically significant result being interpreted as occurring only by chance.
