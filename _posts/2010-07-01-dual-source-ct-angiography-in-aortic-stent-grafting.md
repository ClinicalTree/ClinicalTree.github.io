## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of the study was to investigate the optimal protocols of dual-source computed tomography (CT) angiography in aortic stent grafting in terms of image noise and radiation dose, based on an in vitro phantom study.

## Materials and Methods

A series of helical CT cans were performed on a human aorta phantom using a dual-source CT scanner with kVp of 100, 120, and 140, corresponding mAs of 180, 150, and 100; slice thickness of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm; and pitch value of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively. Image quality was determined by measuring the standard deviation (SD) on three-dimensional virtual intravascular endoscopy (VIE) images. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured on two-dimensional (2D) axial images at superior mesenteric artery (SMA), renal arteries, and aneurysm. Effective dose was determined based on dose-length product.

## Results

SD measured on VIE images was independent of kVp and pitch values but was determined by the slice thickness ( _P_ < .05) at the SMA and renal arteries. SNR and CNR measured on 2D images showed significant differences between variable kVp values and slice thicknesses ( _P_ < .05), but were independent of pitch values. The mean estimated effective dose for 120 kVp and 140 kVp protocols were 2.66 ± 0.21 mSv and 2.68 ± 0.18 mSv, respectively. The mean estimated effective dose for 100 kVp protocol was significantly lower (1.97 ± 0.07 mSv, _P_ < .0001). This indicates a reduction of 26.5% radiation dose when the kVp was lowered from 140 to 100.

## Conclusion

A scanning protocol of 1.5-mm slice thickness, pitch 1.5 with 100 kVp, and 180 mAs is recommended for a dual-source CT angiography in aortic stent grafting as it leads to significant reduction of radiation dose while achieving diagnostic images.

Helical computed tomography (CT) angiography has been recognized as the preferred imaging modality for both preoperative planning and postoperative follow-up of endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) . The diagnostic value of CT angiography has been significantly enhanced with the recent development of multislice CT (MSCT) technique, beginning from initial 4-slice CT to 16-slice, and to the latest 64-slice, dual-source, or even more detector row CT scanners . Despite its advantages of MSCT angiography, the main concern is radiation exposure associated with the CT scans because radiation dose is gradually increased with the increased number of detector rows and reduction of detector size. Minimization of radiation exposure is of paramount importance for the patients treated with endovascular repair because these patients are normally followed with a series of CT scans during the rest of their life to check the position or integrity of aortic stent grafts and exclude any possible complications arising from the endovascular repair. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the strategies to reduce radiation dose while achieving diagnostic quality images in aortic stent grafting using dual-source CT scans, based on an in vitro aorta phantom study.

In particular, we were interested examining the relationship between image noise (defined as the standard deviation) visualized on three-dimensional (3D) surface rendered images, virtual intravascular endoscopy (VIE) of aortic ostium, as well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), which were measured on two-dimensional (2D) axial images acquired with variable scanning protocols. VIE has been previously reported valuable for assessment of the treatment outcomes of endovascular repair of patients with AAA . In this study, we applied the same methodology to perform a series of scans on the aorta phantom, but using the latest CT technique, dual-source CT. Because CT has become a routine imaging modality and more and more clinical centers are replacing older generation of CT scanners with the recent multislice CT models, it is expected that the study outcomes have practical applications for optimization of the MSCT scanning protocols in the daily clinical practice.
