## Rationale and Objectives

Stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of a heterogeneous group of patients with different prognoses. We assessed the prognostic value of baseline whole body tumor burden as measured by metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and standardized uptake values (SUV  max and SUV  mean ) of all tumors in nonsurgical patients with Stage IV NSCLC.

## Materials and Methods

Ninety-two consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Stage IV NSCLC who had a pretreatment F-18 fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan were retrospectively reviewed. The MTV, TLG, SUV  mean , and SUV  max of whole-body (WB) tumors were measured with the MIMvista workstation with manual adjustment.

## Results

There was a statistically significant association between overall survival (OS) and ln(MTV)/ln(TLG) at the level of WB tumor burden (MTV  WB ) and of primary tumor (MTV  T ). The hazard ratio (HR) for a 1-unit increase of ln(MTV  WB ) and ln(MTV  T ) before and after adjusting for age and gender was 1.48/1.48 (both _P_ < .001) and 1.25/1.25 ( _P_ = .006, .007), respectively. The HR for a 1-unit increase of ln(TLG  WB ) and ln(TLG  T ) before and after adjusting for age and gender was 1.37/1.37 (both _P_ = .001) and 1.19/1.19 ( _P_ = .001, .017), respectively. There was no statistically significant association between OS and ln(SUV  max ) and ln(SUV  mean ) at WB tumor burden, primary tumor, nodal metastasis, or distant metastasis ( _P_ \> .05). There was low interobserver variability between two radiologists with concordance correlation coefficients of 0.90 for ln(MTV  WB ) and greater than 0.90 for SUV  maxWB , SUV  meanWB , and ln(TLG  WB ).

## Conclusion

Baseline WB metabolic tumor burden, as measured with MTV and TLG, is a prognostic measurement in patients within Stage IV NSCLC with low interobserver variability. This study also suggests pretreatment MTV and TLG measurements may be used to further stratify patients with Stage IV NSCLC and are better prognostic measures than SUV  max and SUV  mean measurements.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the world and the second most common cancer in both men and women, and number one cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. In the United States in 2010, 157,300 people were projected to die from lung cancer, which is more than the number of deaths from colon and rectal, breast, and prostate cancer combined . Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) comprises 80%–85% of all lung cancer cases .

Stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) consists of a heterogeneous group of patients who are often treated with different modalities . Based on the comprehensive analysis of 67,149 patients with Stage IV NSCLC as defined by the 6th edition of the Union International Contra la Cancrum (UICC)/American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system for NSCLC enrolled in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the patients with distant metastasis have worse prognosis . The patients with tumor nodules on both sides of the chest have worse prognosis than those with separate ipsilateral tumor nodules in different lobes. The nodal status is a strong determinant of survival.
