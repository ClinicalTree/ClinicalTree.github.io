## Rationale and Objectives

Metastatic involvement of brain is rare in neuroblastoma (NB). We retrospectively evaluated conventional and advanced imaging and clinical findings of seven patients with secondary intra-axial brain NB metastases.

## Materials and Methods

Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography examinations of patients with metastatic brain NB were reviewed. Recent iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (  123 I-MIBG) scans were also reviewed. A medical record review was performed for relevant clinical, laboratory, histopathologic, and genetic data.

## Results

Mean age at the time of primary tumor diagnosis was 35 months, and all were considered high-risk NB at diagnosis. Mean time interval between diagnosis and brain involvement was 23.2 months. Extensive prior extra-central nervous system (CNS) disease was present in all patients, but concomitant extra-CNS disease at the time of brain involvement was absent in three (43%) patients. Various forms of disease, including intraparenchymal, intraventricular, and leptomeningeal lesions were detected.

Most intraparenchymal lesions were supratentorial and hemorrhagic; however, hemorrhage was absent in multiple leptomeningeal nodules in one patient. Contrast enhancement of lesions was present on all contrast-enhanced studies. Restricted diffusion of lesions was present in two patients. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion in two patients also revealed increased cerebral blood flow. Recent  123 I-MIBG scans were available in four patients and showed lesions in two patients with larger metastases but failed to demonstrate lesions in another two patients with smaller lesions.

## Conclusions

Brain metastases of NB are often supratentorial and hemorrhagic and demonstrate contrast enhancement. Diffusion-weighted imaging can show restricted diffusion. ASL images may reveal increased perfusion. MIBG scans may not show smaller brain metastases.

Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common pediatric extracranial neoplasm after leukemia. Metastases are present in up to 70% of patients with NB, frequently involving bone, bone marrow, and liver at the time of diagnosis and confer a poor prognosis. Metastatic involvement of the head and neck is also commonly seen both at presentation and recurrence and manifests most often as osseous metastases involving the calvarium, orbit, or skull base . However, metastasis to the brain (parenchymal, intraventricular, or leptomeningeal) is rare and a serious complication indicating poor prognosis . Recently, the survival of patients with advanced stage NB has improved because of novel treatment protocols that include aggressive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, autologous stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy . As life expectancy has increased, brain metastases may be diagnosed more frequently . A single-center study from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center revealed a low but increasing incidence of central nervous system (CNS) NB as a complication of stage IV metastatic disease and showed that CNS NB can be the sole site of disease recurrence in 64% of patients, and therefore CNS may represent a sanctuary site for NB . Some recent reports have also suggested that the incidence of CNS recurrence may be increasing , although the increasing incidence of NB metastasis has not been confirmed in all studies .

![Figure 1, Hemorrhagic intraparenchymal lesion in patient 2. Noncontrast brain computed tomography scan (a) revealed a large hemorrhagic intraparenchymal lesion with adjacent subdural hemorrhage. Axial T2-weighted (b) image reveals hypointensity in the lesion consistent with acute blood and surrounding vasogenic edema. Axial T1-weighted (c) image reveals foci of hyperintensity in the lesion. Histopathologic specimen following resection (hematoxylin and eosin stain) (d) reveals islands of malignant tumor cells ( arrows ) within a mass of hemorrhage. Apoptoses, mitoses, and rosettes are present. Tumor cells express synaptophysin (e) , NB84 (f) , and CD56 (g) markers, whereas the surrounding erythrocytes are negative.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImagingFindingsofPatientswithMetastaticNeuroblastomatotheBrain/0_1s20S1076633213005072.jpg)
