## Rationale and Objectives

To assess how well radiologists visualize relevant features of lesions seen with automated breast volumetric scanning (ABVS) in comparison to hand-held breast ultrasound in women going to breast biopsy.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five subjects were recruited from women who were scheduled to undergo a breast biopsy for at least one Breast Imaging–Reporting and Data System four or five lesion identified in a diagnostic setting. In this institutional review board–approved study, the subjects underwent imaging of the breast(s) of concern using a dedicated system that allowed both hand-held breast ultrasound and ABVS. Five experienced breast radiologists reviewed the 30 lesions in 25 subjects in a reader study. Each reader was asked to specify the lesion type, size, imaging features, Breast Imaging–Reporting and Data System, and suspicion of malignancy and to compare the lesion characteristics of shape and margins between the two modalities.

## Results

Seven (23.3%) masses were malignant and 23 (76.4%) were benign. Across all lesions regardless of size or final pathology, there was no significant difference in sensitivity or specificity ( _P_ > .15) between the two modalities. For malignant lesions, the reader visualization confidence scores between the two ultrasound modalities were not significantly different ( _P_ > .1). However, analysis for nonmalignant cases showed a statistically significant increase in reader visualization confidence in lesion shape and margins ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Radiologists showed increased confidence in visualization of benign masses and equal confidence in suspicious masses with ABVS imaging. This information could help decrease the need for additional hand-held imaging after automated whole breast ultrasound.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer in American women . Mammography remains the gold standard for screening women for breast cancer, but the major limitation of this technology is decreased sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue . Even with improvements in breast cancer detection using digital mammography, the sensitivity of mammography in women with dense breasts tends to be lower than the reported sensitivity of mammography in women with nondense breasts because of the added challenge of detecting breast cancers that may be obscured by overlapping breast tissue . This concept is known as “masking” . Unfortunately, masking is common in women with dense breasts. Dense breast tissue is found in 40%–60% of all women, of any age, undergoing mammographic imaging . Thus, this is a major contributing factor for the use of an additional screening modality to be used in conjunction with mammography. Ultrasound is one such tool that is being studied as a potential supplemental screening modality .

Ultrasound is an alternative technology that is not limited by breast density and has served as an important adjunct to mammography in the diagnostic evaluation of breast lesions for several decades. Although a highly sensitive imaging modality in breast cancer detection and evaluation, current ultrasound breast scanning technology requires a hand-held transducer. Evaluation is limited by the small hand-held ultrasound transducer size and to areas of the breast that are scanned. Thus, assessment is often deficient because the whole breast may not be evaluated by the operator. In addition, other limitations of conventional ultrasound are primarily because of operator-dependence and poor standardization of technique, which can result in missed cancers and unnecessary biopsies, additional medical expenses, and patient anxiety .
