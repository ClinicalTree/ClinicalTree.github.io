## Rationale and Objectives

Lymphoscintigraphy may be used for diagnosing secondary lymphedema. Dermal backflow, the presence of radiotracer in dermal lymphatics, is a key clinical feature. Although often reported as present or absent, a scale that assesses the severity of dermal backflow has been previously developed. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of these two methods of assessment.

## Materials and Methods

Sixteen experienced nuclear medicine physicians assessed the quantity of dermal backflow of 57 lymphoscintigraphy scans using a 4-point descriptive scale that was dichotomized for secondary analysis. Each scan included images from four time points for women previously diagnosed with secondary lymphedema ( _n_ = 47) and controls ( _n_ = 5); five scans were presented twice to examine intraobserver reliability. This was further investigated as 13 physicians viewed the scans again on an Apple iPad2. The physicians rated their confidence in their scoring. Readers were blinded to clinical history.

## Results

Although both the 2- and 4-point scale had moderate interobserver reliability, the reliability of the 2-point scale was slightly higher (4-point: Fleiss κ = .418, standard error \[SE\] = .008); 2-point: Fleiss κ = .574, SE = .013). Low interobserver reliability was found when only control subjects were considered (Fleiss κ = 0.055, SE = 0.034). Intraobserver reliability of the five repeated images varied from poor to perfect (Cohen κ = .063 to 1.00), whereas moderate to substantial intraobserver reliability (Cohen's κ = .342 to .752) was found when comparing devices. The readers were highly confident of their scores.

## Conclusions

Overall, moderate intraobserver and interobserver reliability was found for quantifying dermal backflow with both the 2- and 4-point scale.

Lymphoscintigraphy is a relatively noninvasive nuclear medicine technique used to investigate the function and anatomy of the lymphatic system . It is commonly conducted for sentinel node determination in the assessment of breast cancer or melanoma . It also can be used to assess the function and drainage patterns of peripheral lymphatics, aiding in the diagnosis and assessment of lymphatic disorders . In the setting of lymphedema secondary to treatment for breast cancer, lymphoscintigraphy has traditionally been considered the “gold standard” for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and has been used to predict the improvement from decongestive physical therapy , to stage the severity of the lymphedema , or to assist with decisions regarding surgical intervention .

Lymphoscintigraphy involves the injection of a radiotracer subcutaneously or subdermally into the affected and unaffected limbs. Typically with upper limb lymphedema, the radiotracer is injected into the webspaces of the hand, after which both upper limbs are assessed . While both quantitative and qualitative appraisals can be completed with lymphoscintigraphy imaging, the qualitative assessment of the morphologic features seen on the lymphoscintigraphic image is more frequently considered in a clinical situation . A number of key features are reported in the qualitative assessment, including the presence of lymph nodes, the symmetry of the lymphatic pathways, and the presence or absence of dermal backflow .
