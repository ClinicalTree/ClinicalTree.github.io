## Rationale and Objectives

This study examines the joint effect of several factors on radiology resident performance in the task of interpreting after-hours neuroradiology examinations.

## Materials and Methods

As part of a quality assessment process, we conducted a prospective evaluation of all ( _N_ = 21,796) after-hours preliminary readings of neuroradiology examinations performed by radiology residents over a 62-month period at our academic medical center. Each reading was scored by the interpreting neuroradiologist as “agree,” “disagree with minimal clinical impact,” and “disagree with significant clinical impact.” Coded resident and attending identities were also recorded for each case along with modality, body area studied, and the date of examination. These raw data were used to create an analytic data set with level of resident/attending agreement as the outcome and six predictors, including two date-derived variables: months 1–62 representing when the case occurred during the study and quartiles 1–4 accounting for the timing of the case in each resident's own experience. Cross tabulations, plots, bivariate statistics, and logistic regression were used to examine the relationships between study variables and the outcome (level of agreement).

## Results

Over about 5 years of the study, the absolute number of significant disagreements remained stable at about three per month. The total caseload increased at a rate of 4.1 per month with most of the increase falling into the agree category, whereas the minimal disagreements actually decreased slightly (0.2 per month). In the logistic model for disagreement, three of the factors accounted for most of the variance: attending (61%), resident (15%), and month (15%). Study type (modality and area examined) accounted for another 10%. There was no significant contribution from the variable (quartile) constructed to test for individual resident learning during the on-call experience.

## Conclusion

Although residents differ somewhat in the extent of attending agreement with their on-call work, evaluation or remediation made on the basis of simple comparison of these rates should be done with caution. Improved agreement over time seems to be a collective experience shared by residents.

Nearly a decade ago, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) developed the Outcome Project in response to an increasing demand for physician accountability. This project was implemented as a long-term initiative consisting of four phases, with progressive emphasis on educational outcomes in the residency education accreditation process. Phase 1 implementation occurred in July 2001 and included the introduction of the six general competencies into residency training. In Phase 2 (July 2002–June 2006), programs were required to demonstrate that they were teaching and assessing the competencies. We are currently in Phase 3 (July 2006–June 2011), and the requirements focus on measurable outcomes; that is, programs are now required to use outcome data as evidence for the continuous improvement of individual resident and residency program performance ( ). Graduate medical education programs can no longer simply state that they are training their residents to be qualified in the six general competencies; they have to provide evidence that supports this.

The challenge is to identify useful, reliable, and valid methods for assessing performance outcomes for each competency during graduate medical education training. Outcome proposals for the Patient Care competency in radiology residency include the documentation of reducing the discrepancy rate between the on-call preliminary resident radiologic examination interpretation and the final attending reading ( ). The assumption is that a reduction in this discrepancy rate reflects an increase in accuracy of the resident preliminary interpretation as the resident progresses through training. However, there are other factors to consider when making this determination, such as the variability of faculty interpretation, the percentage of abnormal examinations and change in volume of examinations over time, and the imaging modality and the anatomic site imaged.

![Figure 5, Individual resident percentages of agreement ( open circles , left y -axis) and associated odds ratios (ORs) for disagreement ( open triangles , right y -axis). The error bars on the ORs show the 95% confidence interval around the OR ratio point estimates. The reference resident (number 1) had the lowest percentage of agreement. Thus, the ORs represent the likelihood that any one resident had more (OR < 1.0) or less (OR > 1.0) disagreement than the reference. Note that all but three of the residents had no significant difference from reference because their error range includes 1 ( solid line ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/FactorsAffectingAttendingAgreementwithResidentEarlyReadingsofComputedTomographyandMagneticResonanceImagingoftheHeadNeckandSpine/4_1s20S107663320800144X.jpg)
