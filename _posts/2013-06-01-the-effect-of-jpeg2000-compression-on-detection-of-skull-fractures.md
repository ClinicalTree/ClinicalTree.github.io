## Rational and Objectives

To investigate the effect of the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG2000) 30:1 and 60:1 lossy compression on the detection of cranial vault fractures when compared to JPEG2000 lossless compression.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty cranial computed tomography (CT) images were processed with three different level of JPEG2000 compression (lossless, 30:1 lossy, and 60:1 lossy) creating three sets of images. These were presented to five musculoskeletal specialists and five neuroradiologists. Each reader read at two of the three compression levels. Twenty-two cases contained a single fracture; the remaining 28 cases contained no fractures. Observers were asked to identify the presence or absence of a fracture, to locate its site, and rate their degree of confidence. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC), jackknife free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) and the Dorfman-Berbaum-Metz multiple reader multiple case (DBM-MRMC) analyses were used to explore differences between the lossless and lossy compressed images.

## Results

JPEG2000 lossless and 30:1 lossy compression demonstrated no significant difference in their performance with JAFROC and DBM-MRMC analysis ( _P_ < .416); however, JPEG2000 30:1 lossy compression demonstrated significantly better performance than 60:1 lossy compression ( _P_ < .016). A significant increase in misplaced confidence ratings was also seen with 60:1 ( _P_ < .037) over 30:1 lossy and lossless compression.

## Conclusion

JPEG2000 60:1 compression degrades the detection of skull fractures significantly while increasing the confidence with which readers rate fractures compared with 30:1 lossy and lossless compression. JPEG2000 30:1 lossy compression does not significantly change performance when compared to JPEG2000 lossless for the detection of skull fractures on CT.

Increasing volumes of data generated by medical imaging is a problem for image storage, management, transmission, and display . Data compression is a possible solution to this problem but it has limitations. Compression can be performed in a lossless, reversible manner, where no information is lost. However, this only allows a 2:1 to 3:1 reduction in data size for medical images . On the other hand, compressing in a lossy, irreversible manner allows much higher levels of compression, but some information has to be discarded. At lower levels of compression, much of the discarded information is high-frequency uncorrelated noise, and image degradation is imperceptible to the human eye . At higher levels of compression, perceptible changes occur, though the image may still be acceptable for diagnostic use. The current study investigates how much compression can be tolerated in skull computed tomography (CT) before the diagnostic quality for detection of fractures is affected.

Previous studies have examined the effect of image compression on various imaging applications, for example, chest radiographs , musculoskeletal radiographs , mammograms , chest CT , abdominal CT , cerebral CT , nuclear medicine studies , and coronary angiograms . The tolerance of images to compression varies by modality and region and hence the acceptable compression threshold identified by these studies is varied. There are also several ways to define this threshold, such as quantitative metrics based on numerical assessment of pixel values before and after compression , the visually lossless threshold (the maximum compression at which the compressed image cannot be distinguished from the noncompressed image by a human observer) that is felt to be a relatively conservative threshold , and diagnostic accuracy.
