## Rationale and Objectives

With the impending integration of clinically relevant physics into the new American Board of Radiology Core exam, diagnostic radiology residency programs are faced with the challenge of how best to adapt the teaching of radiologic physics to residents. We present a novel resident-led physics curriculum that replaces the traditional didactic structure used in previous years. The hypothesis is that a self-teaching curriculum will facilitate greater retention of core physics concepts and foster a mentality of independent learning. We present both the implementation of this new curriculum and the initial outcomes.

## Materials and Methods

A 2-year resident-led physics curriculum was designed and implemented, with integration of the Radiological Society of North America/American Association of Physicists in Medicine online Physics Modules. A preimplementation survey was completed by residents to assess opinions on the previous lecture-based didactic curriculum. A postimplementation survey was then administered six months into the new resident-led curriculum. DXIT Physics percentile scores were compared before and after the curriculum change. The outcomes analysis of this study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and issued IRB approval #PRO13050022.

## Results

Average Physics DXIT percentile scores improved by 24.1% after the implementation of the resident-led curriculum. Results from the postimplementation survey reveal that 36% of residents think the change was a “Significant Improvement” in physics education. Also, 50% of responses have rated the new curriculum as “Moderately” effective, and an additional 13% of responses have rated the curriculum as “Very-to-Extremely” effective in teaching physics.

## Conclusions

Compared to our prior lecture-based physics curriculum, the change to a resident-led physics curriculum, to teach clinically relevant physics concepts to radiology residents, has been both effective and well received.

A sound foundation in radiologic physics is essential to understanding imaging technology. Since its inception in 1934, the American Board of Radiology (ABR) has affirmed the importance of physics in its certifying exams. Physics certification first took the form of a dedicated oral physics examination and was eventually transitioned to a written physics examination in 1969. This written physics exam was initially administered during the fourth year of training, but 30 years later, in an effort to provide greater flexibility, testing was permitted following the first year of training. The vast majority of programs soon promoted testing at the earliest opportunity. This more progressive timeline had the inevitable consequence of permitting certification before a trainee encountered the actual physics concepts clinically .

Anecdotally, for many residents, physics education is often perceived as irrelevant or simply as a hurdle to be crossed and forgotten. Partially to combat this trend, the ABR will alter its process of certification again in 2013 when the written exam is assimilated into the new ABR Core examination. This exam replaces the written and oral exams with a single, image-rich computer exam spanning 18 competencies of radiology. Physics principles have been incorporated into clinical imaging scenarios throughout the exam . Furthermore, physics concepts will now be stressed during the Maintenance of Certification exams, taken throughout every radiologist's career.
