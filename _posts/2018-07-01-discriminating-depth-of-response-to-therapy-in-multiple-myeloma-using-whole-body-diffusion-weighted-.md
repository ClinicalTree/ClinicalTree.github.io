## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to measure apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma by whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI MRI) and assess the diagnostic accuracy of ADC in the discrimination of deep response to induction chemotherapy.

## Materials and Methods

Seventeen patients underwent WB-DWI MRI before and after induction chemotherapy (week 20). DWI images and ADC maps were produced and 89 regions of interest were chosen. ADC percent changes were compared between deep (complete response or very good partial response) and non–deep responders (partial response, minimal response, stable disease, or progressive disease) as International Myeloma Working Group criteria. Diagnostic accuracy of ADC was calculated using specific cut offs. Predictive positive value of ADC was calculated to predict deep response to consolidation therapy.

## Results

Lesions reduced in size and number and signal intensity decreased in follow-up DWI, which did not differ between deep and non–deep responders. ADC percent changes were significantly higher in deep responders (36.79%) than in non–deep responders (11.50%) after induction therapy ( _P_ = .02) in per lesion analysis. ADC percent increases by 46.96%, 78.0% yielded specificity at 81.4%, 90.7% in discriminating deep response to induction therapy. Predictive positive value predicting deep response to consolidation therapy was 60.5% by using ADC cutoff >1.00 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s at week 20.

## Conclusions

ADC from WB-DWI MRI increased remarkably in patients who achieved deep response at the end of induction chemotherapy, which represented a confirmatory diagnostic tool to discriminate deep response to induction therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. ADC may have a potential to predict deep response to consolidation therapy.

## Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells, which may produce excessive amounts of monoclonal immunoglobulins. MM accounts for 10%–15% of all hematologic malignancies and results in 15%–20% deaths . With the introduction of novel therapeutics including immunomodulatory agents (thalidomide, lenalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), the prognosis of patients with MM has significantly improved. Recent studies have confirmed the significance of deep response particularly complete response (CR) or very good partial response (VGPR) to induction therapy for patients with newly diagnosed MM .

On the other hand, methods for evaluating treatment response still remain scarce and existing ones have limitations. Serum or urine measurements (M-proteins, free light chain) are part of clinical assessment but lack reliability in non-secretory MM. Bone marrow biopsy is invasive, and sampling errors may occur because of scattered bone lesions . Conventional radiographs provide morphologic information and are still the primary choice for response assessment and follow-up in MM . However, functional changes in lytic bone lesions cannot easily be captured by conventional radiology, even after an effective therapy , causing difficulty in the discrimination of treatment response in MM. More advanced techniques, including positron emission tomography-computed tomography, may be clinically limited by higher cost and radiation exposure.
