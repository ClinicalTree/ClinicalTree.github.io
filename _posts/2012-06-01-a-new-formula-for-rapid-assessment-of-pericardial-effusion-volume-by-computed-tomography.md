## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate a new formula for the rapid assessment of pericardial effusion (PE) volume by computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty computed tomographic scans positive for PE were reviewed by two observers. Diameters of PE were measured at four locations. Additionally, PE volume was assessed by volumetry. The correlation between PE diameters and volume was evaluated, and a linear equation was derived for each diameter location. To test validity and reliability of the measurements, intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman analysis were performed.

## Results

Good validity was expressed by strong correlations between diameter measurements at all four locations and PE volume (all _R_ values >0.80 and _P_ values <.0001). Intraclass correlation (all coefficients >0.75) and Bland-Altman analysis revealed good interobserver and intraobserver reliability of diameter measurements. The best values were observed for apical diameter measurements. The following linear equation was derived for apical diameter measurements: PE volume = 296 (mL/cm) × apical diameter (cm) − 32 mL.

## Conclusions

PE volume can rapidly be assessed by apical PE diameter measurement using the simplified formula PE volume = 0.3 (L/cm) × apical diameter (cm).

The heart is surrounded by the pericardium, which consists of two layers. The outer layer is called the parietal pericardium and the inner layer the visceral pericardium . The space between the two layers, the pericardial cavity, normally contains a small amount of pericardial fluid, typically between 15 and 50 mL , which reduces friction within the pericardium by allowing the pericardial layers to glide over each other with every heartbeat. Abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pericardial cavity is called pericardial effusion (PE). The etiology of PE can be idiopathic, iatrogenic, metabolic, or caused by neoplasia, infection, or connective tissue disease . If a critical rate of pericardial fluid accumulation relative to pericardial stretch is reached, increasing intrapericardial pressure can lead to a severe decrease in cardiac function . This life-threatening condition is called cardiac tamponade. The critical pericardial fluid volume that leads to cardiac tamponade depends on whether the volume increases slowly or rapidly over time. Nevertheless, volumes of nonhemorrhagic effusions ranging from 300 to 600 mL have been reported to cause cardiac tamponade .

In certain patient cohorts, PE can be frequently detected as an incidental finding on computed tomographic (CT) examinations. For example, the incidence rate of PE in patients undergoing CT imaging of the pulmonary arteries for suspected pulmonary embolism ranges between 2% and 5% .
