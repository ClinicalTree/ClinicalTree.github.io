## Rationale and Objectives

Here we review the current state of multicenter radiology research (MRR), and utilize a survey of experienced researchers to identify common advantages, barriers, and resources to guide future investigators.

## Materials and Methods

The Association of University Radiologists established a Radiology Research Alliance task force, Multi-center Research Studies in Radiology, composed of 12 society members to review MRR. A REDCap survey was designed to gain more insight from experienced researchers. Recipients were authors identified from a PubMed database search, utilizing search terms “multicenter” or “multisite” and “radiology.” The survey included investigator background information, reasons why, barriers to, and resources that investigators found helpful in conducting or participating in MRR.

## Results

The survey was completed by 23 of 80 recipients (29%), the majority (76%) of whom served as a primary investigator on at least one MRR project. Respondents reported meeting collaborators at national or international (74%) and society (39%) meetings. The most common perceived advantages of MRR were increased sample size (100%) and improved generalizability (91%). External funding was considered the most significant barrier to MRR, reported by 26% of respondents. Institutional funding, setting up a central picture archiving and communication system, and setting up a central database were considered a significant barrier by 30%, 22%, and 22% of respondents, respectively. Resources for overcoming barriers included motivated staff (74%), strong leadership (70%), regular conference calls (57%), and at least one face-to-face meeting (57%).

## Conclusions

Barriers to MRR include funding and establishing a central database and a picture archiving and communication system. Upon embarking on an MRR project, forming a motivated team who meets and speaks regularly is essential.

## Introduction

Multicenter research studies are collaborative efforts between three or more medical centers. Although two centers may allow for external validation, once extended to three centers, findings may be more widely applicable to a given population. By leveraging larger and more diverse patient populations and sharing resources, multicenter studies offer many advantages over single-institution studies . Health-care practice guidelines based on value and appropriateness criteria require the strongest available scientific evidence for their validation. Performed appropriately, multicenter research studies can provide higher-quality research data than single-institution studies . Accordingly, multicenter research trial publications over the past decade have increased dramatically in all fields of medicine (  Fig 1a ).

![Figure 1, (a) Multi-institutional and multicenter publications between 1968 and 2016. PubMed search results with titles containing the words “multi-institutional” or “multicenter” demonstrate an increase in publications from 1968 to 2016 when including all medical specialties (biomedical literature from MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books) (search results circa September 2016). (b) Slower increase in multi-institutional and multicenter imaging publications between 1968 and 2016. PubMed search results of imaging-related publications with titles containing the words “multi-institutional” or “multicenter” demonstrate a slower rate of increase in this type of publication from 1968 to 2016 relative to other specialties (search results circa October 2016). Imaging journals included Radiology , Radiographics , American Journal of Roentgenology , American Journal of Neuroradiology , Journal of Ultrasound In Medicine , Magnetic Resonance in Medicine , Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging , Journal of Nuclear Medicine , Skeletal Radiology , Academic Radiology , Journal of the American College of Radiology , Abdominal Radiology , Emergency Radiology , Pediatric Radiology , Journal of Thoracic Imaging , Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology , and Medical Physics .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MulticenterResearchStudiesinRadiology/0_1s20S1076633217303379.jpg)
