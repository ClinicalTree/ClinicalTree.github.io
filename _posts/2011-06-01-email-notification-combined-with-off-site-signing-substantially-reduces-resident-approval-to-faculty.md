## Rationale and Objectives

Attending radiologist signature time (AST) is a variable and modifiable component of overall report turnaround time. Delays in finalized reports have potential to undermine radiologists’ value as consultants and adversely affect patient care. This study was performed to evaluate the impact of notebook computer distribution and daily automated e-mail notification on reducing AST.

## Materials and Methods

Two simultaneous interventions were initiated in the authors’ radiology department in February 2010. These included the distribution of a notebook computer with preloaded software for each attending radiologist to sign radiology reports and daily automated e-mail notifications for unsigned reports. The digital dictation system archive and the radiology information system were queried for all radiology reports produced from January 2009 through August 2010. The time between resident approval and attending radiologist signature before and after the intervention was analyzed. Potential unintended “side effects” of the intervention were also studied.

## Results

Resident-authored reports were signed, on average, 2.53 hours sooner after the intervention. This represented a highly significant ( _P_ = .003) decrease in AST with all else held equal. Postintervention reports were authored by residents at the same rate (about 70%). An unintended “side effect” was that attending radiologists were less likely to make changes to resident-authored reports after the intervention.

## Conclusions

E-mail notification combined with offsite signing can reduce AST substantially. Notebook computers with preloaded software streamline the process of accessing, editing, and signing reports. The observed decrease in AST reflects a positive change in the timeliness of report signature.

The timely provision of the final radiology report is a measure of professional quality in radiology. In fact, radiology report turnaround time (RTAT) is one of the standards regulated by accreditation organizations and cited in the American Board of Radiology’s Maintenance of Certification Practice Quality Improvement requirements . The American College of Radiology’s Practice Guideline for Communication of Diagnostic Imaging Findings states that “effective communication is a critical component of diagnostic imaging. Quality patient care can only be achieved when study results are conveyed in a timely fashion to those responsible for treatment decisions” . RTAT is one of multiple factors that contribute to timely communication. Delays in the availability of finalized reports have potential to negatively affect relationships with referring physicians, undermine radiologists’ value as consultants, and ultimately result in decreased quality of patient care .

The total time for the generation of finalized radiology results is dependent on a process consisting of multiple steps, starting with the initial request for a radiologic study and ending with the communication of the finalized radiology report to the referring physician. In an academic setting, a frequent intermediary step includes the dictation of a preliminary report by a trainee, which is reviewed, corrected, and then verified (signed) by the attending radiologist. The verification or signature time for an attending radiologist to edit and sign a finalized report can contribute significantly to RTAT, in some cases accounting for close to one third to one half of total RTAT . It is this segment of the report turnaround process over which faculty radiologists have direct control and can potentially modify. Therefore, time from resident approval to final attending radiologist signature was selected as the focus of our interventions.
