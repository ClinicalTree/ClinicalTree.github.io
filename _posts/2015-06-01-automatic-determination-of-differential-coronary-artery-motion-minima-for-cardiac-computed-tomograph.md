## Rationale and Objectives

Selecting the optimal phase for coronary artery evaluation can be challenging, especially at higher heart rates, given that the optimal phase may differ for each of the coronary arteries. This study aimed to evaluate a novel vessel-specific algorithm which automatically outputs the minimum motion phase per coronary artery.

## Materials and Methods

The study included 44 patients who underwent 256-slice cardiac computed tomography for evaluation of chest pain. End-systolic and mid-diastolic minimal motion phases were automatically calculated by a previously validated global motion algorithm and by a new vessel-specific algorithm which calculates the minimum motion for each of the three main coronary arteries, separately. Two readers blindly evaluated all coronary segments for image quality. Median scores per coronary artery were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

## Results

The variation, per patient, between the optimal phases of the three coronary arteries was 5.0 ± 4.5% (1%–22%) for end systole and 4.8 ± 4.1% (0%–19%) for mid diastole. The mean image quality scores per coronary artery were 4.0 ± 0.61 for the vessel-specific approach and 3.80 ± 0.69 for the global phase selection ( _P_ < .001). Overall, 46 of 122 arteries had a better score with the vessel-specific approach and five with the standard global approach. Interreader agreement was substantial ( _k_ = 0.72).

## Conclusions

This study has shown that multiple phases are required to ensure optimal image quality for all three coronary arteries and that a vessel-specific phase selection algorithm achieves superior results to the standard global approach.

Interpretation of computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) is usually performed on a single phase of the cardiac cycle. The optimal phase is usually selected empirically or with help of various automatic algorithms. However, it has been shown that the optimal quiet phase often differs for each coronary artery, especially at higher heart rates .

To avoid motion artifacts, CTCA image analysis is performed on the phase(s) with the least cardiac motion; however, there is currently no consensus concerning the selection of phases with the least cardiac motion. Several studies have attempted to determine the optimal cardiac quiescent phase , but definition of population-based quiescent phases is challenging because of high interpatient variability and significant heart rate dependency. Furthermore, the electrocardiographic (ECG) waveform by which CTCA acquisition is synchronized does not always adequately represent cardiac motion.
