## Rationale and Objectives

We evaluate utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to optimally fuse parenchymal complexity measurements generated by texture analysis into discriminative meta-features relevant for breast cancer risk prediction.

## Materials and Methods

With Institutional Review Board approval and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act compliance, we retrospectively analyzed “For Processing” contralateral digital mammograms (GE Healthcare 2000D/DS) from 106 women with unilateral invasive breast cancer and 318 age-matched controls. We coupled established texture features (histogram, co-occurrence, run-length, structural), extracted using a previously validated lattice-based strategy, with a multichannel CNN into a hybrid framework in which a multitude of texture feature maps are reduced to meta-features predicting the case or control status. We evaluated the framework in a randomized split-sample setting, using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) to assess case-control discriminatory capacity. We also compared the framework to CNNs directly fed with mammographic images, as well as to conventional texture analysis, where texture feature maps are summarized via simple statistical measures that are then used as inputs to a logistic regression model.

## Results

Strong case-control discriminatory capacity was demonstrated on the basis of the meta-features generated by the hybrid framework (AUC = 0.90), outperforming both CNNs applied directly to raw image data (AUC = 0.63, _P_ < .05) and conventional texture analysis (AUC = 0.79, _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Our results suggest that informative interactions between patterns exist in texture feature maps derived from mammographic images, which can be extracted and summarized via a multichannel CNN architecture toward leveraging the associations of textural measurements to breast cancer risk.

## Introduction

The stratification of breast cancer risk levels is becoming increasingly important and is rapidly evolving beyond the “one-size-fits-all” approach in breast cancer screening to personalized regimens tailored by individual risk profiling . Starting from the pioneering work of Wolfe , studies have consistently shown an association of the breast parenchymal complexity (ie, the distribution of fatty and dense tissues) on breast images with levels of breast cancer risk. In particular, full-field digital mammography (FFDM), which is routinely used for breast cancer screening , has demonstrated substantial potential in providing novel quantitative imaging biomarkers related to breast cancer risk. Mammographic density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer , while studies increasingly support significant associations of breast cancer risk with mammographic texture descriptors , which reflect more refined, localized characteristics of the breast parenchymal pattern.

In early studies investigating the role of mammographic texture in breast cancer risk assessment , textural measurements have been estimated within a single region of interest (ROI) in the breast. In an attempt to provide more granular texture estimates, more recent studies have proposed sampling the parenchymal tissue through the entire breast for subsequent texture analysis . For instance, in a recently proposed lattice-based strategy , each texture descriptor is calculated within multiple nonoverlapping local square ROIs through the breast, and texture measurements are then averaged over the breast regions sampled by the lattice. In a preliminary case-control evaluation , the lattice-based texture features were shown to outperform state-of-the-art features extracted from the retroareolar or central breast region, thereby suggesting that enhanced capture of the heterogeneity in the parenchymal texture within the breast may also improve the associations of texture measures with breast cancer risk. However, by averaging regional texture values, important information about the overall parenchymal tissue complexity might be still missed and, therefore, an improved fusion approach, which retains richer information about texture variability over the breast, might leverage the potential of such granular texture measurements provided by multiple ROIs.
