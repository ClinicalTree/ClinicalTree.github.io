## Rationale and Objectives

The advent of the ACGME's Next Accreditation System represents a significant new challenge for residencies and fellowships, owing to its requirements for more complex and detailed information.

## Material and Methods

We developed a system of online assessment tools to provide comprehensive coverage of the twelve ACGME Milestones and digitized them using freely available cloud-based productivity tools. These tools include a combination of point-of-care procedural assessments, electronic quizzes, online modules, and other data entry forms. Using free statistical analytic tools, we also developed an automated system for management, processing, and data reporting.

## Results

After one year of use, our Milestones project has resulted in the submission of over 20,000 individual data points. The use of automated statistical methods to generate resident-specific profiles has allowed for dynamic reports of individual residents' progress. These profiles both summarize data and also allow program directors access to more granular information as needed.

## Conclusion

Informatics-driven strategies for data assessment and processing represent feasible solutions to Milestones assessment and analysis, reducing the potential administrative burden for program directors, residents, and staff.

Medical educators have witnessed a sea change in resident assessment over the past 30 years. For most of the history of academic medicine, the determination of resident competency for independent practice was based on the subjective assessment of the academic faculty who trained them. Since the founding of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in 1981, resident education has experienced increasing structure, standardization, and accountability requirements with the goal to provide a more consistent level of quality in postgraduate training . Most recently, the ACGME has unveiled its Next Accreditation System (NAS) for resident education and introduced the concept of ACGME Milestones . Citing a public demand for greater accountability in medical education, these new standards strive to focus on outcomes, be learner centered, and prepare trainees for the evolving complexities of 21st century medicine . To accomplish these goals, the NAS and Milestones increase the granularity of information gathered on individual residents; the new standards require both frequent reporting of resident progress over time (every 6 months) and more detailed information about resident performance in the specific domains deemed critical to the practice of their chosen specialty.

In 2013, in collaboration with the American Board of Radiology, the ACGME established specialty-specific Milestones for Radiology , summarized in  Table 1 . Starting in July 2013, radiology residency programs have been required to gather data and provide summary reports for individual residents to the ACGME . In 2013–2014, approximately 64% of residency programs provided some form of feedback to their residents about their Milestones progress .
