This first edition of _Practical MR Physics_ fulfills a goal the author put forth a quarter century ago to write such a text. In my opinion, it was well worth the wait. In compiling an image-rich book in a case-based format, Dr Mamourian has created a resource that will prove invaluable to any radiologist who desires greater confidence in magnetic resonance (MR) image interpretation as well as those wishing to achieve a deeper understanding for the basis of MR imaging (MRI) artifacts and the means to minimize or eliminate them. (This review refers to the print version; a Kindle edition is available as well.)

The book is divided into four parts: a brief (40-page) overview of the physics behind MRI, a set of 27 cases (120 pages) exemplifying a variety of common MRI artifacts, a set of 24 cases (106 pages) that serve to highlight common “MR pitfalls” or findings that can mimic disease, and finally a set of 10 “puzzlers,” which are cases meant to challenge the reader by tying together concepts discussed throughout the book. Of note, the majority of the cases throughout the book are based in neuroradiology, which is the author’s imaging area of expertise. Consequently, those whose practice includes a significant component of neuroimaging will find the text most useful.

The book is image rich, with the vast majority (>75%) of pages containing one or more pictures, which aids in making it a high-yield read. Ironically, for a book that dedicates much of its content to imaging artifacts, the image quality is excellent. Each section ends with a selection of references for more in-depth reading. Links to online videos are provided throughout the first section, which help illuminate many of the physical principles behind MRI that are often difficult to explain with words or diagrams. The index proves useful for looking up examples of specific imaging artifacts.

The book’s first part serves as a brief discussion of MR physics that acts as a useful refresher for those who have a basic background in the subject (eg, a radiologist without a heavy physics background). In highlighting many of the major scientific discoveries contributing to the development of MRI, the author should be applauded for making a seemingly dry topic quite interesting. Although by no means exhaustive, upon finishing the section, the reader is prepared to tackle the concepts put forth throughout the remainder of the book.

The next section, “MR Artifacts,” presents common imaging artifacts seen on MRI exams through a series of 27 cases, each with an accompanying multiple-choice question and a brief (one to four pages) discussion. This is followed by the third section, “MR Pitfalls,” which is of an identical format but consists of 24 cases detailing findings consisting of anatomic variants, benign entities, or MRI artifacts that can easily be misinterpreted as pathology to the naive eye. The final section, “Ten Puzzlers,” is a series of 10 unknown cases each followed by a brief (about one page) discussion, which effectively summarize the concepts presented throughout the book.

Given the book’s image-based approach and concise explanations, it will serve as a useful resource for a wide range of radiologists. For residents and fellows, it will introduce new concepts that can have immediate application to their training, as many of these artifacts and mimics of pathology are encountered on a daily basis. Additionally, the book can serve as a useful adjunct to a general imaging physics text for those desiring further insight on specific MRI artifacts. For more experienced imagers, the book will help them gain a deeper understanding of how and why MRI artifacts occur and what can be done to minimize or eliminate them. I will keep it close at hand throughout my career.
