## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to quantify, using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, the microscopic rate of water diffusion in pure germinoma and to determine whether or not the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values correlated with the different histologic components.

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis of echoplanar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images was conducted on 10 patients with 11 germinoma lesions. All images were obtained using 1.5-T magnets with a b value of 1000 s/mm  2 . Regions of interest were drawn separately within the solid and the cystic or necrotic components of each germinoma, as well as within the normal gray and white matter of the respective cases, to calculate ADCs. The diffusion characteristics of the germinomas were assessed using mean and normalized ADC values. Histologic samples from all cases were blindly reviewed and then correlated with the ADC values.

## Results

Data are expressed as mean ± standard error. Evaluation of the solid components revealed that 36% of germinomas (4 of 11) had predominantly restricted diffusion (ADC  solid , 694.71 × 10  −6 ± 74.54 × 10  −6 s/mm  2 ; ADC ratio, 0.84 ± 0.07) compared to normal brain. The majority (55% \[6 of 11\]) had normal diffusion (ADC  solid , 947.64 × 10  −6 ± 54.38 × 10  −6 s/mm  2 ; ADC ratio, 1.14 ± 0.10). Only 9% (1 of 11) had increased diffusion (ADC  solid , 1172.30 × 10  −6 ± 48.52 × 10  −6 s/mm  2 ; ADC ratio, 1.67 ± 0.16). The cystic and necrotic components had a mean ADC ratio of 2.55 ± 0.25. There was no significant correlation between the histologic components and the ADC values of germinomas.

## Conclusions

The vast majority of germinomas demonstrated predominantly restricted (36%) or normal (55%) diffusion. The histologic components were not correlated with the ADC values.

Primary intracranial germinomas are rare tumors of children and young adults . They make up the bulk of central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors and account for approximately 0.06% to 2.24% of all intracranial neoplasms . Like other germ cell tumors, germinomas are situated in the midline, with the majority of lesions occurring in the pineal and suprasellar regions. Histologically, they are characterized by variable proportions of cellular sheets or lobules of uniform germinoma cells with large round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm interspersed by septal bands of connective tissue rich in capillaries, lymphocytes, and at times granulomas . Cystic degeneration and necrosis may be features of germinoma. Necrosis can be in the form of single cells, small microscopic foci, or in the most extreme cases, geographic zones.

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a vital role in the diagnosis of germ cell tumors . Diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging is a fairly recently developed MR sequence that has been used for the evaluation of neurologic diseases . With fast echoplanar technology, DW imaging has become widely clinically available and is part of the routine brain imaging protocol at our institution. It is highly resistant to motion, and imaging times are <30 seconds. DW imaging provides image contrast that is dependent on the molecular (Brownian) motion of water . The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a rotationally invariant measurement of the amount of total diffusion within a given tissue , and quantification of the degree of water motion requires ADC maps . The rate of molecular water diffusion as depicted on DW imaging may be altered in various diseases . Although DW imaging has had its major impact in the evaluation of hyperacute infarctions , it is assuming an increasingly important role in the evaluation of other intracranial pathologies, such as infections and neoplasms . DW imaging has been proposed as a mechanism for producing contrast in the demarcation of different brain neoplasms . Recent studies have demonstrated hyperintense DW imaging signal in certain primary CNS neoplasms, such as lymphoma, pineoblastoma, medulloblastoma, high-grade gliomas , and two germinoma cases . However, the single study that investigated germinoma included only two cases and did not report ADC signal or value. The purpose of this study was to quantify the diffusivity of germinoma as reflected by ADC values and to determine if the ADC values correlated with the various histologic components. We hypothesized that the ADC values would correlate with the different histologic components.
