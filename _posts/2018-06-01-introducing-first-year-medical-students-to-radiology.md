## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of our study were (1) to describe a new educational intervention for first-year medical students that gave a substantial, early exposure to radiology and (2) to examine how this early exposure was received by the students.

## Materials and Methods

Our new curriculum incorporated a new 2-week course very early in the M1 year entitled Foundations of Diagnostics and Therapeutics. Among other topics, the course included a substantial introduction to radiology primarily through small-group seminars and online materials, administered using a flipped-classroom approach. The students were given pre- and postcourse surveys that assessed the degree to which they felt prepared to learn about radiology, as well as their interest in radiology. Results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

## Results

Survey responses were obtained from 170 students before the course and 65 students afterward. Upon completing the course, students showed significantly increased academic interest in radiology ( _P_ = .008) and a heightened perception of the effect of radiology on patient care ( _P_ = .04), without a significant change in interest in pursuing radiology as a career. Students showed an overwhelmingly positive response to the course, although some noted that previous anatomy training would have been helpful. Eighty percent agreed or strongly agreed that the flipped-classroom structure was an effective educational model.

## Conclusions

Our study demonstrated that students were very excited to gain exposure to radiology early in their medical school curriculum, and such exposure led to an improved perception of the field.

## Introduction

Medical school curricula regularly undergo review and revision to stay current and relevant, a process necessitated by a growing body of scientific knowledge, evolving roles of medical providers, and expansion of technology within health-care delivery. The curriculum at the University of Michigan Medical School was recently revamped, enabling the inclusion of increased exposure to radiology, particularly in the first and second years of the 4-year program.

Traditionally, at most American medical schools, students do not receive significant exposure to radiology until their later clinical years, when they may enroll in an elective radiology rotation, as only a small number of schools have required medical imaging content taught by radiologists . However, previous research suggests that basic attitudes concerning radiology are created early in medical school and remain mostly unchanged throughout despite a later radiology elective . Furthermore, despite the increasing use of imaging for patient care, completing a rotation in radiology is required in only about 25% of US medical schools . Nevertheless, a majority of students express the desire to learn how to interpret radiographs and cross-sectional imaging studies . As the growing importance of and the desire for medical student proficiency in diagnostic radiology are recognized, there is much interest in the development of effective models for earlier and more robust incorporation of radiology within the medical school curriculum. This can be challenging, however, as radiology is an interdisciplinary subject, sitting at the intersection of anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and preclinical medical students may not have the background in these other related disciplines to appreciate the role of imaging.
