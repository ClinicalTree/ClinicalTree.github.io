## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is predominately influenced by CV risk factors and coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is capable of detecting early-stage coronary artery disease. We sought to determine the influence of CV risk factors on the prevalence of nonobstructive atherosclerosis in patients with normal-appearing coronary arteries in invasive coronary angiography (ICA).

## Materials and Methods

In this retrospective analysis, we included 60 consecutive symptomatic patients, having undergone ICA and coronary CTA. Coronary dual source CTA was performed using electrocardiogram-triggered retrospective gated image acquisition at 40%–70% of RR interval (tube voltage 100–120 kV, tube current time product 320–440 mAs, 60 mL contrast, and flow rate 6 mL/s).

## Results

Out of 60 patients (32 men, mean age 61 ± 11 years) with a normal coronary artery appearance in ICA, 45 (75%) patients showed atherosclerotic plaque in CTA. Plaque was present in 14 of 60 (23%) left main, 41 of 60 (68%) left anterior descending, 21 of 60 (35%) circumflex coronary arteries, and 24 of 60 (40%) right coronary arteries. More than 15% of all coronary artery segments showed detectable plaques. Interobserver agreement ranged from good to very good on a per-patient, per-vessel, and per-segment level. Patients with presence of plaque were significantly older ( _P_ = 0.005) and showed higher incidence of arterial hypertension ( _P_ = 0.019) as compared to individuals without coronary plaque in dual source computed tomography.

## Conclusions

The prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis by CTA is substantial in symptomatic patients with normal invasive coronary angiogram. Hypertension and older age significantly influence the prevalence of atherosclerotic plaque and highlight the importance of risk-modifying therapy.

## Introduction

Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors are widely used for risk assessment and direction of medical management in patients with suspected coronary heart disease. In patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD), strict risk factor control is crucial .

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) can detect coronary artery stenosis noninvasively with excellent diagnostic accuracy and hence is successfully used to predict prognosis . Importantly, not only obstructive CAD increases the risk of all-cause mortality. There are substantial data consistently demonstrating a significant increase in risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) with increasing burden of atherosclerotic disease in CTA . Clinical relevance to detect even small amounts of coronary artery calcification (CAC), for instance, has been demonstrated by the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), as individuals with CAC have significantly (threefold) increased risk for future cardiac events . It is also known that CAC has not only strong incremental value to predict cardiac events but also provides independent information in addition to traditional risk factors . The identification of nonobstructive, noncalcified lesions by CTA has also been shown to be of prognostic value . In 10,418 patients undergoing CTA, the international multicenter registry, CONFIRM, found a 6% higher risk of mortality for each additional segment with nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque ( _P_ = 0.021). Moreover, in patients with nonobstructive CAD, baseline statin use was associated with a 56% decreased mortality risk (hazard ratio 0.44) compared to patients without statin therapy. Statin use at baseline did not decrease the risk in patients without plaque in CTA .
