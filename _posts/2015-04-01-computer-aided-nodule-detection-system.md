## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the performance of a computer-aided detection (CAD) system with bone suppression imaging when applied to unselected consecutive chest radiographs (CXRs) with computed tomography (CT) correlation.

## Materials and Methods

This study included 586 consecutive patients with standard or portable CXRs who had a chest CT scan on the same day. Among the 586 CXRs, 438 had various abnormalities, including 46 CXRs with 66 lung nodules, and 148 CXRs had no significant abnormalities. A commercially available CAD system was applied to all 586 CXRs. True nodules and false positives (FPs) marked on CXRs by the CAD system were evaluated based on the corresponding chest CT findings.

## Results

The CAD system marked 47 of 66 (71%) lung nodules in this consecutive series of CXRs. The mean FP rate per image was 1.3 across all 586 CXRs, with 1.5 FPs per image on the 438 abnormal CXRs and 0.8 FPs per image on the 148 normal CXRs. A total of 41% of the 752 FP marks were related to non-nodule pathologic findings.

## Conclusions

A currently available CAD system marked 71% of radiologist-identified lung nodules in a large consecutive series of CXRs, and 41% of “false” marks were caused by pathologic findings.

Potentially resectable lung cancers missed by radiologists on conventional chest radiographs (CXRs) in clinical practice are mostly located in the lung periphery and have a median diameter of about 20 mm . Even under the constrained conditions of an observer performance study, where observers are specifically focused on nodule detection, about 40% of all subtle cancers remain undetected by radiologists . However, advances in radiographic chest imaging such as dual–energy subtraction (DES), temporal subtraction, and computer-aided detection (CAD) have the potential to improve radiologists' performance in the detection of subtle, obscured, or otherwise potentially overlooked lung cancers .

Previous reports of a Food and Drug Administration–approved chest CAD system (OnGuard, Riverain Medical) applied to the detection of radiologist-missed lung cancers on CXRs described relatively low sensitivity and a high number of false-positive (FP) detections (35% sensitivity with 5.9 FPs per radiograph with OnGuard 1.0 and 50% sensitivity with 3.9 FPs per radiograph with OnGuard 3.0 ). Over the past few years, however, newer versions of the same nodule detection system have achieved higher lung nodule detection sensitivities with markedly improved specificity compared to these earlier versions . This CAD system recently incorporated bone suppression imaging (BSI) , which, in addition to impacting CAD system performance, can improve radiologists' accuracy in the detection of lung nodules and discrimination between true-positive and FP CAD marks on CXRs through direct visualization of the BSI images.
