## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to demonstrate the viability of microcomputed tomographic colonography (μCTC) as a tool for monitoring tumorigenesis in mouse models of human colorectal cancer during prospective longitudinal studies. The precision and accuracy of volumetric measurements were determined to assess whether changes in tumor volume over time were readily detectable.

## Materials and Methods

All animal studies were conducted under the guidelines set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the American Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. μCTC was performed on C57BL/6J (B6) mice carrying the _Min_ allele of _Apc_ , ultimately yielding 18 scans. Assessments of scan quality and tumor volume were both performed once per week over 8 weeks.

## Results

Scans with a good quality rating had a mean standard deviation in tumor volume measurement of 8%. By contrast, scans with a poor quality rating had a mean standard deviation in tumor volume measurement of 35%. Variables affecting μCTC scan quality in living mice included bowel preparation, motion artifact, and tumor morphology. Tumor volume measurements were highly correlated with tumor weight ( _r  2_ = 0.87).

## Conclusions

The reproducibility of tumor volume measurement at μCTC in living mice makes prospective longitudinal evaluation of colonic tumor response feasible. For μCTC scans of good quality, a 16% change in tumor volume can be detected at the 95% confidence level.

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The American Cancer Society projects 153,760 new cases of colon and rectal cancer for 2007 ( ). Importantly, colorectal cancer is largely preventable if detected early. The 5-year survival rate for a stage I diagnosis is 90% ( ). Unfortunately, only 39% of cases are detected at this stage, owing to low rates of screening and patient compliance ( ). Although optical colonoscopy is the current gold standard for the detection of colorectal neoplasia, computed tomographic colonography (CTC) is rapidly emerging as a viable less invasive alternative. CTC touts the noteworthy advantage of not requiring sedation or pain control. In addition, one study has reported sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy ( ).

Pickhardt et al described the ability to reliably detect colonic tumors in living mice using microcomputed tomographic colonography (μCTC) ( ). They found that μCTC has good sensitivity (93.3%) and specificity (98.5%) for in vivo detection of polyps with a maximum diameter greater than 2 mm. This experimental platform permits prospective longitudinal evaluation of tumorigenesis in the mammalian colon and has two major advantages over a cross-sectional study design. First, individual tumors can be monitored serially, eliminating animal-to-animal variation and ultimately reducing the number of mice needed to achieve high statistical power ( ). Second, specific tumors can be identified as either responders or nonresponders and then studied ex vivo to assess differences at the molecular level.

Table 1


Criteria for Scan Quality Rating of Microcomputed Tomographic Colonography Studies


Rating Criteria Good Meets at least three of the four criteria: good colon distension, no motion artifact, typical polypoid tumor shape, and well-defined tumor margins. Fair Meets two of the four criteria. Poor Meets only one of the four criteria, or else reproducible segmentation is deemed not possible.

![Figure 1, Scan quality is variable. Image A was consistently rated as good because of good colonic distension, low motion artifact, typical shape, and well-defined tumor margins. Image B was consistently rated poor because of motion artifact, ill-defined tumor margins, and proximity of a fecal pellet (arrowhead) to the tumor (arrow). Approximately 78% of microCT colonoscopies currently done in our lab are good.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ReproducibilityofTumorVolumeMeasurementatMicroCTColonographyinLivingMice/0_1s20S1076633207005703.jpg)

![Figure 2, The segmentation process is rigorously designed to minimize reader subjectivity. One or several slices in each orthogonal plane are selected to use as the skeleton for our segmentation volume (a, b) . Next a wrap filter is applied (c, d) using an algorithm based on scattered data interpolation with radial basis functions. The volume is trimmed using a gradient image (e, f) . Finally, a morphologic three-dimensional dilation filter is applied (g, h) . Images in the bottom row are three-dimensional renderings of two-dimensional segmentations in the top row.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ReproducibilityofTumorVolumeMeasurementatMicroCTColonographyinLivingMice/1_1s20S1076633207005703.jpg)

where the sum is from _i_ = 1 to _n_ voxels. The correlation coefficient was an indication of the relative number of voxels in common between two segmented volumes (ie, how well the two volumes match up). A correlation coefficient of 0 indicated no overlap between two volumes in space and a coefficient of 1 indicated perfect alignment with respect to morphology and position.

![Figure 3, The importance of measuring three-dimensional correlation is illustrated by two segmentation attempts shown in blue and red. (a, b) Two segmentation attempts of a tumor in a good scan. The reader made similar decisions regarding tumor boundary and the three-dimensional rendering shows a significant amount of volume in common (c) . The volumes were 49.3 mm 3 (a) and 49.9 mm 3 (b) and the correlation in three-dimensional space was 95.4%. (e, f) Two segmentation attempts of a tumor in a poor scan. The reader had difficulty with precise segmentation and the result was less volume in common (f) . The volumes measured for these scans were coincidently both 3.5 mm 3 but the correlation in three-dimensional space was only 73.5%. This example demonstrates why volume measurements alone are not sufficient to evaluate precision.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ReproducibilityofTumorVolumeMeasurementatMicroCTColonographyinLivingMice/2_1s20S1076633207005703.jpg)
