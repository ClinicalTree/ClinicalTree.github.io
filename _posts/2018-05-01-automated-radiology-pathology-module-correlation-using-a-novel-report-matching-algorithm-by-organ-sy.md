## Objectives and Rationale

Radiology-pathology correlation is time-consuming and is not feasible in most clinical settings, with the notable exception of breast imaging. The purpose of this study was to determine if an automated radiology-pathology report pairing system could accurately match radiology and pathology reports, thus creating a feedback loop allowing for more frequent and timely radiology-pathology correlation.

## Methods

An experienced radiologist created a matching matrix of radiology and pathology reports. These matching rules were then exported to a novel comprehensive radiology-pathology module. All distinct radiology-pathology pairings at our institution from January 1, 2016 to July 1, 2016 were included ( _n_ = 8999). The appropriateness of each radiology-pathology report pairing was scored as either “correlative” or “non-correlative.” Pathology reports relating to anatomy imaged in the specific imaging study were deemed correlative, whereas pathology reports describing anatomy not imaged with the particular study were denoted non-correlative.

## Results

Overall, there was 88.3% correlation (accuracy) of the radiology and pathology reports ( _n_ = 8999). Subset analysis demonstrated that computed tomography (CT) abdomen/pelvis, CT head/neck/face, CT chest, musculoskeletal CT (excluding spine), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abdomen/pelvis, MRI brain, musculoskeletal MRI (excluding spine), breast MRI, positron emission tomography (PET), breast ultrasound, and head/neck ultrasound all demonstrated greater than 91% correlation. When further stratified by imaging modality, CT, MRI, mammography, and PET demonstrated excellent correlation (greater than 96.3%). Ultrasound and non-PET nuclear medicine studies demonstrated poorer correlation (80%).

## Conclusion

There is excellent correlation of radiology imaging reports and appropriate pathology reports when matched by organ system. Rapid, appropriate radiology-pathology report pairings provide an excellent opportunity to close feedback loop to the interpreting radiologist.

## Introduction

Radiology-pathology correlation is an essential component of learning radiology . Accurate and timely feedback, such as that provided by radiology-pathology correlation, is a crucial element in developing expertise and accuracy in diagnosis . However, aside from breast imaging, rigorous radiology-pathology correlation is haphazardly performed, with the majority of the correlation requiring the radiologist to actively seek pathologic results via the medical record or discussion with clinicians . Unfortunately, this process results in inadequate radiology-pathology correlation, missed opportunities for valuable feedback to radiologists, and may also cause the propagation of inaccurate information.

We created an automated radiology-pathology module to convey radiology and pathology reports to the interpreting radiologist and trainee, allowing the radiologists to receive appropriate feedback for all pathology results available following the interpretation of imaging studies. The module alerts the reporting radiologist to matching pathologic pairings via both a computerized radiology-pathology module integrated with Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) and via a secured e-mail. The radiologist then has the opportunity to review the imaging study through the radiology-pathology module in our PACS while simultaneously making a decision about concordance of the radiology interpretation with the pathologic diagnosis. Prior studies have acknowledged the value of radiology-pathology correlations by testing modules that use natural language processing, with one study reporting moderate accuracy (71%) in pairing appropriate reports . However, despite the potential benefits of these systems, they have not yet been routinely utilized by the radiology community as high accuracy in matching reports is necessary to allow for seamless integration into a radiologist's daily workflow.
