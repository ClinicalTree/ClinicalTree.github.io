## Rationale and Objectives

RadLex was developed to create a unified language for radiologists. Despite the large number of terms, little research has evaluated the degree to which RadLex contains terms frequently used in clinical practice. The purposes of this project are to estimate the completeness of RadLex in the chest radiography domain and to characterize the absent terms. We chose chest radiography because it is a common exam generating a large number of reports, and the terms used represent a relatively well-circumscribed set of terms compared to other anatomic regions and modalities.

## Materials and Methods

We collected a random sample of 100 chest radiograph reports from 1 month of routine clinical practice of three board-certified radiologists. We parsed each report's findings and impression sections into individual objects. An “object” was defined as any discrete physical object, body part, observation, descriptive modifier, diagnosis, or procedure. Objects were compared to RadLex by entering the object into the RadLex Term Browser. We calculated descriptive statistics and compared the match rate across RadLex categories.

## Results

We identified 339 unique objects, with an overall match rate of 62%. The match rate for each category was anatomic object, 77%; physiological condition, 73%; physical object, 65%; imaging observation, 47%; procedure, 0%; other, 41% ( _P_ < .0005).

## Conclusions

Our study shows that despite the large number of terms in RadLex, terms are still absent and complexities in the definitions of terms exist. However, increasing the completeness and refining the definitions in RadLex is easily surmountable, possibly using manual methods.

An ontology is a way of representing the terms and relationships in a domain. Ontologies are useful representations of domains because they are can be browsed by humans and processed by machines . RadLex , a radiology-specific ontology, was developed in 2006 to create a unified language for radiologists. A radiology-specific lexicon was needed to make more efficient use of the growing amount of electronic information in the radiology environment , in particular in the creation of electronic teaching materials, and to more accurately search reports and perform data-mining tasks. The RadLex terms were originally gathered from existent sources including the American College of Radiology (ACR) Index, SNOMED-CT, and the Foundational Model Anatomy, and now includes more than 30,000 terms . More recently, a large number of unique imaging signs were added to the RadLex ontology .

Despite the large number of terms within the RadLex ontology, little research has evaluated the degree to which RadLex contains terms frequently used in clinical practice. The single study that specifically evaluated which terms contained in clinical free text reports are in RadLex evaluated an early version of RadLex (January 2007). This study found that 84% of thoracic computed tomography (CT) terms used at a single institution and derived from an automated term identification algorithm were included in RadLex and that anatomic terms and imaging findings were the most robust sections within RadLex. Since that time, newer versions of RadLex have been released, and continuous updates to the ontology are performed. More recent research analyzed the number of terms that match reporting templates developed by the Radiological Society of North America reporting initiative and found a 41% exact match rate for terms in RadLex.
