Cambridge University Press’s _Clinical MR Neuroimaging: Physiological and Functional Techniques_ , Second Edition, impressed me in many ways. As a sign of how interesting I found this book, I cannot recall the last time I marked so many pages in a book! I found the book extremely well organized, timely, relevant, well written, and very well designed. Given the size of this book, it is probably more likely to hold a place of distinction in a personal or reading room library rather than be carried around in a backpack, at least in my opinion. I was particularly struck by how fluid it was to move through the book, given what appeared to me to be its textbook size. The individual sections appear relatively short, well designed, well illustrated and are interspersed with cases presented in a very succinct format. Overall, I adored the cases and found them to be very, very high yield. Using color enhancements in the illustrations (rather than grayscale only) seemed a very nice touch as well. This book seems to me to be most optimally suited for those who interpret advanced neuroimaging and would like to know more about these growing fields. I do not feel comfortable making a comparison to the first edition of this book.
