## Rationale and Objectives

To characterize an iodized oil emulsion for computed tomography (CT) imaging of experimental hepatic tumors in rat models.

## Materials and Methods

For characterizing the agents in normal rats, three rats were intravenously infused and imaged with clinical CT up to 1 week. Iopamidol solution was also used as controls ( _n_ = 3). For evaluating the feasibility of diagnosis of hepatic tumors, 12 rats were injected with C6 glial tumor cells into the liver 11, 9, 7, and 5 days before CT ( _n_ = 3 per day). After CT imaging, gross and histopathologic correlation of liver tumors with CT images were performed.

## Results

CT numbers of aorta and inferior vena cava (IVC) increased immediately after injection of the emulsion and remained above 200 Hounsfield units for 1 hour (maximum: 295.67 ± 27.65 in aorta and 347.07 ± 10.58 in IVC). The mean attenuation in liver and spleen was relatively stable between 30 and 180 minutes (maximum: 188.84 ± 18.70 in liver and 210.97 ± 15.83 in spleen). All 20 tumors later confirmed by pathology were detected as hypodense lesions on CT (sensitivity: 100%; range, 2.0–16.4 mm). The mean enhancement ratios of liver at all time points were significantly higher than those of tumors ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

The hepatic enhancement achieved by the iodized oil emulsion is reticuloendothelial system–specific with the property of blood pool enhancement and longer lasting than that achievable with the current water soluble agents. Thus, this agent may offer significant advantages for diagnosis of hepatic metastases.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging enhanced with water-soluble iodinated contrast is an important diagnostic modality in the preoperative evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic metastases. The choice between surgical or palliative treatment depends on the size, number, and location of metastases as determined by imaging . However, the limitations of these contrast agents include their extravasation and accumulation in both normal hepatic parenchyma and metastatic tumors, precluding accurate diagnosis of small hepatic metastases . The lack of accurate and early detection of metastatic lesions in many cases remains the major obstacle to effective patient treatment and ultimately to survival.

In comparison to water soluble agents, contrast agents consisting of particles selectively enhance the liver and spleen because the particles are sequestered by the phagocytic reticuloendothelial system (RES) . Therefore, they may provide enhanced diagnostic accuracy for hepatic metastatic lesions, because all metastatic liver lesions do not contain Kupffer cells constituting the RES. For CT imaging, several particulate contrast agents, including perfluorooctylbromide , ethiodol oil emulsion-13 , and liposomal agents , have been investigated.
