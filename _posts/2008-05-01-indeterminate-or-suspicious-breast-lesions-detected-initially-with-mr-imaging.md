## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively determine the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-directed breast ultrasonography (US) in the evaluation of indeterminate or suspicious lesions identified on contrast-enhanced, breast MRI.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 395 patients presenting for breast MRI during a 4-year period was retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-one patients were recommended for MRI-directed US for further characterization of indeterminate or suspicious breast lesions detected on MRI. Fifty-five patients (all female; age 31–80 years) had US. Their MRI and US were reviewed and tested for correlations with histologic results or long term follow-up. Logistic regression analyses were used to test for associations between MRI lesion characteristics and US detection rate.

## Results

US identified 46 of 97 (47%) lesions depicted at MRI from 55 patients (47 \[85%\] of these patients had histories of breast malignancies). Twelve cancers were found from the 97 lesions (12%). Biopsy was avoidable in 10 lesions (10%). The detection rate with US was slightly higher with “mass” (55% \[23/42\]) lesions described in MRI than “non–mass” lesions or lymph nodes (42% \[23/55\]). There was a significant positive association (odd ratio = 1.23: 95% CI = 1.05–1.43, _P_ = .01) between US detection rate and MRI mass lesion size. There was no statistical significance between US detection rate and the presence of malignancies; 42% (5/12) of MRI malignant lesions were not visualized with US.

## Conclusions

MRI-directed US reduced the number of biopsies required for indeterminate or suspicious MRI lesions. Nevertheless, the lesions which were biopsied had a low rate of malignancy.

Although the use of contrast-enhanced, breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the general population has increased exponentially in the past decade ( ), some inherent diagnostic limitations of MRI remain unsolved. The sensitivity of MRI for the detection of breast cancer is high ( ), but its specificity is only moderate, ranging from 37% to 100% ( ). To reduce false-positive rates, the findings of MRI are often tested for correlations with findings from other breast imaging modalities.

When abnormalities detected by MRI are occult on mammograms or are not identified with breast ultrasonography (US) performed before the MRI, a second-look or MRI-directed US is commonly prescribed for further characterization of the MRI findings ( ). The reported sensitivity of MRI-directed US ranged from 23% to 89% ( ). US has many advantages, including wide availability, low cost, and portability. In addition, US may provide guidance for a biopsy when a detected lesion is deemed malignant or suspicious ( ). This option is particularly important in breast imaging centers that are not equipped with the necessary facilities to perform MRI-guided breast biopsies.
