This text was written by nine radiologists, most of whom are based at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. _EXPERTddx: Pediatrics_ is part of the _EXPERTddx_ series of books, which are differential diagnosis–based radiology references. The intended reader of this text is likely any radiologist who desires a more expansive knowledge of pediatric radiology. Although the information about the diagnoses presented is far from exhaustive, the concise description of each of the diagnoses makes this book ideal for board examination preparation. This book may not fulfill the needs of practicing pediatric radiologists, but I do think this book will be particularly useful for those in a training setting, including residents and pediatric radiology fellows. General radiologists in practice who find themselves somewhat uncomfortable with pediatric imaging may also find this text valuable.

This book, like the others in the series, presents lists of differential diagnoses for various imaging findings and clinical presentations. The text is well organized into seven sections covering cardiac, chest, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, brain, head, and neck, and spine imaging. The sections are conveniently color coded for quick reference. The diagnoses are divided into common, less common, and rare but important disease processes. In a concise, bulleted format, the key facts regarding the etiologies, clinical features, and imaging characteristics of these diagnoses are also presented.

Numerous clear, well-annotated images are presented for each of the diagnoses discussed. In sum, this book includes 2000 images, with numerous examples of many of the included diagnoses. An online electronic companion book is also included, which provides additional images and a searchable format. The number and quality of the images included are a real strength of this book.

The wide-ranging list of differential diagnoses this book presents in a well-organized format will make it very useful for general radiologists who desire additional pediatric imaging knowledge or for radiologists in training. The numerous images included will serve to underscore the information presented in the text while keeping the reader's interest.
