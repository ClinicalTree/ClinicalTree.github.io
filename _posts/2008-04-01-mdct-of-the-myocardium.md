## Rationale and Objectives

Despite the progress made in diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular diseases remain the main cause of death worldwide.

## Materials and Methods

Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) provides several diagnostic insights, namely assessment of coronary artery anatomy and measurement of left ventricular volume and function. The ability of CT to show myocardial infarcted areas as an enhanced territory was described in the late 1970s in an animal model.

## Results

This method found a second wind with the arrival of MDCT technology that led to its clinical application. Several authors describe the ability of MDCT to assess myocardial injury both in animals and humans. The MDCT assessment of myocardial late enhancement is based on the same principle as delayed enhancement MRI.

## Conclusions

The aim of this review is to cover the technical aspects of cardiac MDCT in assessing the myocardium and its potential in diagnosing ischemic heart disease.

Traditionally electrocardiography, nuclear imaging, stress echocardiography, and, more recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been the clinical mainstays for assessing ischemic heart disease. However, modern multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) is an emerging noninvasive imaging technology that provides high-resolution three-dimensional images of the heart and coronary artery. MDCT provides several diagnostic insights that can be obtained separately or in various combinations during a patient examination. For example, MDCT can be used to assess the anatomy of the coronary arteries and cardiac chambers ( ), left ventricular volumes and function ( ), myocardial tissue injury ( ), and myocardial perfusion ( ).

A current state of the art MDCT scanner acquires 64 channels of data with a detector width of 0.5 or 0.6 mm. The fastest rotation time is 330 milliseconds, which results in a temporal resolution of 165 milliseconds with a 180° reconstruction algorithm ( ). The scan time has decreased from 40 seconds for the first MDCT generation to less than 10 seconds with the 64-slice technologies. Recently, dual-source CT was introduced, with an improvement in temporal resolution (83 milliseconds) ( ). Scanners with more detectors that cover the entire heart are now being developed, which may abolish the need for a moving table. Cardiac MRI remains the gold standard technique for viability assessment and infarct characterization and will be used as such in this article. The aim of this review is to cover the technical aspects of cardiac MDCT in assessing the myocardium and its potential in diagnosing ischemic heart disease.

![Figure 1, A 60-year-old man was explored 1 week after an acute coronary syndrome using MDCT with an arterial rule-out phase (a,d,e,f) and a tissue rule-out phase (b,c) 10 minutes after contrast injection. A multiplanar reformation reconstruction was obtained to assess the pattern of enhancement in the myocardium (a) and showed a hypoperfused area (black arrowhead). Curved MPR reconstruction was used to assess coronary anatomy (d,e) and showed a significant residual stenosis (white arrow) at the proximal edge of the stent and the distal circumflex ostium. Volume rendering reconstruction (f) showed the stent in the first marginal branch and the distal circumflex artery. On late enhanced images (b,c) , hyperenhanced myocardium is seen in the lateral left ventricular wall with a no-reflow lesion in the core of the infarct area.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MDCToftheMyocardium/0_1s20S107663320700671X.jpg)
