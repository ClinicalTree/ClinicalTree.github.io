## Rationale and Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the uncertainty in computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) radiology reports, manifested by descriptions of report limitations and image quality.

## Materials and methods

CTPA reports between 2004 and 2006 were reviewed for patient demographic data (age, gender, pregnancy state), radiologist data (years of experience, subspecialty, final dictation by an attending radiologist vs a resident being present and dictating the report), the presence of pulmonary embolism (PE), and key words describing examination quality and limitations.

## Results

There were 2151 CTPA reports. Patterns of reporting CTPA in the impression sections of radiology reports were as follows: (1) PE conclusively positive (10%), (2) PE conclusively negative (29%), (3) PE negative to segmental arteries (27%), (4) PE negative to central pulmonary arteries (21%), (5) PE negative but suboptimal examination (8%), and (6) nondiagnostic examination (5%). Among the last three categories, seven PEs were not initially diagnosed but were found on subsequent imaging examinations. Limitations in image quality, respiratory motion artifact, and contrast enhancement were most frequently mentioned as limitations in image quality (62% and 28% of all reports, respectively). Radiologists tended to report limitations in image quality if they were thoracic radiology subspecialists, had >10 years of experience, or worked independently ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Different patterns of reporting CTPA exist and vary on the basis of individual radiologists' subspecialties, experience, and whether they work independently or with residents. Certain wording regarding the presence of PE may falsely imply negativity of PE in a limited examination.

The radiology report is the final document that describes the findings of a radiologic consultation by a radiologist and is forwarded to the referring physician. Most of the images are not viewed by the referring physician, and as a result, the referring physician depends highly on the radiology report for diagnosing the patient's condition. The American College of Radiology has provided guidelines for the communication of diagnostic imaging findings, with a detailed section describing what constitutes an official radiology report , but adherence to the guidelines by the radiology community is not known. With availability of picture archiving and communication system and teleradiology, radiologists have decreased contact with referring physicians. Thus, the importance of the radiology report is even more significant.

In a large institution where there are many radiologists, the variation in reports of the same type of examination can be wide, from the number of words the authors use to describe the same findings, to differences in vocabulary, to the manner in which the reports are structured . These variations can contribute to a lack of uniformity and quality. The variation across different radiologists can also be a source of frustration for referring physicians. Cohesive, clear reports with less variation in style and content can help referring physicians improve the quality of care they provide to their patients. Therefore, a meaningful radiology report needs to be concise, unambiguous, and clearly answer the clinical questions.
