## Rationale and Objectives

Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in women worldwide. Lymphatic mapping with sentinel node biopsy has the potential to reduce the morbidity associated with breast cancer staging in women after neoadjuvant therapy.

## Materials and Methods

A systematic search of world literature between 1996 and 2007 of sentinel node mapping in patients with early-stage breast carcinoma after chemotherapy was undertaken. Potentially eligible studies were identified using database-specific search strategies incorporating appropriate Boolean combinations of the keywords sentinel node biopsy or sentinel node localization or lymphatic mapping; breast cancer or malignancy or neoplasm; and preoperative or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The electronic searches were augmented with a manual search of reference lists from identified articles. Successful lymph node mapping, defined as successful identification rate (SIR), and false-negative rate (FNR) was summarized using a bivariate random effects mixed model. The extent of heterogeneity was assessed using the inconsistency statistic. The effect of study level covariates, such as use of immunohistochemistry or dual mapping technique, and individual quality criteria, such as study design or multi-institution participation, on SIR and FNR were analyzed using metaregression.

## Results

A total of 24 trials of 1799 subjects were reported that met eligibility criteria. All studies identified were published between 2000 and 2007. Lymph node involvement was found in 758 patients (37%) and ranged from 25% to 96% across studies. The proportion of patients who had successful lymph node mapping ranged from 63% to 100%, with 79% of studies reporting a rate of less than 95%. The summary successful identification rate was 0.896 (95% confidence interval \[CI\] 0.860–0.923) with moderate heterogeneity. The summary FNR was 0.084 (95% CI 0.064–0.109) with no significant heterogeneity. Increasing prevalence of lymph node involvement and same-day mapping and lymph node dissection both significantly reduced the FNR.

## Conclusions

The present systematic review demonstrates robust estimates of successful identification rate and false-negative rates of sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy after neoadjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer patients. With a 90% SIR and 8% FNR, this technique is a reliable tool for planning treatment in this population as an alternative to completion axillary lymph node dissection.

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization . Most patients are currently diagnosed with localized non-metastatic breast cancer (Stages 0–1) on mammography . The most important determinant of prognosis for breast cancer patients are tumor size and the status of the axillary lymph nodes . The presence of regional metastases in the axillary basin reduces a patients' 5-year survival by approximately 28% to 40% . Staging of the axilla was formerly performed at surgery with a level I and II axillary lymph node dissection. Axillary lymph node dissection has significant side effects of lymphedema and arm swelling . Since the early 1990s, sentinel lymph node mapping and subsequent biopsy has shown much promise in the axillary staging and surgical management of breast cancer . The sentinel node biopsy is based on the sentinel node hypothesis proposed by Cabanas . The aim of the technique is to demonstrate which patients have axillary metastasis and resulting direct subsequent lymph node dissection. Many studies have demonstrated the accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping in the staging of early breast cancer . Reported identification rates and false-negative rates (FNR) in patients who have not received chemotherapy range from 84% to 100% and 0% to 13%, respectively . Sentinel lymph node mapping is rapidly replacing axillary lymph node dissection in the primary staging of breast cancer .

Preoperative (or neoadjuvant) chemotherapy has become the standard of care in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIIB) and is being used increasingly in patients with localized non-metastatic disease (Stages 0–1) . Although it has not improved the survival rate compared to adjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can decrease the magnitude of the operative procedure required, converting many patients from mastectomy to breast conservation surgery . The use of sentinel lymph node mapping in patients after preoperative chemotherapy has been proposed, but its role is less certain. Studies in the literature report identification rates of 76.3% to 100% and accuracies of 79% to 98% . The question of whether sentinel node biopsy is feasible and accurate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one of great importance because neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to downstage axillary lymph nodes in a significant proportion of patients .
