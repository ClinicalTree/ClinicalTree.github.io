## Rationale and Objectives

Quantitative measurement of renal perfusion in murine models provides important information on the organ physiology and disease states. The 1-T desktop magnetic resonance imaging has a small footprint and a self-contained fringe field. This resultant flexibility in siting makes the system ideal for preclinical imaging research. Our objective was to evaluate the capability of the 1-T desktop magnetic resonance imaging to measure mouse renal perfusion without the administration of exogenous contrast agents.

## Materials and Methods

We implemented a flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR)-based arterial spin labeling sequence with a mouse volume coil on a 1-T desktop magnetic resonance scanner. The validity of the implementation was tested by comparing obtained renal perfusion results with literature values for normal mice and challenging the technique with mice treated with furosemide, a blood vessel vasoconstrictor drug.

## Results

The measured cortical and medullary perfusions were quantified to be 402 ± 95 and 184 ± 52 mL/100 g/min, respectively, in agreement with literature values. The ratio of cortical to medullary renal blood flow was between 2 and 3 and was independent of the mouse weight. As expected, upon furosemide injection, a decrease (~50%) in cortical perfusion was observed in the mice population, at 1 hour post injection compared to baseline ( _P_ < 0.0001), which returned to baseline after 24 hours ( _P_ = 0.68).

## Conclusions

We reported the successful application of FAIR-based arterial spin labeling for noncontrast perfusion measurement of mouse kidneys using a 1-T desktop scanner. The easy implementation of FAIR sequence on a 1-T desktop scanner offers the potential for longitudinal perfusion studies in limited access areas such as behind the barrier in mouse facilities and in multimodality preclinical imaging laboratories without the administration of exogenous contrast agents.

## Introduction

The quantitative measurement of renal perfusion in murine models is important in preclinical research to assess both renal function and the effects of antiangiogenic therapies in models of renal cancer. Perfusion measurement gives information regarding organ performance, disease state, and understanding of inter- and intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity . Tumor blood flow has also been suggested as a predictive parameter in assessing the effects of the treatment of tumors with antiangiogenic therapy . Imaging techniques that are based on radioactive tracers like positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography have been used to assess perfusion. However, applications of these techniques, particularly for longitudinal monitoring of disease progression or treatment to response, are limited due to radiation exposure and invasiveness. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique using dynamic contrast enhancement provides high–spatial resolution perfusion study but requires the injection of a gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent. Reports of a link between the administration of Gd-based contrast agents and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis , along with recent studies on Gd deposition in the brain , do not make contrast-enhanced MRI ideal for perfusion imaging. Noninvasive perfusion MRI techniques will therefore logically gain importance in multiparametric MRI methods in cancer research.

Arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI is a noninvasive technique that has been used to measure noncontrast perfusion . ASL uses radiofrequency pulses and magnetic field gradients to label the inflowing spins of blood water molecules and measures their accumulation in the tissue of interest. ASL MRI can be broadly classified into two categories: pulsed ASL and continuous ASL. Continuous ASL can provide a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but requires external hardware that can be challenging to implement on standard scanners. Recent developments such as pseudocontinuous ASL can be performed on standard scanners without the need for additional hardware , but this technique requires a specific location to label the inflowing blood, which can be difficult to achieve in small animal imaging . Alternatively, the pulsed ASL technique using flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) globally inverts all the blood spins outside the imaging slab, avoiding the challenges with labeling location, and is easy to implement on standard scanners for small animal imaging .
