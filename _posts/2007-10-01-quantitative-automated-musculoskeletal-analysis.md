Musculoskeletal diseases have a great impact on the quality of life for the individual. Diseases such as osteoporosis (OP), osteoarthritis (OA), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) often cause pain, stiffness, and loss of mobility, thereby preventing an active life style as well as reducing the work ability. The high prevalence of these diseases combined with the reduced work ability implies a large socioeconomic impact. It is estimated that the total economic burden of arthritis is between 1% and 2.5% of the gross national product of Western countries ( ).

There are many factors related to the onset of these degenerative joint diseases such as trauma, level of exercise, weight, and genetics. However, in general, they are age-related and slowly progressing. Common for these diseases is also that—although there may be preventive treatments with some effect (such as hormone replacement treatment for OP) ( )—there are no effective treatments beyond symptom control. This is in spite of extensive research into both disease etiology and intervention strategies. Important limiting factor for the development of new, effective treatments are the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the methods used to monitor the disease progression during clinical studies. Both during development and during validation trials, it is necessary to be able to quantify the effect of a potential treatment. For this, precise biomarkers that accurately quantify central aspects of the state of the disease are needed.

Development of biomarkers for musculoskeletal diseases is challenging due to the relatively slow progression of the disease and because of the mixture of several systemic and biomechanical processes that introduces great variation in the progression of the diseases. A number of relatively old, semiquantitative, golden standard biomarkers exist such as the Kellgren and Lawrence score ( ) for OA based mainly on osteophytes and joint space narrowing or the vertebral fracture risk scoring based on vertebrae height measurements ( ).

These traditional scoring systems are based on expert, medical experience and provide very sensible quantification methods. However, they also suffer from a lack of sensitivity caused by the use of few manual measurements combined with the semiquantitative scores. Since the development of these scores, there have been great advances in both imaging technology and in image analysis methodology. Thereby, it is now possibly to include more anatomical structures true to the actual anatomy, such as the ability to visualize cartilage directly in three dimensions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared with the indirect joint space width measurements from two-dimensional radiographs. And through automated computer-based analysis it is possible to design more comprehensive scoring systems that are not limited by the time that the medical expert can spend on the individual patient.

In recent years, new computer-based methods for quantitative automated musculoskeletal analysis are surfacing. Some with focus on advances in imaging technology, such as cartilage visualization from very-high-field 7T MRI ( ) or joint kinematics from dynamic MRI ( ). Others with focus on computer-aided automation of existing biomarkers—such as hand joint space measurements ( ). And finally, methods focusing on image analysis methodology—such as automatic cartilage segmentation ( ) or automatic vertebral fracture analysis ( ). However, in spite of the recent advances, the collaboration between clinical researchers and technologically oriented researchers within medical image analysis is still relatively limited (for instance compared with the integration between clinical research and molecular biology research) ( ).

The MICCAI Joint Disease Workshop (see workshop logo in  Fig 1 ) was organized with the desire to further exchange of expertise, ideas, and results between the clinically oriented and the technically oriented researchers. The single-day workshop was gifted with many very interesting submissions and with lively discussions during the presentation from the invited speaker (Felix Eckstein from the Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg), as well as during the seven oral and nine poster presentations.

The workshop logo was composed from a sketch inspired by the little mermaid made for MICCAI 2006. The original little mermaid is a sculpture from 1913 by Edvard Eriksen. Surely, sitting on a rock in the relatively cold Copenhagen harbor water, this aging lady must be familiar with joint stiffness in the morning.
