## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to describe the imaging appearance of patients undergoing active surveillance for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively identified 29 patients undergoing active surveillance for DCIS from 2009 to 2014. Twenty-two patients (group 1) refused surgery or were not surgical candidates. Seven patients (group 2) enrolled in a trial of letrozole and deferred surgical excision for 6–12 months. Pathology and imaging results at the initial biopsy and follow-up were recorded.

## Results

In group 1, the median follow-up was 2.7 years (range: 0.6–13.9 years). Fifteen patients (68%) remained stable. Seven patients (32%) underwent additional biopsies with invasive ductal carcinoma diagnosed in two patients after 3.9 and 3.6 years who developed increasing calcifications and new masses. In group 2, one patient (14%) was upstaged to microinvasive ductal carcinoma at surgery. Among the patients in both groups with calcifications ( _n_ = 26), there was no progression to invasive disease among those with stable (50%, 13/26) or decreased (19%, 5/26) calcifications.

## Conclusions

Among a DCIS active surveillance cohort, invasive disease progression presented as increasing calcifications and a new mass following more than 3.5 years of stable imaging. In contrast, there was no progression to invasive disease among cases of DCIS with stable or decreasing calcifications. Close imaging is a key follow-up component in active surveillance.

## Introduction

Since the widespread adoption of screening mammography, the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has steadily increased, now representing 20%–30% of all new breast cancer diagnoses . Although DCIS is very common, the natural history of the disease is not well known because complete surgical excision is currently the standard of care . However, there is strong circumstantial evidence that 50%–85% of DCIS cases will never progress to invasive disease , and if DCIS does progress, it is unlikely to shift to a higher nuclear grade . This finding has prompted growing concerns regarding DCIS overdiagnosis and overtreatment with a desire for alternative management strategies .

Active surveillance is a management strategy for low-risk DCIS, which avoids surgical excision, may utilize hormonal therapy to suppress growth, and emphasizes imaging follow-up to detect whether progression to invasive disease occurs . Active surveillance is based on the premise that not all DCIS cases are life threatening and that many patients may die with the disease than from the disease, especially those with competing mortality risks . The safety and effectiveness of active surveillance have been identified as a key research need by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and the National Institutes of Health Panel on the Diagnosis and Management of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ . There is only one published manuscript of active surveillance outcomes, which demonstrated feasibility among a well-informed patient population but an increased risk of invasive cancer at surgical excision . There are three active surveillance trials in progress. The LOw Risk DCIS (LORD) trial in Europe compares annual mammography to usual care among women with low-grade DCIS with the primary outcome of ipsilateral invasive cancer . In England, the LOw RISk DCIS (LORIS) trial is comparing annual mammography to usual care among non–high grade DCIS with the primary outcome of ipsilateral invasive cancer-free survival . In the United States, the Comparison of Operative to Monitoring and Endocrine Therapy (COMET) trial is comparing endocrine therapy with biannual mammography vs usual care with ipsilateral invasive cancer diagnosis as the primary outcome .
