Regarding the international medical graduates (IMG) applying to radiology, our survey results are in line with the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) data , which show that US medical school graduates have an overall match rate almost double that of IMG applicants. At the same time, the recent literature does not offer a clear justification for such pronounced preference on the basis of clinical or academic performance. Dr. Pfeifer offers his personal experience in support of IMG radiology trainees and states that the literature quoted in our article cannot be easily extrapolated to radiology. As a spoiler alert, the recently concluded 2016 Spring Association of Program Directors in Radiology survey shows that among program directors, who have experience training IMG residents, 78% thought that IMGs performed as well as US medical doctors (MD) at the end of training. We agree with Dr. Pfeifer that more research is needed to understand the differences in performance, if any, among different trainee cohorts and the barriers to recruitment and training of IMG residents.

As to the present American Board of Radiology (ABR) examinations, in spite of the program directors' preference for oral certifying examination , the majority felt that their graduating trainees knew as much as before. We have no data to support Dr. Pfeifer's view that the oral ABR examination must be brought back.

On behalf of my coauthors, I would like to thank Dr. Pfeifer for suggesting future survey topics. His appreciation of the Committee efforts is gratefully acknowledged.
