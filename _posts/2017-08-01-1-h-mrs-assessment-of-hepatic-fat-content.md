## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to obtain a cutoff value of liver fat content for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis by comparing magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy results in children and adolescents with normal and excess weight.

## Materials and Methods

The study included 420 children and adolescents (91 normal-weight, 99 overweight, and 230 obese) 8–18 years of age. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed with a 3T MR system using point resolved spectroscopy sequence with series echo times.

## Results

The mean absolute mass concentration of liver fat was obtained: 0.5 ± 0.04% in normal-weight boys; 0.5 ± 0.03% in normal-weight girls; 0.9 ± 0.16% in boys with overweight; 1.1 ± 0.24% in girls with overweight; 1.7 ± 0.24% in boys with obesity; and 1.4 ± 0.21% in girls with obesity.

The cutoff value of absolute mass concentration of liver fat for hepatic steatosis was found to be 1.5%. Based on this cutoff value, hepatic steatosis was diagnosed in 16% of boys with overweight, 11% of girls with overweight, 32% of boys with obesity, and 27% of girls with obesity.

## Conclusions

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was successfully applied to obtain the cutoff value of absolute mass concentration of liver fat for the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis in children and adolescents. Children and adolescents with obesity have higher risk of hepatic steatosis than their peers with overweight.

## Introduction

Obesity has become a growing health challenge all over the world, beginning at early age in children and progressing into adulthood . One of the major complications caused and worsened by obesity is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis through steatohepatitis and fibrosis to end-stage liver disease (cirrhosis) and is defined as triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes exceeding 5% of the liver weight . Liver biopsy is the gold standard of diagnosis and severity assessment of NAFLD . However, it is an invasive procedure associated with serious risks .
