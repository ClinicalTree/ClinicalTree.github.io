## Highlights

- SYNTAX score commonly assesses coronary artery disease complexity by invasive coronary angiography (ICA).

- SYNTAX scores derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) are concordant with those derived from ICA.

- CCTA- and ICA-derived SYNTAX scores correlate with complexity of percutaneous coronary intervention.

- Derivation of SYNTAX score by CCTA might assist in percutaneous coronary intervention planning.

The proximal left anterior descending and distal circumflex arteries are totally occluded by predominantly non-calcified plaques. Additionally, a mixed non-calcified or calcified plaque is causing >50% stenosis in the proximal obtuse marginal artery. SYNTAX score by CCTA is 27, whereas SYNTAX score by ICA is 28.
