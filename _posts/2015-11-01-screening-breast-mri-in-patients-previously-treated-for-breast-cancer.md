## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the cancer detection rate and abnormal interpretation rate of screening breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in previously treated breast cancer patients.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board–approved retrospective review of the breast MRI database from 2009 to 2011 identified a total of 3297 screening examinations. After excluding genetic mutation carriers, untested first-degree relatives of known mutation carriers, and patients with a history of chest irradiation, there were 1194 (36.2%) examinations in 691 patients previously treated for breast cancer. MRI reports were reviewed to determine MRI findings and breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) assessments. The longitudinal medical record was reviewed to determine patient demographics and outcomes of imaging surveillance and biopsy.

## Results

Mean patient age at initial cancer diagnosis was 46.1 years, and mean patient age during the study interval was 52 years. Cancer detection rate was 10 per 1000 (1%; 95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.5%–1.8%\]; 12 of 1194 examinations). Overall 10.7% (128 of 1194) of examinations received an abnormal interpretation, including 5.4% (65 of 1194) BI-RADS 4 or 5 and 5.3% (63 of 1194) BI-RADS 3 assessments with a 9.4% positive predictive value (PPV1; 12 of 128 examinations) and a 17.9% PPV3 (12 malignancies per 67 biopsies).

## Conclusions

Screening breast MRI in women previously treated for breast cancer detected cancer in 1.0% of examinations, with a 10.7% abnormal interpretation rate, and a PPV for malignancy of 17.9%.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as a supplemental screening examination for women at an increased (at least 20%–25%) lifetime risk of developing breast cancer because of its high sensitivity for the detection of invasive malignancies. Groups recommended for supplemental MRI screening include genetic mutation carriers and first-degree untested relatives of genetic mutation carriers; women with Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes and their untested first-degree relatives; and women with a history of chest irradiation. Evidence supporting supplemental breast MRI screening has been considered to be insufficient to justify routine MRI surveillance for women with a lesser lifetime risk (15%–20%) of developing breast cancer and for women with a previous history of breast cancer .

Breast cancer survivors remain at risk for recurrent or new breast cancer, and they warrant careful clinical and mammographic follow-up. The 10-year incidence of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence after lumpectomy and radiation therapy has been reported to be 6.4% in node-negative disease and 8.7% in node-positive disease . In another study reporting 20-year follow-up results in women who had undergone prior breast conservation and radiation therapy, a 14.3% local recurrence rate was reported . Women treated with mastectomy for breast cancer have been reported to develop contralateral breast malignancies ranging from 8.9% to 12% at 20-year follow-up.

Ipsilateral lesions were considered breast cancer recurrences, and therefore, no staging is given.
