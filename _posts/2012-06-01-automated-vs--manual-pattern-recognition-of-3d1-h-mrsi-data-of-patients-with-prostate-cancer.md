## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess (1) automated analysis methods versus manual evaluation by human experts of three-dimensional proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data from patients with prostate cancer and (2) the contribution of spatial information to decision making.

## Materials and Methods

Three-dimensional proton MRSI was applied at 1.5 T. MRSI data from 10 patients with histologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, scheduled either for prostatectomy or intensity-modulated radiation therapy, were evaluated. First, two readers manually labeled spectra using spatial information to identify the localization of spectra and neighborhood information, establishing the reference set of this study. Then, spectra were labeled again manually in a blinded and randomized manner and evaluated automatically using software that applied spectral line fitting as well as pattern recognition routines. Statistical analysis of the results of the different approaches was performed.

## Results

Altogether, 1018 spectra were evaluable by all methods. Numbers of evaluable spectra differed significantly depending on patient and evaluation method. Compared to automated analysis, the readers made rather binary decisions, using information from neighboring spectra in ambiguous cases, when evaluating MRSI data as a whole. Differences between anatomically blinded and unblinded evaluation were larger than differences between evaluations using blinded data and automated techniques.

## Conclusions

An automated approach, which evaluates each spectrum individually, can be as good as an anatomy-blinded human reader. Spatial information is routinely used by human experts to support their final decisions. Automated procedures that consider anatomic information for spectral evaluation will enhance the diagnostic impact of MRSI of the human prostate.

The large-scale measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen in recent years has resulted in the detection of an immense number of prostate carcinomas . In particular, when initial biopsy results are negative, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) is applied to visualize the zonal anatomy of the prostate and localize a possible tumor . High-resolution T2-weighted (T2w) MRI performed with pelvic array coils provides good specificity (up to 90%) but low sensitivity (27%–61%) for tumor detection and localization . The use of an endorectal coil for signal reception raises the sensitivity for tumors >1 cm. However, the reported sensitivity in the literature ranges from 27% to 100%, and 32% to 99% for specificity, depending on the size of the examined tumors . Moreover, false-positive results of T2w MRI remain a problem. They are often caused by local signal reduction due to postbiopsy hemorrhage, prostatitis, or previous treatment .

These limitations fostered the inclusion of functional imaging techniques such as diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and proton MR spectroscopic imaging (  1 H MRSI) in diagnostic imaging protocols. Using MRSI, prostate cancer is characterized by increases in cholines (ie, free choline and choline-containing compounds; Cho) and a decrease in citrate levels . Single-center studies have shown that with MRSI supplementing T2w MRI, prostate cancer can be better differentiated from normal glandular tissue than with conventional MRI alone . Recently published results have demonstrated that most tumors in the prostate were missed because of their small sizes . Thus, MRSI with higher spatial resolution is needed. However, the number of obtained spectra will increase. The large set of spectra resulting from a single examination and the demand for extensive postprocessing and expertise required to interpret the data have hampered the broader application of MRSI.

Comparison of class predictions by two “blinded” readers evaluating the spectra in a single-voxel fashion shows high agreement. Few evaluations differed by more than one class, and overall variation was less than the differences between algorithms of the fitting metabolite signal templates.

Values in parentheses are the standard deviations from bootstrapping. The first line, for example, shows that the expert anatomic method had the highest correlations with _pr_ and _f1_ , both with τ = 0.73. Here, a τ value 1 indicates perfect correlation and a τ value of 0 complete randomness between two methods. Data are visualized in  Figure 6  .


![Figure 4, Visualization of data shown in Tables 1 and 3 . Multidimensional scaling (MDS) 1 yields the differences between the “single-voxel” methods, whereas MDS 2 shows the differences between anatomic and single-voxel methods. The distances encode the similarity or dissimilarity of the different methods. Scaling of both axes is arbitrary. Although the results of fitting metabolite signal templates ( f1 and f2 ) are at nearly identical positions, the anatomic evaluations ( an ) separate from the other postprocessing methods obviously caused by the anatomic information. Automated pattern recognition ( pr ) is located between visual inspection ( e1 , e2 , and ea ) and spectral fitting ( fl , f1 , and f2 ). This indicates that pattern recognition is the closest method to the readers e1 and e2 .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AutomatedvsManualPatternRecognitionof3D1HMRSIDataofPatientswithProstateCancer/3_1s20S1076633212001031.jpg)
