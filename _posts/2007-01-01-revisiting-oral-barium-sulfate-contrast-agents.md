Oral contrast agents used during CT colonography (CTC) are valuable and may reduce false positive and false negative detections due to stool and residual fluid. Electronic cleansing algorithms are feasible, and oral contrast agents can eliminate the CTC requirement for a clean colon. Recent work shows oral contrast frequently adheres to polyps, with a preference for those with villous histology, a characteristic of advanced polyps. This finding encourages the development of contrast agents that highlight polyps at greatest risk for progression to malignancy. Our review summarizes numerous aspects of oral barium sulfate contrast agents as well as tests to assess adherence and coating ability of the agents, offering arenas to explore and tools for evaluation.

With the coming era of oral contrast-enhanced CT colonography (CTC, or virtual colonoscopy), this is an opportune time to revisit oral barium sulfate contrast agents. As stool and isoattenuating residual fluid are common causes of false negative and false positive detections during CTC, marking colon contents with oral contrast agents may improve the accuracy of CTC ( ). Indeed, studies using oral contrast agents have shown them to be valuable and suggest that they be routinely administered ( ). Electronic cleansing algorithms that remove opacified fluid are feasible and allow for three-dimensional endoluminal imaging of oral contrast−enhanced studies ( ). Oral contrast agents may also eliminate the requirement for a clean colon, as opacified stool and residual fluid can be distinguished either electronically or visually from polyps and normal colonic mucosa ( ).

The use of oral contrast agents to purposefully coat abnormal colonic mucosa during CTC has not previously been a subject of interest. However, recent research shows that oral contrast agents often coat polyps with a preference for those at risk for villous histology, a property of advanced polyps ( ). This finding may allow characterization of colonic mucosa at a level of detail smaller than generally thought possible with CTC.

In order to study oral contrast agents and their role as general opacification or targeted coating materials, it is necessary to review the complex formulation of their contents and address why they coat colonic mucosa. These questions have not been addressed for some time but have become relevant again with the use of contrast-enhanced CTC. Due to proprietary information restrictions, little is known about the exact ingredients and makeup of current oral contrast agents, leaving many questions to be answered by future research. Our review summarizes various aspects of oral barium sulfate preparations and provides possible arenas to explore when developing contrast agents that will preferentially adhere to polyps or normal mucosa.

## Oral barium sulfate solution basics

## Available Formulations

Oral barium sulfate contrast agents are available in powder or liquid forms; powders need to be reconstituted with water and liquids may need to be diluted. Barium sulfate agents are superior to water-soluble contrast media in their ability to define the mucosal surface and their resistance to dilution ( ). As the pH of the gastrointestinal tract may range from 0.8 to 8.0, different formulas have been created to optimize coating for specific studies ( ). Double contrast barium enemas (DCBEs, the study that approximates coating seen during CTC) usually use concentrations of barium sulfate in the range of 50−61% w/w or 80−100% w/v ( ).

There are many brands of barium sulfate available for clinical use. The major U.S. manufacturers are E-Z-Em (Lake Success, NY;  http://www.ezem.com/ ) and Tyco Healthcare (Mansfield, MA; Mallinckrodt subsidiary and Lafayette products, Hazelwood, MO;  http://imaging.mallinckrodt.com/ ).
