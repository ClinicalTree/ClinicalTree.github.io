## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to determine the prevalence and predictive value of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3, 4, and 5 findings on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to evaluate the impact of study indication on the predictive value of BI-RADS categories.

## Materials and Methods

This institutional review board approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant retrospective review of our breast MRI database from 2009 to 2011, of 5778 contrast-enhanced studies in 3360 patients was performed. At our institution, each breast receives an individual BI-RADS assessment. Breast MRI reports and electronic medical records were reviewed to obtain BI-RADS assessment, patient demographics, and outcomes. Univariate analysis was performed with Fisher exact and chi-square tests.

## Results

A total of 9216 BI-RADS assessments were assigned during the study period: 7879 (85.5%) BI-RADS 1 and 2, 567 (6.2%) BI-RADS 3, 715 (7.8%) BI-RADS 4, and 55 (0.6%) BI-RADS 5 assessments. The frequency of BI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 assessments was higher in studies performed for diagnostic (7.8%, 14.6%, 1.6%, respectively) than screening (5.2%, 4.0%, 0.1%) indications ( _P_ < 0.01). A total of 663 BI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions were biopsied with 209 (31.5%) malignant and 454 (68.5%) benign outcomes. The overall cancer rate for BI-RADS 3 findings was 1.9% (11 of 567) with no difference observed by study indication (diagnostic, 1.6%; screening, 2.3%; _P_ = 0.76). The positive predictive value (PPV2) of BI-RADS 4 and 5 was higher for diagnostic (29.1%, 154 of 530) than for screening (22.9%, 55 of 240) indications.

## Conclusions

Abnormal interpretation rates and PPV2 for MRIs performed for diagnostic indications are higher than for screening indications. Similar to mammography, breast MRI audits should be separated by study indication.

## Introduction

Contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive modality for detecting breast cancer . The modality is currently used both as an adjunct screening tool to mammography for the evaluation of asymptomatic women at high risk of breast cancer, as well as a diagnostic tool in other settings, such as assessment of the extent of the disease for known cancer diagnosis, surveillance after cancer treatment, or problem solving of inconclusive mammographic or ultrasound findings. To facilitate the increasing use of breast MRI in both the academic and community settings, the American College of Radiology (ACR) has provided recommendations for performing breast MRI in the screening and diagnostic populations and, in 2010, began an accreditation program for breast MRI facilities .

To obtain accreditation, breast MRI centers must use the ACR Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon in reporting breast MRI findings . They must be able to provide biopsy capabilities, either at their own center or a referring facility, for suspicious breast MRI findings recommended for biopsy. In addition, breast MRI centers are required to maintain a medical audit outcome program, which includes follow-up of positive BI-RADS assessments (BI-RADS 3, 4, and 5) and to provide a radiology-pathology correlation for biopsied findings on MRI .
