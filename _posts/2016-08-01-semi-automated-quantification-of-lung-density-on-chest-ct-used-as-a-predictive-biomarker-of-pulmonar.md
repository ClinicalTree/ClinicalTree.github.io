## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to determine if lung densities derived from computed tomography scans could be used to identify patients with pulmonary venous hypertension (Group II pulmonary hypertension \[PH\]), and to compare the performance of this metric with previously described metrics.

## Materials and Methods

Patients were retrospectively included from a single-center cohort of patients with aortic stenosis being evaluated for transcatheter aortic valve replacement from April 2009 to July 2014. Fifty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Thirty-three had PH (pulmonary arterial pressure \[PAP\] ≥25 mmHg). Thirty-two had Group II PH (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure \[PCWP\] ≥15 mmHg). Mean lung density (mLD) was measured from chest computed tomography scans using semi-automated techniques. Aortic diameter (mAo) and main pulmonary artery diameter (mPA) were measured manually. These metrics were correlated with PAP and PCWP values.

## Results

mLD was significantly correlated with PCWP (R = 0.45, _P_ = .0006) and significantly higher in patients with elevated PCWP ( _P_ = .006). mPA was weakly correlated with PCWP (R = 0.28, _P_ = .04), but not significantly different in patients with elevated PCWP. mPA/mAo was not significantly correlated with PCWP, nor was it significantly different in patients with elevated PCWP. mLD, mPA, and mPA/mAo were all significantly correlated with PAP and were significantly higher in patients with PH.

## Conclusions

Of all metrics, only mLD was significantly correlated with PCWP and served to differentiate patients with elevated and normal PCWP. As such, mLD may contribute to a noninvasive biomarker of pulmonary venous hypertension.

## Introduction

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a medical condition associated with high pressures in the pulmonary arteries. From the pulmonary arteries, blood travels through capillaries into pulmonary veins, and then into the left side of the heart from where it is pumped to the rest of the body. Causes of PH have been categorized into five groups by the World Health Organization : pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group I), PH due to left heart disease or pulmonary venous hypertension (Group II), PH due to chronic lung disease and/or hypoxia (Group III), chronic thromboembolic PH (Group IV), and PH due to unclear multifactorial mechanisms (Group V). The only cause of PH at a postcapillary level, and the most common cause of PH overall, is pulmonary venous hypertension (Group II), including diseases of the aortic and mitral valves .

The current gold standard test in the diagnosis of PH is to measure pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) using right heart catheterization. As an invasive procedure, the risks of right heart catheterization are low but not inconsequential—requiring proceduralist expertise. Serious complications including hematomas and arrhythmias have been reported in 1.1% of cases. Procedure-related deaths are uncommon but still occur at a rate of 0.055% .
