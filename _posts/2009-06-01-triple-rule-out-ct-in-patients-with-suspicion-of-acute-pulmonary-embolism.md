## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to prospectively investigate the diagnostic value of triple rule-out computed tomography (CT) in patients suspected of having acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 125 patients with suspicion of PE, of whom 14 patients had the additional clinical suspicion of acute aortic syndrome, underwent electrocardiogram-gated triple rule-out dual-source CT. The contrast media application protocol was adjusted to obtain a homogenous attenuation of the pulmonary arteries, thoracic aorta, and coronary arteries. The diagnostic performance of triple rule-out CT was assessed by using adjudicated discharge diagnoses as reference standards.

## Results

A total of 161 adjudicated cardiovascular discharge diagnoses were made in the 125 patients (including all true-positive and true-negative findings): acute PE was found in 26 (21%) and was excluded by CT in 99 (79%), coronary artery disease was found in 3 (3%) and was excluded by catheter angiography in 9 (6%), left ventricular systolic dysfunction was found in 2 (2%) and was excluded by echocardiography in 8 (6%), and acute aortic syndrome was found in 5 (4%) and was excluded by CT in 9 (7%) patients. Nonvascular chest disease was found in 34 (27%) and included pneumonia ( _n_ = 17), neoplasms (n = 5), fractures/osteolysis ( _n_ = 3), pericarditis ( _n_ = 2), and post-pneumonectomy syndrome ( _n_ = 1). Triple rule-out CT was normal in 53 (42%) patients. Overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of triple rule-out CT for cardiovascular disease were 100% (95% confidence interval \[CI\] 90–100%), 98% (95%CI 94–100%), 95% (95%CI 82–99%), and 100% (95%CI 97–100%, respectively).

## Conclusions

Triple rule-out CT is feasible in patients with suspicion of PE, reveals a wide range of vascular and non-vascular chest disease, and offers an excellent overall diagnostic performance.

The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a challenge because clinical signs and symptoms of PE are nonspecific . Various pathologies such as pneumonia, pneumothorax, pericarditis as well as more life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or acute aortic syndrome (AAS) may present with similar complaints, and an overlap between these diseases exists . Thus, a significant number of emergency department patients often receive simultanous testing for at least two of these diseases .

The probability of having PE is estimated based on the risk factors for thromboembolic events combined with the signs and symptoms of the patient. However, the estimation may be insufficient to rule out or to diagnose the disease with certainty. Thus, an imaging examination is often required to achieve a definite diagnosis . Currently, multidetector computed tomography (CT) with a non-electrocardiography (ECG)-gated, contrast-enhanced pulmonary angiogram represents the standard imaging modality when PE is suspected . However, pathologies involving the coronary arteries and aortic root, such as ACS and AAS, cannot be sufficently evaluated with a non–ECG-gated CT protocol because of cardiac motion artifacts.
