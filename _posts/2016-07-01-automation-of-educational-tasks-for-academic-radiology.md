## Rationale and Objectives

The process of education involves a variety of repetitious tasks. We believe that appropriate computer tools can automate many of these chores, and allow both educators and their students to devote a lot more of their time to actual teaching and learning. This paper details tools that we have used to automate a broad range of academic radiology-specific tasks on Mac OS X, iOS, and Windows platforms. Some of the tools we describe here require little expertise or time to use; others require some basic knowledge of computer programming.

## Materials and Methods

We used TextExpander (Mac, iOS) and AutoHotKey (Win) for automated generation of text files, such as resident performance reviews and radiology interpretations. Custom statistical calculations were performed using TextExpander and the Python programming language. A workflow for automated note-taking was developed using Evernote (Mac, iOS, Win) and Hazel (Mac). Automated resident procedure logging was accomplished using Editorial (iOS) and Python. We created three variants of a teaching session logger using Drafts (iOS) and Pythonista (iOS). Editorial and Drafts were used to create flashcards for knowledge review. We developed a mobile reference management system for iOS using Editorial. We used the Workflow app (iOS) to automatically generate a text message reminder for daily conferences. Finally, we developed two separate automated workflows—one with Evernote (Mac, iOS, Win) and one with Python (Mac, Win)—that generate simple automated teaching file collections.

## Results

We have beta-tested these workflows, techniques, and scripts on several of our fellow radiologists. All of them expressed enthusiasm for these tools and were able to use one or more of them to automate their own educational activities.

## Conclusions

Appropriate computer tools can automate many educational tasks, and thereby allow both educators and their students to devote a lot more of their time to actual teaching and learning.

## Introduction

Academic life and real life abound with a large number of dull and repetitious tasks. We believe that many of these tasks should be handed over to one's computer. This paper details a number of specific tasks that we have automated in our radiological lives, as well as the tools we have used to accomplish this.

Some tasks are quick and easy to automate. Others require a lot of time and programming skills. Thus, one of the very first decisions one needs to make is whether a given task is worth automating. The following diagrams from the xkcd website summarize this issue nicely (  Fig 1 ).
