## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this work was to compare a high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HR-DWI) acquisition (voxel size = 4.8 mm  3 ) to a standard diffusion-weighted imaging (STD-DWI) acquisition (voxel size = 29.3 mm  3 ) for monitoring neoadjuvant therapy-induced changes in breast tumors.

## Materials and Methods

Nine women with locally advanced breast cancer were imaged with both HR-DWI and STD-DWI before and after 3 weeks (early treatment) of neoadjuvant taxane-based treatment. Tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) metrics (mean and histogram percentiles) from both DWI methods were calculated, and their relationship to tumor volume change after 12 weeks of treatment (posttreatment) measured by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was evaluated with a Spearman's rank correlation.

## Results

The HR-DWI pretreatment 15th percentile tumor ADC ( _P_ = .03) and early treatment 15th, 25th, and 50th percentile tumor ADCs ( _P_ = .008, .010, .04, respectively) were significantly lower than the corresponding STD-DWI percentile ADCs. The mean tumor HR-ADC was significantly lower than STD-ADC at the early treatment time point ( _P_ = .02), but not at the pretreatment time point ( _P_ = .07). A significant early treatment increase in tumor ADC was found with both methods ( _P_ < .05). Correlations between HR-DWI tumor ADC and posttreatment tumor volume change were higher than the STD-DWI correlations at both time points and the lower percentile ADCs had the strongest correlations.

## Conclusion

These initial results suggest that the HR-DWI technique has potential for improving characterization of low tumor ADC values over STD-DWI and that HR-DWI may be of value in evaluating tumor change with treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are increasingly used to evaluate tumors in patients with locally advanced breast cancer who are undergoing neoadjuvant (preoperative) chemotherapy. Although change in tumor size is recognized as a surrogate predictor of response to chemotherapy , tumor morphologic changes tend to occur later in therapy and typically become apparent after biologic effects . Thus, there is an increasing clinical need to identify early markers for monitoring therapeutic response and improving treatment strategy.

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has shown promise as a potential imaging biomarker of early treatment response. DWI sequences use diffusion sensitizing gradients to detect differences in water mobility that reflect tissue microenvironment and microstructure. Unlike dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI, DWI has the advantage of not requiring the use of a contrast agent.
