## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to evaluate whether implementation of a low-dose computed tomography (CT)-guided lung biopsy protocol, with the support of individual radiologists in the section, would lead to immediate and sustained decreases in radiation dose associated with CT-guided lung biopsies.

## Materials and Methods

A low-dose CT-guided lung biopsy protocol was developed with modifications of kilovoltage peak, milliamperes, and scan coverage. Out of 413 CT-guided lung biopsies evaluated over a 3-year period beginning in 2009, 175 performed with a standard protocol before the development of a low-dose protocol, and 238 performed with a low-dose protocol. The dose-length product (DLP) was recorded for each lung biopsy and retrospectively compared between the two protocols. Individual radiologist level DLPs were also compared before and after the protocol change.

## Results

The mean biopsy dose decreased by 64.4% with the low-dose protocol (113.8 milligray centimeters versus 319.7 milligray centimeters; _P_ < 0.001). This decrease in radiation dose persisted throughout the entire 18 months evaluated following the protocol change. After the protocol change, each attending radiologist demonstrated a decrease in administered radiation dose. The diagnostic outcome rate and complication rate were unchanged over the interval.

## Conclusions

Implementation of a low-dose CT-guided lung biopsy protocol resulted in an immediate reduction in patient radiation dose that was seen with all attending radiologists and persisted for at least 18 months. Such an intervention may be considered at other institutions wishing to reduce patient doses.

## Introduction

The last decade has brought increased awareness of the cancer-inducing risks of radiation sustained from medical imaging, and with it, a movement to decrease doses from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) . CT-guided biopsies can result in high doses by virtue of the repetitive imaging required with some techniques ; however, biopsies are prime candidates for dose reduction because image quality is less of a concern when used solely for needle guidance.

Previous works have shown the success of low-dose protocols in a variety of procedural settings, including CT-guided spine procedures and CT-guided lung biopsies . However, the previous work with low-dose CT-guided lung biopsies was limited by small sample sizes, relatively short follow-up periods to evaluate dose reductions, and limited analysis of the effect of a standardized low-dose protocol on multiple operators. The present study examines the effect of a section-wide implementation of a low-dose CT-guided lung biopsy protocol in a high-volume referral center. This analysis includes an evaluation of the radiation doses over time and the radiation dose reductions achieved by individual attending radiologists.

Phase Coverage Slice Thickness Voltage Tube Current Planning Prior CTs should first be reviewed to select the optimal target. If the selected nodule is visible on the biopsy scout image, then coverage approximately 0.5 cm above and below the lesion is acquired. If the lesion is not visible on the scout, a slightly larger range is acquired based on landmarks from prior CT. 2.5 mm 100 kVP for patient weight <140 lbs and arms up
