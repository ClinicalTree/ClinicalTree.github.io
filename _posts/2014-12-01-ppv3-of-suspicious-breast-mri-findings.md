## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 4 and 5 lesions were evaluated to identify characteristics that may improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of a biopsy.

## Materials and Methods

MRI BI-RADS 4 or 5 breast findings in 101 women who underwent biopsy leading to a diagnosis of cancer within 1 year (PPV  3 ; _n_ = 115 cases) were reviewed. Patient history, lesion morphology, enhancement pattern and kinetics, and T  2 characteristics were examined.

## Results

The PPV  3 of all BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions seen on MRI was 22.6% (26 of 115). Excluding lesions with second-look imaging correlates decreased the PPV  3 to 11.8% (6/51). Of the MRI-guided biopsies, 20.9% (24 of 115) yielded a high-risk lesion, altering surgical management. MRI lesion type did not significantly affect the PPV  3 : the PPV  3 was 26.3% (15 of 57) for masses, 21.4% (9 of 42) for non mass enhancement (NME) and 12.5% (2 of 16) for suspicious foci. The PPV  3 for lesions found on diagnostic MRI in women with newly diagnosed cancer was 30.8% (20 of 65) which was statistically significantly greater compared to a PPV  3 of 11.9% (5 of 42) for lesions identified on high-risk screening MRI.

## Conclusions

Suspicious MRI findings identified on a second-look examination are more likely malignant than those seen only on MRI. Suspicious MRI findings discovered in patients with concurrent malignancy have a greater PPV  3 than those detected on high-risk screening MRIs. However, the type of MRI finding (mass vs. NME vs. foci) does not significantly affect the PPV  3 and should not be used as a discriminator for determining biopsy threshold.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive imaging tool in the detection and characterization of breast cancer . MRI is useful in the evaluation of women with a new diagnosis of breast cancer to determine the extent of disease and screen the contralateral breast when there is a new diagnosis . There is also evidence that supplemental screening with MRI when women have a lifetime chance of malignancy of 20% is beneficial . Breast MRI is highly sensitive but less specific than ultrasound (US) or mammography . As a result, the recommendation for biopsy of a suspicious lesion may yield cancer in a lesser percentage of patients than when mammograms or US are used to diagnose cancer. Therefore, suspicious MRI findings would be expected to have a decreased positive predictive value (PPV  3 ) when compared to the PPV for suspicious findings identified on mammography and US.

There are a number of MRI characteristics that are considered predictive of malignancy, such as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment , lesion size , enhancement pattern , and enhancement kinetics . However, there is considerable overlap between suspicious and benign MRI characteristics.

Both areas underwent MRI-guided biopsy. (a) Axial T 1 fat-saturated postcontrast subtraction image of a 75-year-old female with newly diagnosed left breast invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) demonstrates an additional suspicious finding in her contralateral breast. A focal area of clumped NME was seen in the right breast 9 o′ clock radian at middle depth ( arrow ). This NME was T 2 hyperintense and demonstrated moderate initial enhancement kinetics with plateau. There was no mammographic correlate. Histology from MRI-guided biopsy was malignant, demonstrating ILC and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). (b) Axial T 1 fat-saturated postcontrast subtraction image of a 46-year-old woman with newly diagnosed invasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) in the right breast. An additional lesion was found in the left breast ( arrow ) described as clumped heterogeneous NME. This finding was also hyperintense on T 2 and demonstrated rapid initial uptake of contrast with plateau enhancement kinetics. There was no mammographic correlate. Histology from MRI-guided biopsy was benign, demonstrating fibrocystic change and usual ductal hyperplasia.
