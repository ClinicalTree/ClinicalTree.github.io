## Rationale and Objectives

There has been attention on the job market recently and on radiology's supply/demand calculus. Supply is influenced by the number of trained radiologists, while demand is driven by demographics and technological innovation. We analyze the supply of radiologists historically and compare to other labor markets—medical and non-medical, domestic and foreign.

## Materials and Methods

We review National Resident Matching Program data in radiology and several other specialties from 1991 to 2015. We also review surveys, physician recruitment data, and peer-reviewed commentaries on medical specialty job markets. Trends are compared across specialties. The regulation of American medical training is compared to that in the United Kingdom and to a nonmedical labor market, unionized theatrical stage employees.

## Results

Radiology residency positions have increased since 1998 despite a downturn in the job market. This expansion coincides with a decreasing percentage of positions filled by domestic graduates. A similar trend has been seen in pathology, a notoriously oversupplied specialty. Conversely, other specialties have maintained their proportion of domestic graduates by way of limited supply or implicit demand.

## Conclusions

The radiology job market is currently oversupplied, primarily a result of increasing residency positions despite indicators of decreasing demand. The percentage of residency positions filled by domestic graduates has decreased during the same period, suggesting that medical student interest is responsive to the market. Other specialties, particularly pathology, demonstrate the dangers of chronic oversupply. We advocate a reduction of radiology residency positions such that supply closely approximates demand without exceeding it. Additional measures may be taken, if necessary, to restore market equilibrium in the event of a mild undersupply.

## The Radiology Job Market—a Historical Overview

Radiology training numbers have been influenced by technology, policy-driven reimbursements, and the economy in general.

Diagnostic radiology residency was extended from 3 to 4 years in 1982 . This corresponded with the introduction of magnetic resonance imaging, which emerged amid progress in computed tomography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, and digital subtraction angiography.

After varying degrees of reduction during the mid-1990s, the number of available positions has subsequently increased in all specialties. Apparent dramatic increases in radiation oncology (1996), plastic surgery (1996), and dermatology (1998) are the result of training pathway modification (i.e. subspecialty/fellowship changing to categorical residency).

Internal medicine and general surgery data represent categorical programs only, as preliminary (PGY-1 only) programs do not contribute to the graduating “workforce” of these fields. Continued residency expansion in the early 2010s appears to correlate with a decreasing proportion of domestic graduates, particularly in radiology and pathology.
