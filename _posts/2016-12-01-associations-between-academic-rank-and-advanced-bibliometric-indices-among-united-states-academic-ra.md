## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate associations between traditional and advanced bibliometric indices with academic rank for radiologists in the United States.

## Methods

Faculty web pages were searched to classify 538 members of the Association of University Radiologists as assistant ( _n_ = 212), associate ( _n_ = 128), or full ( _n_ = 198) professors. Radiologists' publication and citation records were extracted from Scopus to compute the following indices: publication count, citation count, h-index, i-10 index, h  c -index, m-quotient, e-index, and g-index. Analysis of variance, multivariable logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were performed.

## Results

All indices were significantly different among the three groups ( _P_ ≤.001), progressively increasing with increasing rank (eg, mean publication count of 17, 41, and 128 among assistant, associate, and full professors, respectively; mean citation count of 205, 687, and 3622, respectively; mean h-index of 5, 11, and 27, respectively). At multivariable analysis, the h-index (reflecting publications and citations) was a strong significant independent positive predictor of associate (β=+0.32, _P_ <.001) or full professor (β=+0.26, _P_ <.001) status, whereas the m-quotient (adjusted h-index that is greater for more rapid publication) was a strong significant independent negative predictor of associate (β=−1.87, _P_ = .009) or full professor (β =−4.97, _P_ <.001) status. The models exhibited moderate goodness-of-fit (r  2 = 0.534–0.655; _P_ <.001). The model for predicting at least associate professor achieved area under the curve 0.876 (sensitivity 74.6%, specificity 88.8%). The model for predicting full professor achieved area under the curve 0.925 (sensitivity 85.5%, specificity 86.1%).

## Conclusion

When controlling for the h-index, more rapid publication, as indicated by the m-quotient, was negatively associated with radiologists' academic rank, indicating the additional influence of career duration in promotions decisions.

## Introduction

Decisions by academic faculty regarding when to seek promotion, as well as decisions by institutional committees concerning when to award such promotions, are challenging. Faculty's peer-reviewed publication record is widely applied for guiding such processes. However, efforts to objectively assess one's publication record can be difficult as well given a paucity of data indicating the expected publication performance associated with various academic ranks in a given discipline. Such data could be useful for suggesting approximate benchmarks that could be applied as a guide when evaluating this one component of an academic physician's portfolio. A prior investigation of research output among academic radiologists identified both the number of publications as well as the h-index to be significantly predictive of academic rank . The h-index, first described by Hirsch in 2005 , is intended to improve upon deficiencies of the simple publication count by also reflecting citations to one's publications as a measure of impact. Specifically, the h-index is defined as the maximal number of publications that each has at least h citations , such that an investigator with an h-index of 15 has 15 publications with at least 15 citations, in addition to any number of additional publications with 15 or fewer citations. The h-index has similarly been demonstrated as a useful measure of academic performance in other medical disciplines and indeed has become recognized as a metric considered by promotions committees .

Although the h-index has performed favorably as a measure of academic performance, the h-index also has a number of its own limitations. Of note, it does not reflect a number of aspects of the timing of one's publications, such as the duration over which one produced publications or the recency of such publications . Also, the h-index does not reflect the number of publications having fewer citations than the h-index for the given individual, or the number of citations occurring beyond the individual's h-index. To address such concerns, an array of advanced bibliometric indices has been introduced more recently, including the i-10 index, h  c -index, m-quotient, e-index, and g-index. These advanced indices have received far less formal investigation than traditional metrics such as the publication count or h-index. However, one study suggested added value of some of these indices for predicting National Institutes of Health funding among radiological investigators . It is possible that these advanced indices could also serve as better predictors of academic rank and complement the traditional metrics in providing benchmarks associated with various academic ranks. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate associations among traditional and advanced bibliometric indices with academic rank for radiologists in the United States.
