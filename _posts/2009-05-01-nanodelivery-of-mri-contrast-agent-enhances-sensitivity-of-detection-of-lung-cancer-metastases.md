## Rationale and Objectives

Early detection of lung cancer can be problematic. Although current imaging methods can identify lung cancers, they are limited in the size of detectable nodules. There is also lack of evidence that these methods can correctly classify nodules <7 mm as malignant because lung cancer can be mimicked in appearance by benign lesions that lower specificity. Therefore, there is a need for enhanced sensitivity/specificity of detection for small lung cancers.

## Materials and Methods

We have developed a nanosized (∼100 nm) immunoliposome complex for delivery of molecular medicines to tumors. In this complex, an anti-transferrin receptor single-chain antibody fragment (TfRscFv) decorates the surface of a cationic liposome encapsulating the payload. We have previously shown that this systemically administered complex (scL) selectively targets, and efficiently delivers its payload into, tumor cells. We have also encapsulated the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent gadopentetate dimeglumine (“gad-d”) within this complex, resulting in increased resolution and image intensity in a mouse model of primary cancer. Here we examine the ability of the scL-gad-d complex to increase the sensitivity of detection of lung metastases.

## Results

These MRI studies show that the scL-gad-d nanocomplex is able to improve detection, and increase enhancement of, small lung cancers (400 μm and as small as 100 μm) compared to that of uncomplexed gad-d.

## Conclusions

Because of its tumor targeting specificity, deliver of an MRI contrast agent via this nanocomplex has potential for use as an agent that can identify small lung cancers, thus improving early detection and possibly increasing survival.

Lung cancer is the second leading cause of cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women, with the number of cases in women on the rise. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2008 there will be more than 215,000 new cases of lung cancer in the United States with more than 161,000 related deaths . The ratio of deaths to new cases (0.75) is significantly higher than the 0.4 ratio for cancer in general, indicating the dire prognosis of individuals who develop lung cancer and the importance of new approaches for early detection and diagnosis.

Currently the principal methods used for early identification of primary lung carcinoma are chest radiography and chest computed tomography (CT). Although both methods are somewhat effective in identifying curable lung cancer , they possess a major drawback in that they commonly result in false positives (ie, nodular areas that could indicate lung cancer, but are, in fact, scars or focal inflammatory/infectious processes) . For small lung nodules, this is a frequent occurrence and a serious problem. Although there are various diagnostic methods to distinguish between true malignancies and false positives , for small lung nodules, the primary method is to obtain serial images over time to assess growth, a very inefficient and costly process. Moreover, a recent report has associated the higher radiation dose from CT with an increased risk of cancer . Consequently, the need for multiple CT scans to confirm diagnosis may have a negative impact. There is also a risk entailed by delay in diagnosis. Cases with delays of 1 year have been associated with a change in stage (although delays of less than 6 months have not). This change in stage implies a worse prognosis . Furthermore, some small non–small-cell lung cancers can metastasize early .
