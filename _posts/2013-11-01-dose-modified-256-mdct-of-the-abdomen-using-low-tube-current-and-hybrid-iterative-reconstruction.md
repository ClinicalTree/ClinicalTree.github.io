## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the performance of hybrid iterative reconstruction technique (h-IRT) on image quality (IQ) in abdominal dose-modified (DM) scans in phantom and in patients in comparison to filtered back projection (FBP).

## Materials and Methods

An anthropomorphic phantom was scanned using various kVp (80–140) and mAs (25–100) settings. Images were reconstructed with FBP and h-IRT levels (1–6). In 69 adults (59.6 ± 13.54 years; 20 male, 49 female), DM computed tomography (CT) scans were performed using 120 kVp and 100–120 mAs. In 25/69, 5-mm FBP and h-IRT (levels 1–4 and 5) images were analyzed to validate IQ. The subsequent 44/69 had FBP and h-IRT (level 4) images reconstructed. Two readers evaluated 188 image series for IQ, noise, and artifacts. Objective and subjective data were analyzed using _t_ -test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. In 46/69 patients, prior dose CT was available for dose comparison.

## Results

In the phantom, noise reduction ranged from 12% (h-IRT level 1) to 50% (level 6). In patients, h-IRT level 4 images were rated diagnostic in 69/69 exams but DM-FBP images were found nondiagnostic in 20/69 patients. The size-specific dose estimate (SSDE) was reduced by 55% in the dose-modified CT group, (SSDE:4.55 ± 1.15 mGy) over the prior dose protocol (SSDE:10.21 ± 3.5 mGy, _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusion

h-IRT improved IQ in abdominal DM-CT scans in phantom and in patients. Dose improvements were greater in smaller patients than larger ones.

Since the introduction of CT scanners, technical advances in hardware and software have made its implementation possible in a variety of clinical conditions . These benefits of computed tomography (CT) imaging have also introduced new challenges of increased radiation exposure to the patients . The CT manufacturers and users have focused mainly on a tube current time product (mAs)-based approach to lower dose because of a predictable linearity between radiation dose and tube current and its straightforward application in practice. However, the lower image quality on the traditional filtered back projection (FBP) reconstructed scans performed using a substantially reduced dose remains a major limitation of dose-modified scans . Major CT manufacturers have introduced iterative reconstruction techniques (IRTs) to reduce noise and artifact to improve image quality .

Hybrid IRT (h-IRT, iDose  4 ) functions in the projection domain and in image space for suppressing image noise and artifacts and improving geometry through a complex mathematical algorithm. The noisiest signals in the areas of low photon counts are identified first in the projection domain and suppressed by the iterative reconstruction process; remaining noise is then propagated in the image domain, where it is easy to locate and remove . To our knowledge, this reconstruction technique has been studied on CT scans of the abdomen acquired with a low tube voltage (80-kV) approach in smaller sized adult patients and shown the promising results of decreasing both radiation dose and contrast media while preserving image quality . Tube voltage (kV) has a quadratic relationship with the dose; its modification therefore achieves greater dose savings than mAs having more linearity with the dose. Low kV is often applied in high-contrast examinations such as CT angiographies, CT urography, arterial phase acquisitions, or kidney stone evaluation, where higher image noise can be accepted. However, low kV is not routinely practiced in low-contrast studies such as portal venous phase scans because of image quality concerns and inadequate familiarity with optimal kV selection and corresponding tube current modifications to preserve the diagnostic quality in patients of medium to larger body size . Therefore, the purpose of our study was to investigate the performance of h-IRT on image quality in dose-modified CT protocols using a low mAs approach in a phantom and in patients in comparison to FBP.
