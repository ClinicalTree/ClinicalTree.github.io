## Rationale and Objectives

To examine the effects of the number of categories in the rating scale used in an observer experiment on the results of ROC analysis by a simulation study.

## Materials and Methods

We have previously evaluated the effects of computer-aided diagnosis on radiologists’ characterization of malignant and benign breast masses in serial mammograms. The evaluation of the likelihood of malignancy was performed on a quasi-continuous (0−100 points) confidence rating scale. In this study, we simulated the use of discrete confidence rating scales with fewer number of categories and analyzed the results with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology. The observers’ estimates of the likelihood of malignancy were also mapped to BI-RADS assessments with five and seven categories and ROC analysis was performed. The area under the ROC curve and the partial area index obtained from ROC analysis of the different confidence rating scales were compared.

## Results

The fitted ROC curves and the performance indices do not change significantly when the confidence rating scales were varied from 6 to 101 points if the estimated operating points obtained directly from the data are distributed relatively evenly over the entire range of true-positive fraction (TPF) and false-positive fraction (FPF). The mapping of the likelihood of malignancy observer data to the seven-category BI-RADS assessment scale allowed reliable ROC analysis, whereas mapping to the five-category BI-RADS scale could cause erratic ROC curve fitting because of the lack of operating points in the mid-range or failure in ROC curve fitting because of data degeneration for some observers.

## Conclusion

ROC analysis of discrete confidence rating scales with few but relatively evenly distributed data points over the entire FPF and TPF range is comparable to that of a quasi-continuous rating scale. However, ROC analysis of discrete confidence rating scales with few and unevenly distributed data points may cause unreliable estimations.

The effect of using quasi-continuous or discrete confidence rating scales on the results of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) observer study has been studied by a number of researchers. Rockette et al. ( ) carried out an observer experiment using both a 5-point discrete scale and a quasi-continuous 100-point scale. The results of ROC analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the performance index A  z achieved with the two scales. However, they suggested that the use of quasi-continuous scale can be more reliable for ROC analysis because it can avoid the problem of “degenerate” data sets.

King et al. ( ) performed an observer study to estimate the likelihood of the presence of abnormality on chest images using a quasi-continuous scale. Then they mapped the quasi-continuous observer ratings to a 5-point rating scale using two different sets of criteria for determining the range of each category and used ROC methodology to analyze the results. They concluded that the diagnostic accuracy derived from the quasi-continuous rating data are insensitive to the particular way those data are mapped to discrete categories. They also suggested that the use of a quasi-continuous scale is better in observer studies because of the insensitivity of the mapping to discrete categories and the reduced likelihood of “degenerate” data.

Mapping 1 LM 0 \[1, 2\] \[3, 70\] \[71, 100\] BI-RADS (r5) 1 2 3 4 5 Mapping 2 LM 0 \[1, 2\] \[3, 94\] \[95, 100\] BI-RADS (5) 1 2 3 4 5 Mapping 3 LM 0 \[1, 2\] \[3, 34\] \[35, 65\] \[66, 94\] \[95, 100\] BI-RADS (7) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

The first mapping \[BI-RADS (r5)\] is based on the definition given by an experienced MQSA radiologist in our institution. The second mapping \[BI-RADS (5)\] follows the definition of ACR breast imaging lexicon 2003 for the relation between the LM and the five-category assessments. The third mapping \[BI-RADS (7)\] also follows the definition of ACR breast imaging lexicon 2003 with the three additional subcategories for category 4.

The scales in terms of LM and BI-RADS are the original readings, LM-6 categories is the linear binning from the 101-rating scale to 6 rating scale shown in  Table 2  , the mappings LM→BI-RADS (r5) and LM→BI-RADS (7) are described in  Table 1  . The average A  z  values for the mapping LM→BI-RADS (5) are not shown because the MRMC program failed to converge for two of the radiologist readings (  Table 6  ).
