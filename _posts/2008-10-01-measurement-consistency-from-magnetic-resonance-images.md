## Rationale and Objectives

In quantifying medical images, length-based measurements are still obtained manually. Due to possible human error, a measurement protocol is required to guarantee the consistency of measurements. In this work, we review various statistical techniques that can be used in determining measurement consistency. The focus is on detecting a possible measurement bias and determining the robustness of the procedures to outliers.

## Materials and Methods

We review correlation analysis, linear regression, Bland-Altman method, paired _t_ -test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA). These techniques were applied to measurements, obtained by two raters, of head and neck structures from magnetic resonance images.

## Results

The correlation analysis and the linear regression were shown to be insufficient for detecting measurement inconsistency. They are also very sensitive to outliers. The widely used Bland-Altman method is a visualization technique, so it lacks the numeric quantification. The paired _t_ -test tends to be sensitive to small measurement bias. In contrast, ANOVA performs well even under small measurement bias.

## Conclusions

In almost all cases, using only one method is insufficient and it is recommended that several methods be used simultaneously. In general, ANOVA performs the best.

We were motivated in part by the need to establish a reliable measurement protocol of head and neck structures involving both bony and soft tissue structures from magnetic resonance (MR) images collected for the purpose of quantifying the growth pattern of various oral and pharyngeal structures or vocal tract structures ( ).  Figure 1 depicts a select set of such measurements obtained manually from MR imaging.
