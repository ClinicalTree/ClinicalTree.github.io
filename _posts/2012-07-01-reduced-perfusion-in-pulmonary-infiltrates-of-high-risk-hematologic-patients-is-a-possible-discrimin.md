## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess perfusion parameters in atypical pneumonia of heavily immunocompromised hematologic patients suspected of having invasive mycosis using volume perfusion computed tomography and establish their diagnostic role.

## Materials and Methods

Volume perfusion computed tomographic data from 21 consecutive immunocompromised patients presenting with atypical parenchymal opacity of consolidation were analyzed with respect to the degree of perfusion of their pneumonias. All patients presented with clinical and laboratory signs of infection. Seventeen patients (10 men, seven women; mean age, 57 years; age range, 19–76 years) were found with proven ( _n_ = 9), probable ( _n_ = 2), or possible ( _n_ = 6) angioinvasive mycosis. One patient was diagnosed with bronchoinvasive aspergillosis. Four patients (all men; mean age, 71 years; age range, 67–79 years) were diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. Volume perfusion computed tomography of the involved pulmonary areas was performed at 80 kV and 60 mAs, with 26 measurement points distributed over 65.9 seconds. Fifty milliliters of contrast material was injected at a rate of 5 mL/s, followed by a 50-mL saline chaser. Entire coverage of the pneumonic parenchymal consolidation was obtained in all patients, with the generation of parametric maps of blood flow (BF) using the maximal slope model and blood volume (BV) using Patlak analysis. The results of perfusion measurements were then analyzed and evaluated for all patients.

## Results

Patients with proven, probable, or possible angioinvasive pulmonary fungal infection revealed very low levels of perfusion of their parenchymal consolidations, with BFs ranging from 0.01 to 23.86 mL/100 mL tissue/min and BVs ranging from 0.88 to 10.67 mL/100 mL tissue, lower than those of the adjacent thoracic musculature and of bacterial pneumonias. Bacterial pneumonias showed all increased perfusion parameters, with BFs ranging from 30.49 to 41.65 mL/100 mL tissue/min and BVs ranging from 10.07 to 49.90 mL/100 mL tissue. The cutoff BF value for differentiation was 23.89 mL/100 mL tissue/min, and the cutoff BV value was 9.6 mL/100 mL tissue.

## Conclusions

Patients with angioinvasive pulmonary mycosis showed lower perfusion parameters on volume perfusion computed tomography compared to those experiencing bacterial pneumonia.

Patients with hematologic and oncologic malignant diseases necessitating high-dose chemotherapy with or without subsequent stem cell transplantation are at high risk for infections of the respiratory system. Among them, the pulmonary mycoses are the most devastating infectious complications . Despite introduction of antimycotic prophylaxis, the incidence of proven and probable fungal infections can still reach 24% among patients with leukemia . Mortality from fungal infections in immunocompromised hematologic patients depends on their extent (localized vs disseminated) and organisms’ aggressiveness and ranges between 40% and 50% in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, rising up to ≥70% for fusariosis and mucormycosis . Prophylaxis strategy with posaconazole in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or graft-versus-host-disease can be considered an effective treatment strategy by preventing invasive aspergillosis and reducing the rate of death related to fungal infections . However, the diagnosis of breakthrough fungal infections represents a new challenge to radiologists and has substantial importance for patient outcomes and health system costs.

Diagnostic confirmation of invasive pulmonary mycosis is often difficult, and definitive diagnosis must be made by histologic studies. Noninvasive radiologic diagnosis generally requires high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) imaging of the chest, which is superior to conventional chest radiography but is often also nonspecific .

Infiltration of the chest wall shows reactive rim of perfusion contrary to the pulmonary consolidation.
