## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the impact of low-concentration contrast medium on vascular enhancement, image quality, and radiation dose of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CCTA) by using prospectively electrocardiography (ECG)-triggered high-pitch spiral acquisition with low tube voltage in combination with iterative reconstruction.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred patients (body mass index ≤ 25 kg/m  2 , heart rate ≤ 65 beats per minute) were prospectively randomized to two groups, with 50 patients each, which were differed by contrast medium. All patients underwent prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral acquisition CCTA (2 × 128 × 0.6 mm, 300 mAs). Group A patients received iopromide 370 (370 mg I/mL), were scanned using 100 kVp, and reconstructed with filtered back projection. Group B patients received Iodixanol 270 (270 mg I/mL), were scanned using low tube voltage of 80 kVp, and reconstructed with iterative reconstruction techniques (IRT). CT attenuation was measured in coronary artery and other anatomic regions. Image quality score, noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and radiation dose were calculated and compared.

## Results

The iodixanol 270 group showed no significant difference in image quality score (1.61 ± 0.69 vs 1.57 ± 0.66; _P_ > .05), CT attenuation ( _P_ > .05), noise ( _P_ > .05), SNR (47.89 ± 14.03 vs 44.37 ± 12.79; _P_ > .05), and CNR (42.38 ± 12.67 vs 38.13 ± 11.38; _P_ > .05) in comparison to the iopromide 370 group but at a significantly lower radiation dose (0.26 ± 0.05 vs 0.57 ± 0.10; _P_ < .001), which reflects dose saving of 54.4%.

## Conclusions

Combining IRT with high-pitch spiral acquisition mode and low-tube-voltage technique, a low-concentration contrast medium of 270 mg I/mL can still maintain the contrast enhancement in coronary arteries without impairing image quality and significantly lower the radiation dose.

Coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography (CCTA) is a reliable and accurate method for diagnosis or exclusion of coronary artery disease. A large number of studies have investigated the diagnostic performance of CCTA among different generations of CT scanners . Although the high image quality and diagnostic accuracy are generally acknowledged, radiation exposure is of concern in CCTA . In a multicenter multivendor trial, Hausleiter et al. showed a median effective radiation dose of 12 mSv for CCTA with retrospective electrocardiography (ECG) gating using different types of 64-slice CT. With the introduction of post–64-slice CT technology, more dose-reduction strategies have been used to reduce radiation dose.

Various strategies and efforts are available to reduce the radiation exposure associated with CCTA. Examples include anatomic and ECG-dependent tube current modulation, reduced tube voltage , prospective ECG-triggering technique , and high-pitch spiral acquisitions . Prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral acquisition, which uses pitch values of ≥3.0, avoids overlapping radiation exposure. It also has been demonstrated that for selected patients, the combination of prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch acquisition with 100-kV tube voltage allows CCTA with a consistent effective dose of <1.0 mSv and high image quality . Another feasibility study by Schuhbaeck et al. even reported an average radiation dose of <0.1 mSv in a highly selected population (with body weight <100 kg, heart rate ≤60 beats per minute \[bpm\]) performed with a prospectively ECG-triggered high-pitch spiral acquisition mode with 80 kV and 50 mAs.
