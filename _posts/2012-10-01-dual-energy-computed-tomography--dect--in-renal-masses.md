## Rational and Objectives

To investigate whether a nonlinear-blending algorithm improves tumor conspicuity and image quality in the evaluation of renal masses at dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) during nephrographic phase of enhancement.

## Materials and Methods

The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study from archival material from patients consenting to the use of medical records for research purposes. A retrospective review of contrast-enhanced abdominal DECT scans in 45 patients (mean age, 59.5 years; range, 24–84 years) was performed. DECT data were reconstructed using nonlinear and linear blending. A region of interest was located within tumors and adjacent normal parenchyma; attenuation differences and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for renal masses on nonlinear- and linear-blended images. The two datasets were subjectively compared in terms of tumor detection and image quality. An exact Wilcoxon's matched pairs signed rank and marginal homogeneity tests were used to test whether differences in attenuation, CNR, and subjective assessment were greater using nonlinear blending.

## Results

The mean difference in attenuation for renal masses and adjacent portion of renal parenchyma was 138.4 Hounsfield units ± 28.9 SD using nonlinear blending, and 121.6 HU ± 18.0 SD using linear blending ( _P_ < .001). Mean CNR was 12.6 ± 2.5 SD using nonlinear blending, and 9.6 ± 2.2 SD using 0.3 linear-blended ( _P_ < .001). No significant difference in tumor detection was observed between the two algorithms. Image quality was significantly better ( _P_ < .001) using nonlinear blending.

## Conclusion

Compared with standard linear blending, nonlinear-blending algorithm improves tumor conspicuity and image quality in renal masses at DECT evaluation during nephrographic phase of enhancement.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) rose to prominence in the last decade thanks to its clinical value in the analysis of tissues chemical composition in applications such as automated bone removal , kidney stone characterization , gout detection , pulmonary embolism evaluation , endoleak detection , iodine removal and quantification (eg, in pancreatic and renal masses characterization, myocardial viability assessment and intracranial bleeding) . However, DECT imaging has other potential application than composition analysis. Most recently, great interest has been paid to the capability of improving image quality and tumor conspicuity at low-kVp DECT images in some clinical settings, such as hepatic and pancreatic masses evaluation . Operating at two different energy levels involves a continuous dilemma between the two main aspects—contrast resolution and noise characteristics of acquired images (ie, contrast-to-noise ratio; CNR). In particular, low-kVp (80-kVp) scanning provide higher contrast resolution and greater iodine conspicuity but results in excessively noisy images. Conversely, although high-kVp (140-kVp) scanning permits minimal noise levels, it provides lower contrast resolution and iodine conspicuity . A valuable compromise is represented by the possibility on dual-source (DS) DECT systems to blend low- and high-kVp information in a fused image dataset, resulting in a balance of both advantages and disadvantages. The first adopted strategy of image blending on DS-DECT was a linear blending approach in which 140- and 80-kVp images were combined in a fixed ratio. However, although linear blending provides an improvement in image quality, its downside is image contrast and conspicuity of lesions . Thus, as an alternative to linear blending, several nonlinear image-blending strategies have been developed ; preliminary studies showed that the sigmoid blending (referred to as moidal or sigmoid modified blending) is preferred by radiologists . To date, only a few studies in vivo, in which nonlinear and linear blending were compared in hepatic lesions, exist .

The aim of our study was to investigate whether a nonlinear-blending algorithm improves tumor conspicuity and image quality at DECT in renal masses evaluation during the nephrographic phase of enhancement.
