The Johns Hopkins University Press’ book _Questioning the Premedical Paradigm: Enhancing Diversity in the Medical Profession a Century after the Flexner Report,_ is a very detailed work and contains many references. It is a very portable book and the price quoted by the publisher was, I thought, quite impressive.

To me, the book was well-reflected by the title. Barr’s derivation within this book appeared methodical, although I would have preferred the research that he presents in the book to undergo the usual, classical multiple person, peer-review process such as with scientific journals. I am still not entirely clear on how he characterized what would define a “good physician” and thus any potential logical derivation of potential outcome is challenging.

My favorite part of the book was the section on the history of premedical education in the United States. It was captivating to consider how we have ended up where we are now. In particular, it was most interesting to me to read about the putative influences that may have influenced this process.

Overall, I thought that the book could have been much more efficient and shorter and I would have preferred for this to be one or more manuscripts submitted to academic-themed journals.
