## Rationale and Objectives

In an era of decreased reimbursements and rising expenses, academic health care systems are seeking alternative sources of funding. We hypothesized that the costs associated with disruptive physician behavior represented a source of potential savings and hence a possible financial stream which could be redirected to support other academic activities.

## Materials and Methods

To test this hypothesis, we reviewed costs associated with disruptive behavior in clinical and education settings and estimated their savings in academic health care systems.

## Results

In a 400 bed hospital, the combined costs for disruptive physician behaviors (due to staff turnover, medication errors and procedural errors) exceed $1 million.

## Conclusions

Reducing disruptive physician behavior in academic health care systems is a potential funding stream with the added benefits of improved patient safety, reduced medical errors and improved medical student/resident education.

In 2008, Joint Commission Sentinel Alert No. 40 was released . In this alert, disruptive behavior was linked to medical errors, poor patient satisfaction, preventable adverse outcomes, increased staff turnover, and higher costs of care, including malpractice. The Joint Commission recommended that hospitals establish a formal code of conduct. They also required leadership to create a process for reporting, evaluating, and managing disruptive behavior. The Joint Commission created a new leadership standard (LD.03.01.01) with two elements of performance (EP):

- **EP 4:** The hospital/organization has a code of conduct that defines acceptable and disruptive and inappropriate behaviors.
