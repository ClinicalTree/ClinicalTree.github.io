## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to evaluate in vitro stent lumen visibility of coronary stents in a second- and third-generation dual-source computed tomography (CT) system at 100 and 120 kVp tube potential.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-six coronary stents ranging from 2.25 to 4.0 mm in diameter were implanted in a coronary vessel phantom. Scans were performed at 100 and 120 kVp tube potential. Evaluation was performed using a medium-sharp kernel in both systems (B46f in the second-generation and Bv49 in the third-generation model) and a sharp (Bv59) convolution kernel optimized for vascular imaging in the third-generation CT.

## Results

The median visible stent lumen diameter in the second-generation system was higher at 120 kVp with a median of 62.0% compared to 56.3% at 100 kVp ( _P_ < 0.001). The median visible diameter in the third-generation system was significantly higher applying the Bv49 kernel with 66.7% at 120 kVp and 61.1% at 100 kVp (both _P_ < 0.001). When applying the Bv59 kernel, visible stent lumen further increased to 69.3% at 120 kVp and 66.7% at 100 kVp. Additionally, stent lumen was assessed using full width at half maximum, resulting in a comparable increase in luminal diameter at corresponding tube potential.

## Conclusions

Third-generation dual-source CT provides superior stent lumen visibility at equivalent tube potential and at reduced tube potential of 100 kVp when compared to 120 kVp in a second-generation system, at least when manually assessed.

## Introduction

An estimated 492,000 patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention in the United States in 2010 . In-stent restenosis is a major limitation of percutaneous coronary intervention, and although its incidence decreased with the advent of drug-eluting stents it remains in the range of 3%–20% . Several thousand coronary angiographies are performed each year to exclude in-stent restenosis, exposing the patient to the minor but definite risks of an invasive procedure. Thus, a noninvasive method for diagnosis or exclusion of in-stent restenosis is desirable.

Yet various stent materials cause different magnitudes of x-ray attenuation, leading to beam hardening and blooming artifacts, and eventually hindering stent lumen assessment. Previous studies have shown that computed tomographic angiography (CTA) might be an appropriate tool for visualization of coronary stents. However, image quality is strongly dependent on the material and architecture of the stents reviewed, as well as the technical capabilities of the computed tomography (CT) system used for evaluation .
