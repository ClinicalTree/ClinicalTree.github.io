## Rationale and Objectives

Sodium and proton magnetic resonance imaging (  23 Na/  1 H-MRI) have shown that muscle and skin can store Na  + without water. In chronic renal failure and in heart failure, Na  + mobilization occurs, but is variable depending on age, dialysis vintage, and other features. Na  + storage depots have not been studied in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI).

## Materials and Methods

We studied 7 patients with AKI (mean age: 51.7 years; range: 25–84) and 14 age-matched and gender-matched healthy controls. All underwent  23 Na/  1 H-MRI at the calf. Patients were studied before and after acute hemodialysis therapy within 5–6 days. The  23 Na-MRI produced grayscale images containing Na  + phantoms, which served to quantify Na  + contents. A fat-suppressed inversion recovery sequence was used to quantify H  2 O content.

## Results

Plasma Na  + levels did not change. Mean Na  + contents in muscle and skin did not significantly change following four to five cycles of hemodialysis treatment (before therapy: 32.7 ± 6.9 and 44.2 ± 13.5 mmol/L, respectively; after dialysis: 31.7 ± 10.2 and 42.8 ± 11.8 mmol/L, respectively; _P_ > .05). Water content measurements did not differ significantly before and after hemodialysis in muscle and skin ( _P_ > .05). Na  + contents in calf muscle and skin of patients before hemodialysis were significantly higher than in healthy subjects (16.6 ± 2.1 and 17.9 ± 3.2) and remained significantly elevated after hemodialysis.

## Conclusions

Na  + in muscle and skin accumulates in patients with AKI and, in contrast to patients receiving chronic hemodialysis and those with acute heart failure, is not mobilized with hemodialysis within 5–6 days.

## Introduction

Sodium (Na  + ) homeostasis in the body is important to blood pressure regulation, cardiovascular risk, and survival . However, measuring Na  + in the body has not been possible until the development of clinical Na  + magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) determinations. We observed earlier that Na  + is stored without commensurate water retention in skin and muscle . The local hypertonicity resulting from Na  + storage in skin leads to immune cell-driven induction of local tissue electrolyte clearance via modulation of cutaneous lymph capillary density . We found that disturbance of local tissue Na  + clearance from these stores is associated with salt-sensitive increases in blood pressure. Recent findings support the theory that skin electrolyte control, by lymph capillaries, is relevant for blood pressure homeostasis . The findings suggest that in addition to renal compensatory mechanisms, local clearance mechanisms at the tissue level are important for tissue electrolyte homeostasis. We recently implemented a  23 Na-MRI modality for noninvasive detection and quantification of Na  + reservoir metabolism in normal and hypertensive humans , in patients with hypernatremia , and in patients requiring chronic intermittent hemodialysis treatment . We used a specific coil for  23 Na-MRI using the upper calf as a target that allows skin and skeletal muscle to be investigated. During acute hemodialysis, the dialyzer assumes the fluid and salt-excretory function . We now investigated tissue Na  + contents in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) and tested the hypothesis that acute hemodialysis can mobilize Na  + from tissue stores presumably accumulated within a few days.

AKI is typically associated with an accumulation of Na  + (and Cl  − ) in the extracellular space . We observed that Na  + is deposited in skin and muscle physiologically; this occurrence is seen more often in patients with hypertension . The Na  + is bound to negatively charged glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, long-term balance studies have documented infradian rhythms in Na  + balance and excretion that are highly consistent with an additional Na  + storage compartment . We necessarily relied on animal studies involving carcass ashing and atomic absorption to delineate Na  + stores . The idea of using  23 Na as a target for molecular (atomic) imaging to transfer such data to humans is not new . Recently, various applications for  23 Na-MRI have been reviewed . Zaaraoui et al. showed that the distribution of brain sodium accumulation is correlated with disability in multiple sclerosis . Ouwerkerk et al. found an increased Na  + content in malignant breast tissue . Other studies concerned osteoarthritis and indicated that  23 Na-MRI has the potential to provide insight into muscle physiology . In our previous study in patients on maintenance hemodialysis, we showed that the time course of a 4-hour hemodialysis treatment was sufficient to lower the enhanced tissue sodium content rapidly to almost control level . Now, our aim was to determine whether the Na  + stored in skin and muscle tissue of patients with AKI could be reduced after acute hemodialysis therapy within the first 5–6 days. We developed  23 Na-MRI for our clinical purposes to study Na  + balance in disease states .

![Figure 1, The compartments of the lower leg were determined before ( left ) and after ( right ) acute hemodialysis treatment by a radiologist. The different anatomical regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn, guided by the anatomical image ( lower images : T1-weighted fast low-angle shot [FLASH] sequence). To measure the skin, one pixel was marked along the coil surface. Four tubes containing aqueous solutions with increasing Na + concentrations (10, 20, 30, and 40 mmol/L NaCl) were positioned in a custom-made device positioned inside the coil just below the patient's lower leg. Measurements of grayscale tube images served as calibration standards for Na + magnetic resonance imaging ( 23 Na-MRI) of the skeletal muscle and skin by relating intensity to a content in a linear trend analysis. For H 2 O quantification, the 10 mmol/L NaCl tube served as a calibration standard for tissue water in a linear trend analysis, defining a water content of approximately 1 L water per liter volume. ROIs: 1, skin; 2, triceps surae muscle (excluding areas containing vessels); 3, whole lower leg; 4–7, calibration solutions; 8, background noise.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/3Tesla23NaMagneticResonanceImagingDuringAcuteKidneyInjury/0_1s20S1076633217301770.jpg)
