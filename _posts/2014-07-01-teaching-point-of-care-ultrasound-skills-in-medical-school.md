## Rationale and Objectives

Ultrasound is used increasingly in medical practice as a tool for focused bedside diagnosis and technical assistance during procedures. Widespread availability of small portable units has put this technology into the hands of many physicians and medical students who lack dedicated training, leaving the education and introduction of this key modality increasingly to physicians from other specialties. We developed a radiology-led program to teach ultrasound skills to preclinical medical students.

## Materials and Methods

To develop this new ultrasound program we 1) established a program leader, 2) developed teaching materials, 3) created a hands-on interactive program, and 4) recruited the necessary instructors. The program was piloted with the first-year medical student class of 154 students. The introductory session was assessed by pre- and post-activity Likert scale–based surveys.

## Results

Of 154 (68.8%) students, 106 completed a voluntary online survey before starting the program and 145 students (94.2%) completed a voluntary survey after the session. Students found the program educationally valuable (4.64 of 5) and reported that it improved their understanding of ultrasound imaging (4.7 of 5). Students' reported confidence in identifying abdominal organs, intra-abdominal fluid, and Morison pouch that was significantly higher on the postactivity survey compared to the presurvey ( _P_ < .001 for all).

## Conclusions

We piloted a radiology-led program to teach ultrasound skills to preclinical medical students. Students found the experience enjoyable and educationally valuable.

Ultrasound has been a useful diagnostic imaging tool since the introduction of grayscale imaging in the 1970s. While originally the purview of radiologists, rapidly evolving technology, and smaller ultrasound units have put this imaging modality into the hands of a wider range of physicians including subspecialists closer to the point of service. Ultrasound is now used routinely by cardiologists, obstetricians and gynecologists, emergency medicine physicians, critical care physicians, surgeons, and hospitalists for point of care uses including focused diagnostics, as a physical examination adjunct, and for bedside procedure guidance . A portable ultrasound device is a far more accurate and powerful tool to identify a suspected pleural effusion, for example, rather than relying simply on a stethoscope. In 1988, ultrasound was called “the stethoscope of the future” in the Journal _Radiology_ and that future has largely arrived.

Although ultrasound can be a powerful tool, it is a complex imaging modality, and skillful interpretation and mastery takes years of specialized training. Formal diagnostic examinations, as well as ideally focused examinations, should be performed by imaging experts with specialized training in residency or fellowship. That said, targeted limited ultrasound examinations are already being performed routinely at the bedside by a wide array of physicians, often with little or no formal imaging training.
