## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence of totally implantable venous access devices, also called ports, implantation and the associated abnormalities in 2-\[  18 F\]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) images for patients with cancer, and to determine the percentage of abnormalities identified in the original reports.

## Materials and Methods

The study aimed to perform a retrospective review of all FDG PET-CT imaging in a 3-year period. Cases of port-associated abnormalities found on the FDG PET-CT images were identified and then correlated with X-ray reports and clinical treatment or follow-up.

## Results

In total, 2442 FDG PET-CT scans were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 897 (897 of 2442, 36.7%) demonstrated port implantation. Abnormalities, including 22 port fractures (22 of 897, 2.45%), 14 malposition (1.56%), one infection (0.11%), and one embraced by a fibrin sheath or tumor (0.11%) were found. Only the infectious one had clinical symptoms. Among the 22 fractured ports, eight fractured catheters migrated and became dislodged. All of the malpositioned ports, except two in the contralateral subclavian vein, were found in the ipsilateral jugular vein. Both the port infection and the port embraced by a fibrin sheath or tumor occurred at the tips of the devices, which demonstrated FDG uptake in the mediastinal region. Only seven of the 38 (18.42%) images of port abnormalities had been identified in the original reports.

## Conclusions

Based on this study, we recommend that the interpretation of FDG PET-CT scans should include a checklist to record all metallic device implantations and to interpret the whole-body X-ray topography as a standard part of PET-CT image report.

## Introduction

The use of totally implantable venous access devices, also called ports, provides long-term administration of chemotherapy agents to patients with cancer . The port consists of a radiopaque injection port and a silicon or polyurethane catheter; therefore, the integrity and the position of the catheter can be traced through a chest X-ray. It has been reported that port catheter fractures with fragment dislodgement occurred in 0.2%–2.1% of implantations . Port fractures may be asymptomatic, but they can be fatal in some cases. Other serious port complications that have been reported in the literature include infection, venous thrombosis, catheter leakage, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and cardiac perforation.

In the past 10 years, coverage of 2-\[  18 F\]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) procedures by health insurance companies and the commercial availability of FDG accelerated the prevalence of FDG PET-CT use for both cancer treatment monitoring and recurrent restaging. In the proposed FDG PET-CT procedure guidelines, the integrated PET-CT report should include any detected incidental findings from the CT scan that are relevant to patient care, even in the cases where the PET scans are negative .
