## Highlights

- Standardizing diagnostic test-related benefits and risks may improve decision making.

- Benefit-risk assessment (BRA) in diagnostic radiology involves multiple criteria.

- We propose a framework and process based on using standardized benefit-risk criteria (BRC).

- Multi-disciplinary teams of radiologists and imaging-ordering providers may improve decisions.

> A patient seeks diagnosis for non-specific, subacute low back pain. The patient has had non-specific pain for more than 3 months but has no history of structural problems or trauma, leg pain or red flags. You are asked to weigh the benefits and harms of two diagnostic approaches: Approach A: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Approach B: no additional diagnostic or therapeutic action (No Test) For each reason listed below select MRI if MRI offers an advantage over No Test, select No Test if No Test offers an advantage over MRI and select N/A if comparison is not possible or there is no meaningful difference between approaches.

![Figure 2, BRC selection framework illustrative example. BRC selection comprises several steps. In the first step, panel members vote on criteria for which there are differences between each of the pair of tests. This step is repeated until all pairs of diagnostic approaches (three pairs shown in this example) have been evaluated. In the next step, the votes are tallied and the criteria meeting the threshold of votes become relevant criteria. In the last step, the individual lists are collapsed into a single aggregated list of relevant BRC.
