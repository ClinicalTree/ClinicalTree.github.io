_High-Yield Imaging: Interventional_ is designed to be an accessible handbook for the study and practice of interventional radiology. Readers familiar with the large, two-volume textbook _Image-Guided Interventions_ will recognize this handbook as a distillation of that reference text. For this new entry to Saundersâ€™s _High-Yield Imaging_ series, authors Dr Charles Burke and Dr Robert Dixon (both of whom are interventional radiologists and faculty members at the University of North Carolina) extracted the essential information, organized it into a bulleted-text format that is succinct and easily navigable, and updated the selection of images.

The result is a text that manages to be comprehensive yet reasonably concise. Both vascular and nonvascular procedures are well represented. Specifically, 111 chapters are devoted to vascular interventions, while another 52 chapters are dedicated to nonvascular procedures. Each chapter adheres to a consistent format, beginning with a list of indications and contraindications, a list of the necessary equipment, and a brief overview of the relevant anatomy. Next, the steps of the procedure are described in clear, sequential fashion, and any controversies or topics of special concern are reviewed. Finally, brief descriptions of outcomes, potential complications, and recommended follow-up care are provided, as well as an up-to-date bibliography. Nearly 1000 high-quality, multimodality images are provided, with annotations. Despite covering so much material, the authors leverage the lean, bulleted format to prevent the handbook from becoming overly long. A facile reader can review each chapter in just a few minutes, and the book itself is of appropriate size and weight to carry in a backpack.

There is ample coverage of oncointervention, with nearly 26 chapters devoted to various transarterial, transvenous, endoluminal, and percutaneous interventions. Another 10 chapters are dedicated to reviewing head and neck procedures, including management of acute stroke. Additionally, there are seven chapters spent on pain management procedures, which traditionally have been underrepresented in the interventional radiology literature.

Access to the online resource Expert Consult is included with each copy of the text via a scratch code on the inside cover. Registered users are provided with access to a searchable, online version of the full text as well as a downloadable image bank. Finally, links are provided to PubMed abstracts for most bibliographic references.

Although the subject matter likely is too advanced for most medical students, High _-Yield Imaging: Interventional_ is an excellent resource for radiology residents and interventional radiology fellows; the concise format lends itself to brief review between cases, while the carefully resourced bibliographies provide opportunities for more in-depth study. Practicing general radiologists and even subspecialists in interventional radiology may also benefit from the succinct and evidence-based review of interventional techniques provided by this handbook.

In summary, _High-Yield Imaging: Interventional_ is a concise review of image-guided vascular and nonvascular procedures. This textbook is recommended to any radiologist who is involved in interventional radiology or minimally invasive procedures, from beginning residents to academic subspecialists or experienced private practitioners.
