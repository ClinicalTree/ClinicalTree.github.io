## Rationale and Objectives

The assessment of the therapeutic response of high-grade gliomas treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) using temozolomide is difficult because of the frequent occurrence of early imaging changes that are indistinguishable from tumor progression, termed pseudoprogression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diffusion-weighted imaging could be used to differentiate true progression and pseudoprogression.

## Materials and Methods

Magnetic resonance images and diffusion-weighted images obtained within 2 months of CCRT completion in patients with high-grade gliomas were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 22 patients with increases in measurable enhancing regions were identified and classified into true progression and pseudoprogression groups on the basis of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance images obtained 12 weeks after CCRT. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient maps, respectively, was performed to discriminate true progression and pseudoprogression. Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test, unpaired _t_ tests, and receiver-operating characteristic analysis.

## Results

The true progression group showed a higher incidence of homogeneous or multifocal high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted images (seven of 10 patients \[70%\]), whereas rim high or no high signal intensity (10 of 12 \[83%\]) was observed in the pseudoprogression group ( _P_ = .027). True progression was defined by newly appearing or enlarged enhancing lesions with mean apparent diffusion coefficient values of 1200 × 10  −6 mm  2 /s inside the radiation field after CCRT; the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 80% (eight of 10), 83.3% (10 of 12), and 81.2% (18 of 22), respectively.

## Conclusions

The assessment of diffusion-weighted images for patients with increases of measurable enhancing regions 2 months after CCRT completion is useful for differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. The current standard care for newly diagnosed GBM includes postoperative concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with temozolomide (TMZ) followed by maintenance TMZ, which significantly prolongs overall survival compared to radiation alone . Assessment of the response to treatment and disease progression, which includes variations in the contrast-enhancing tumor volume on radiologic imaging, neurologic function, and steroid dosage, is based on the criteria defined by Macdonald et al in 1990. However, this traditional method of measuring the enhancing tumor may not assess the true treatment response, particularly with pseudoprogression of high-grade gliomas after CCRT.

Pseudoprogression has been recognized and widely accepted to occur in the treatment of high-grade gliomas, as transient increases of the enhancing area usually <3 months after CCRT . This phenomenon was originally reported by Hoffman et al in 1979 and more fully described by de Wit et al in 2004 as the early tumor bed enhancement of high-grade gliomas treated with radiation therapy with or without carmustine. More recently, this was better defined in the era of the currently used TMZ regimen . Recent reports suggest that up to 30% of patients treated with this regimen may develop lesion changes that mimic early tumor progression on standard contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging . This treatment-related change has implications for patient management and may result in premature discontinuation of effective adjuvant therapy. The absence of reliable and accepted imaging methods and biochemical markers to discriminate pseudoprogression from true progression further challenges its diagnosis.
