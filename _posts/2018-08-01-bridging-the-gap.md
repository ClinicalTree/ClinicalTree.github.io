## Rationale and Objectives

Women make up half of American medical school graduates, but remain underrepresented among radiologists. This study sought to determine whether workforce gender disparities exist in other countries, and to identify any country-specific indices associated with increased female representation.

## Materials and Methods

In this cross-sectional study, 95 professional radiology organizations in 75 countries were contacted via email to provide membership statistics, including proportion of female members, female members aged 35 or under, and women in society leadership positions. Country-specific metrics collected included gross domestic product, Gini index, percent female medical school enrollment, and Gender Development Index for the purposes of univariate multiple regression analysis.

## Results

Twenty-nine organizations provided data on 184,888 radiologists, representing 26 countries from Europe ( _n_ = 12), North America ( _n_ = 2), Central/South America ( _n_ = 6), Oceania ( _n_ = 2), Asia ( _n_ = 3), and Africa ( _n_ = 1) for a response rate of 34.7% (26/75). Globally, 33.5% of radiologists are female. Women constitute a higher proportion of younger radiologists, with 48.5% of radiologists aged 35 or under being female. Female representation in radiology is lowest in the United States (27.2%), highest in Thailand (85.0%), and most variable in Europe (mean 40.1%, range 28.8%–68.9%). The proportion of female radiologists was positively associated with a country's Gender Development Index ( _P_ = .006), percent female medical student enrollment ( _P_ = .001), and Gini index ( _P_ = .002), and negatively associated with gross domestic product ( _P_ = .03).

## Conclusions

Women are underrepresented in radiology globally, most notably in the United States. Countries with greater representation of women had higher gender equality and percent female medical school enrollment, suggesting these factors may play a role in the gender gap.

## Introduction

In recent decades, representation of women in medicine has increased dramatically, as evidenced by the fact that 48% of all American medical school graduates were female in 2014 . Women constitute 46% of all resident physicians, and they have achieved parity or are the gender majority in pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, pathology, family medicine, and psychiatry .

Despite such progress, gender gaps remain. Only 38% of faculty positions, 21% of full professorships, and 16% of deanships at American medical schools are held by women . Female physicians have lower mean unadjusted salaries than male physicians . Furthermore, female gender distribution among specialties is uneven, ranging from 60.4% in pediatrics to 4.6% in orthopedic surgery . Although female medical school graduates are increasingly entering specialties in which they were historically underrepresented, large gender disparities remain, most notably in the surgical subspecialties and diagnostic radiology. According to a 2016 report by the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 24.7% of active radiologists in the United States are female . This is in keeping with survey data from the American College of Radiology, finding that only 22% of the US radiology physician workforce was female in 2014 . Compared to all specialties, radiology has one of the lowest proportions of full-time female faculty at 28%, better only than orthopedic surgery (16%) and general surgery (22%) . Of note, in the case of general surgery, the percentage of female residents is substantially higher at 38% . A 2016 review of 51 major academic radiology faculty rosters in the United States reported that only 25% of vice chairs and section chiefs and 9% of department chairs were women .

The situation is \[worrisome\] because the number of women is increasing, but positions of responsibility are still occupied by men. Men do not feel the need to provide nurseries to facilitate women's family \[relationships\]. Although women are slowly occupying top positions in radiology, the proportion is still far from what it should be. The number of women in interventional radiology is also much smaller \[than men\]. We should not be naive and think that the solution will be solved just because the total number of women is high.
