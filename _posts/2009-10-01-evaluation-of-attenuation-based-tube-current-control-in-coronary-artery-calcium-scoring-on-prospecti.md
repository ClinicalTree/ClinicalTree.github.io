## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to investigate image noise (standard deviation of computed tomographic value) and to assess variability in repeated coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring on prospective electrocardiographically triggered 64-detctor computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Patients ( _n_ = 428) suspected of having coronary artery disease were scanned twice using three protocols: with tube current modified by body mass index (BMI; group A), by BMI and body height (group B), and by attenuation at the maximal heart diameter (group C). Image noise was plotted against BMI. Interscan variability of CAC scores was determined. The effective dose was estimated by computed tomographic dose index.

## Results

The mean effective dose and image noise, respectively, were 0.9 ± 0.2 mSv (range, 0.6–1.5 mSv) and 19 ± 4 Hounsfield units (HU) (range, 10–32 HU) for group A; 0.8 ± 0.2 mSv (range, 0.5–1.4 mSv) and 18 ± 4 HU (range, 10–31 HU) for group B; and 0.8 ± 0.4 mSv (range, 0.3–2.2 mSv) and 20 ± 2 HU (range, 16–26 HU) for group C. Group C used a wide dose range and controlled noise within a small range. The positive slopes of image noise versus BMI, 0.81 HU/(kg/m  2 ) in group A and 0.62 HU/(kg/m  2 ) in group B, suggested insufficient control of the tube current. In contrast, the nearly flat slope in group C, 0.091 HU/(kg/m  2 ), indicated optimal control. The interscan variability for Agatston score, volume, and mass in patients with CAC ( _n_ = 300) was 13% (median, 8%), 12% (median, 7%), and 11% (median, 6%), respectively.

## Conclusions

CAC scoring on prospective electrocardiographically triggered 64-detector computed tomography using attenuation-based tube current control has the potential to favorably control image noise with low dose and low interscan variability.

The validity of serial coronary calcium measurements as a method to monitor the progression of atherosclerosis requires that the progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) have biologic relevance to atherosclerosis activity, the progression of CAC can be detected relative to intertest variability, changes in CAC severity have prognostic relevance, and the modification of cardiovascular risk factors modulate the progression of CAC . Therefore, regarding the technical aspects of CAC scoring, low radiation exposure and low interscan variability are key requirements.

To reduce radiation exposure, a fixed and lower tube current–time product of 40 mAs or 55 mAs and body weight–adapted or body mass index (BMI)–adapted protocols have been introduced, but these do not account for the body habitus of patients, such as the size of heart or the presence of pericardial effusion. In a recent report of the International Consortium on Standardization in Cardiac Computed Tomography, a standard deviation (SD) level target of 20 Hounsfield units (HU) for small and medium-sized patients and an SD level target of 23 HU for large patients have been recommended . Mühlenbruch et al reported automated attenuation-based tube current adaptation whereby the tube current was chosen from a proprietary control curve calculated on the basis of the attenuation values derived from the scanogram. Their study showed that automated attenuation-based tube current adaptation can better control tube current than a fixed “standard” dose protocol, but their regression analysis revealed a statistically significant influence of patient BMI on image noise.

This was based on the strategy that patients with standard BMIs of 25 kg/m  2 would receive tube current–time product of 58 mAs, which is almost the same level as the recommendation for CAC scoring using low-dose 4-slice CT imaging .

The grids (dotted lines) show that the isocenter of the x-ray beam is 2 cm higher than the center of body (black line) in the ventral-dorsal direction at the left ventricular level. The table is elevated by 2 cm so that the isocenter of the x-ray beam and the center of the body correspond. Next, the frontal scout view is taken. The z-axis level of the maximal heart diameter on the frontal scout view is chosen (b) , and a targeted noise level of 20 HU is input into the software Smart mA. Then, a recommended value for the tube current is displayed. Because this value is offered on the simulation of a full scan and a gantry rotation speed of 0.4 seconds, the tube current for coronary artery calcium scanning is determine according to the following equation: tube current = recommended tube current × (3/2) × (0.4/0.35) mA.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EvaluationofAttenuationBasedTubeCurrentControlinCoronaryArteryCalciumScoringonProspectiveECGtriggered64detectorCT/0_1s20S1076633209002621.jpg)
