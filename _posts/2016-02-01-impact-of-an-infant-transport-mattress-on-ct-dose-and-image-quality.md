## Rationale and Objectives

Neonates are at increased risk for cold stress and hypothermia in cool environments. An infant transport mattress (ITM) is commonly used to increase neonate temperature during transport and has been used during CT scanning. This study determined the impact of an ITM on radiation dose and image artifacts during CT scanning.

## Materials and Methods

CT images from a single clinical patient scanned with an ITM were reviewed, and observations of image artifacts were recorded. A phantom was scanned with and without the ITM while varying tube-current modulation, reconstruction method, slice thickness, metal reduction algorithm, tube voltage, and tube current. The effects of the ITM on computed tomography dose index (CTDI  vol ), mean Hounsfield unit (HU), and HU standard deviation were recorded.

## Results

The clinical patient scan demonstrated significantly decreased mean HU and increased HU standard deviation. In the phantom, the ITM increased CTDI  vol 27% and induced an artifact that decreased the mean HU by 3.5 HU and increased HU standard deviation by 4.6 HU. Angular tube-current modulation, strong iterative reconstruction, thick slices, metal artifact reduction, and high mA reduced the artifact.

## Conclusion **s**

Using ITM during CT scanning is not recommended given the relatively brief scanning time, increased dose, and induced image artifacts. Based on our results, several acquisition parameters may be altered to mitigate the image artifact if an ITM is required during scanning.

## Introduction

Thermal maintenance of the patient is an essential aspect of neonatal care, especially in pre-term and low birth weight infants . Cold stress and possible hypothermia due to loss of thermal maintenance can contribute to increased morbidity and mortality . Previous studies have demonstrated that covering the patient with a polyethylene wrap immediately after birth reduces cold stress and rates of hypothermia among neonates in the delivery room . Similarly, a specially designed warming infant transport mattress (ITM) placed under the neonate during transport has been shown to increase admission temperature and decrease the incidence of hypothermia . The use of a polyethylene or a warming mattress has also been endorsed by the American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatric . In a survey of English neonatal units, 25.2% of units employed a warming mattress either alone or in conjunction with a polyethylene wrap for premature infants .

Little information currently exists related to neonatal cold stress and hypothermia during imaging. One brief study from 1980 suggests using a warming mattress during computed tomography (CT) scanning to decrease cold stress and the chance of hypothermia; however, studies using modern CT technology do not exist. Modern CT scanners implement several automatic exposure control technologies to reduce patient radiation dose and improve image quality. Although these technologies typically lead to reduced patient radiation dose, it is possible that the presence of a foreign object could confuse the automatic exposure control algorithms leading to increased patient radiation dose. Further, a foreign object could alter beam characteristics and cause image artifacts .
