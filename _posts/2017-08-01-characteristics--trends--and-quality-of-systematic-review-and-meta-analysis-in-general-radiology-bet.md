## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the trends, characteristics, and quality of systematic review and meta-analysis in general radiology journals.

## Materials and Methods

We performed a PubMed search to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses that had been carried out in the field of radiology between 2007 and 2015. The following data were extracted: journal, impact factor, type of research, year of publication, radiological subspecialty, imaging modalities used, number of authors, affiliated department of the first and corresponding authors, presence of a radiologist and a statistician among the authors, discordance between the first and corresponding authors, funding, country of first author, methodological quality, methods used for quality assessment, and statistics.

## Results

Ultimately, we included 210 articles from nine general radiology journals. The _European Journal of Radiology_ was the most common journal represented (47 of 210; 22.4%). Meta-analyses ( _n_ = 177; 84.3%) were published about five times more than systematic reviews without meta-analysis ( _n_ = 33; 15.7%). Radiology of the gastrointestinal tract was the most commonly represented subspecialty ( _n_ = 49, 23.3%). The first authors were most frequently located in China ( _n_ = 64; 30.3%). In terms of modality, magnetic resonance imaging was used most often ( _n_ = 59; 28.1%). The number of authors tended to progressively increase over time, and the ratio of discordance between the first and corresponding authors also increased significantly, as did the proportion of research that has received funding from an external source. The mean AMSTAR assessment score improved over time (5.87/11 in 2007–2009, 7.11/11 in 2010–2012, and 7.49/11 in 2013–2015). In this regard, the journal _Radiology_ had the highest score (7.59/11).

## Conclusions

The quantity and quality of radiological meta-analyses have significantly increased over the past 9 years; however, specific weak areas remain, providing the opportunity for quality improvement.

## Introduction

To evaluate all of the information that has been gathered to date on a particular topic, researchers often perform a systematic review. In a systematic review, researchers identify and screen relevant research articles; they then review and analyze data from the screened research to evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions or the accuracy of diagnostic tests . Meta-analysis is a kind of systematic review that uses statistical methods to integrate data from multiple primary studies. Recently, the need for systematic review and meta-analysis in radiological literature has increased because imaging modalities and technology have improved rapidly, and our understanding of evidence-based medicine has increased.

Systematic review and meta-analysis can increase the validity and reduce the bias of the primary studies by integrating the results of multiple studies . In this way, appropriately performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide better quality results. Nonetheless, several published systematic reviews and meta-analyses have used an inappropriate study design .
