## Rationale and Objectives

Academic radiologists commonly hold multiple simultaneous roles within the landscape of physician training. This paper analyzes theoretical scenarios describing relationships between medical students, residents, and physician educators in radiology.

## Materials and Methods

The scenarios presented involve medical student supervision, radiology resident recruitment, and resident termination with respect to relevant ethical, regulatory, and legal considerations. Legal precedents and the medical social contract are addressed.

## Results

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act defines a framework for the privacy practices of medical schools, but it does not confer individual rights. Resident physicians rarely win wrongful termination lawsuits. Physician educators are ethically bound to act in the best interest of society.

## Conclusions

Courts have ruled that medicine is intended to be a self-regulatory profession. Such a power requires that physicians remain accountable to the public while providing a fair learning environment for medical trainees.

Medical education represents a complex confluence of learners at many different educational levels. The physician educator is thus often forced to juggle the educational needs and rights of stakeholders who in many cases are accountable to different agencies. Consider the following theoretical scenarios as they relate to academic radiology.

## Scenario 1: Medical Student Education and Privacy

A medical school receives funding from the United States Department of Education, and this school's policy dictates that grades of its students are posted publicly according to randomized codes. A radiology clerkship coordinator mistakenly posts a list of radiology clerkship grades of fourth year medical students by code but in alphabetical order thereby making it clear which code has been ascribed to each student over the entire course of medical school. Students disseminate the information on social media. A student in the class whose privacy has been breached complains to school officials and threatens legal action.
