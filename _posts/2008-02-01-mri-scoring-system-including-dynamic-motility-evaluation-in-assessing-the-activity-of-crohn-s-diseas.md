## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to investigate the value of a MRI scoring system including dynamic motility evaluation in the assessment of small bowel Crohn’s disease activity.

## Materials and Methods

From March 2005 to December 2006, 52 patients with suspected Crohn’s disease onset or relapse underwent MRI on a 1.5-T magnet. Bowel distention was achieved orally assuming a mean of 1.6 L of a polyethyleneglycol (PEG) preparation. Per-patient assessment of disease activity was based on a scoring system including evaluation of morphology and motility of the small bowel and perivisceral structures (true-FISP, cine-true-FISP, and HASTE T2W sequences) and dynamic assessment of parietal contrast enhancement (FLASH T1W sequence). Patients were included in three categories, using endoscopic biopsy as the standard reference: no activity/quiescent disease, mild activity, or moderate-to-severe activity. Patients without terminal ileum involvement were excluded from data analysis.

## Results

MRI allowed a detailed and panoramic evaluation of the small bowel in all subjects examined. MRI properly assessed 14 of 16 (87.5%) cases of no activity/quiescent disease, 12 of 14 (85.7%) cases of mild activity, and 15 of 15 (100%) cases of severe activity. Overall, activity score led to a per-patient misdiagnosis of disease activity in a nonsignificant proportion of subjects (4 of 45; 8.8%) ( _P_ \> .05), determining two false-positive and two false-negative results of mild disease activity. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and overall accuracy in assessing disease activity were 93.1%, 87.5%, 93.1%, 87.5%, and 91.1%, respectively.

## Conclusion

Accurate assessment of Crohn’s disease activity is achieved by using an activity score providing an overall interpretation of MRI findings.

Crohn’s disease is a major inflammatory bowel disorder characterized by a chronic and relapsing course ( ). Assessment of inflammatory activity plays a crucial role in planning the patient’s management and in monitoring the effects of therapy ( ). To date, there are no standardized methods for the assessment of intestinal disease activity in Crohn’s disease ( ). Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) ( ), the most widely used clinical scoring, is not universally accepted as it is based predominantly on subjective evaluation of clinical symptoms ( ). In clinical practice, biologic indexes (such as WBC, erythrrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, or orosomucoids) have been found to be accurate predictors of disease activity, especially when supported by endoscopy and imaging results ( ). Therefore, clinical activity is currently assessed using a combination of clinical and physical findings, laboratory tests, endoscopy, and imaging procedures, including CT ( ), small bowel enteroclysis or follow-through ( ), sonography ( ), MRI ( ), and leukocyte scintigraphy or positron emission tomography ( ).

Over the past years, technical developments allowed MRI to provide panoramic and detailed representation of the small bowel, becoming one of the most promising imaging tools in evaluating Crohn’s disease. Accuracy in diagnosing Crohn’s disease has been proven to be comparable ( ) or superior ( ) to conventional radiographic methods, such as enteroclysis or follow-through techniques, with the advantage of the lack of ionizing radiation exposure and the added value of evaluating extraluminal structures. Moreover, small bowel MRI has been shown to be useful in assessing disease activity ( ) and monitoring the effects of therapy ( ).
