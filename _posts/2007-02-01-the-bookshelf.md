Here he comes again. Alex Margulis has not slowed down. He is seeing patients, teaching medical students and residents, lecturing around the world, and writing about things he can share from his career as the chairman of what he built into one of the major academic radiology departments in the country.

For good reason, he is recognized as one of the most astute managers in radiology, in academic medicine or in the broader milieu of university politics. Five years ago, he produced a slender volume _Be In Charge_ , wherein he offered pithy observations about management style. After a slow start, that book did well and he got comments that prompted the current volume. There is a market for advice for established bosses. Think of how much bigger the market is for aspiring bosses who are starting up the ladder in academia or in business. So this is a book for the “wannabes.”

The style is much the same. Some 22 brief chapters begin by asking if the reader really wants to climb the management ladder and end with a discussion of planning for retirement. Here are the bits of advice that, if taken to heart, will help to avoid potholes on the road to success. As simple a point as: if you go to dinner with your boss, do not drink more than he does. Don’t gossip about the boss, even with your best friend. Somehow, it gets back to him and it is remembered more clearly than any of your achievements. If the boss acts on your suggestion, he will take credit for any success and share with you any blame for failure. Suggestions are offered about how to avert that situation without getting caught at it.

In his previous book, Dr. Margulis wrote of the responsibility of bosses to be mentors. Now he writes about the importance of finding a mentor who will be a confidante, critic, and cheerleader. A boss may be taken with a young person and claim the mentor role. That is not to be spurned. At the same time, it is difficult to talk to one’s boss about personal insecurity, concerns about the management (his management) of the organization, and one’s ambitions for getting ahead in the pecking order. If the boss is a contemporary, then the hard-charging subordinate may be seen as a threat.

The point is emphasized that as a neophyte advances, he becomes a boss. His possibilities for further advancement may be judged on how well he relates to his own subordinates. Loyalty has to be real and must flow both directions. Dr. Margulis also writes about what to do when the boss is on your case. Is it possible and is it prudent to defend your job against a boss who wants you out of there? How would you go about it?

A hallmark of this book and the first one is that they are quick and easy reads. The points are made clearly and succinctly. Then, or for days or months afterward, a reader will recall key points and find himself fitting them against his own dilemmas or aspirations. This is known in some circles as good teaching. This book can be recommended for anyone who wants to get to the top in academia or business and has not yet done so.
