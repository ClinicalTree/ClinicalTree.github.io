## Rationale and Objectives

Given the significance of coronary artery disease as the most important socioeconomic health care problem in the Western World, the application of computer-aided simple triage (CAST) systems to this disease would be desirable.

## Materials and Methods

In total, 93 patients with acute chest pain and an intermediate risk score for acute coronary syndrome underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA). Among those, 74 were of adequate image quality for automated analysis by a commercially available CAST system (COR Analyzer, RCADIA, Haifa, Israel). CAST findings were compared to human expert interpretation for the detection of significant stenosis (≥50%) in the left main, left anterior descending, circumflex, right coronary artery, or arterial branches. Further, one inexperienced observer evaluated all studies for significant stenoses alone and after 1 month guided by a CAST system as an initial read.

## Results

Human expert interpretation identified 37/74 patients with stenosis ≥50%, whereas the CAST detected 45 patients. The CAST system demonstrated a sensitivity of 100%/79% and a specificity of 78%/89% on a per-patient/per-vessel level, respectively. With CAST, the inexperienced readers' per-vessel sensitivity and positive predictive values significantly improved ( _P_ = .011, _P_ = .009) from 69% and 41% to 91% and 74%, respectively.

## Conclusions

The investigated CAST system for automatic stenosis detection can accurately identify patients with coronary artery stenosis ≥50% and may be of use as initial interpretation and triage of cCTA studies as well as a second reader for inexperienced readers, in absence of expert readers.

Proper assessment of patients who present with undefined chest pain represents a major challenge for emergency department (ED) physicians. For patients with acute chest pain and a low- to intermediate-risk profile for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the current guidelines recommend noninvasive diagnostic testing . Several studies have evaluated coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) for the detection of significant coronary artery stenosis in comparison with coronary catheterization and consistently report high accuracy . Most important for clinical practice is the high negative predictive value (NPV) of this test, indicating that cCTA can reliably exclude significant coronary artery stenosis . However, a major limitation of cCTA for evaluation of chest pain patients in the ED is the lack of available experienced readers, especially during nighttime and weekend hours. Therefore, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system with consistent performance for coronary artery stenosis detection appears desirable. Although there exist a great variety of automated software tools to assist physicians in manual interpretation of cCTA studies , none of them is able to perform a fully automatic evaluation of a study without human reader interaction. Recently a computer-aided simple triage (CAST) system, which is a subclass of CAD, was introduced . Because of a higher diagnostic accuracy, CAST is aimed to provide a fully automatic initial interpretation of a study: a “wet read.” Unlike conventional CAD systems, primarily used as “second readers,” CAST is able to perform initial study triage automatically. Reliable automatic study triage provided by CAST, followed by human verification performed by a trained physician, could safely exclude ACS and, thus, markedly expand the impact of cCTA on management of acute chest pain.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of commercially available CAST system for stenosis detection in cCTA and the effect of such a system on the performance of readers with different experience levels in a consecutive cohort of ED patients with an intermediate risk for ACS.
