This collection of 320 cases is an excellent review for anyone preparing for the radiology oral board examination. Representative images and short clinical histories are provided in an easy-to-use format for quick review. Nearly every case is presented with clinical history, salient imaging findings, differential, diagnosis, and some discussion of the entity and a representative image on the facing page. Additional information and references are also provided for further study.

One of the nice features is that some entities are presented more than once, and therefore varied images are available to enhance the reader’s ability to recognize the salient findings. The cases include common and esoteric entities mixed throughout the text; this feature may seem frustrating, but it is probably a good exercise because it may reflect what happens during an exam or workday. However, there is not a lot of emphasis within the text to reflect which entities are less common.

All modalities are represented within this text. Cases span a diverse gamut of diagnoses within pediatric radiology (musculoskeletal, genitourinary, gastrointestinal, neurologic, cardiovascular, and pulmonary cases are included and grouped by these sections). Purchase of the book enables the reader to access the entire text online.

The images (>900) are of high quality and demonstrate the pathology well. The kinds of images chosen are comparable to what is shown during examinations. For this reason, this text is very useful to anyone preparing for a board examination or anyone preparing a case review session.
