## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that when a radiologist does not perceive an abnormality in images that contain either extremely subtle abnormalities or no abnormalities, the radiologist cannot distinguish these two types of images and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reflects that performance.

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective study was conducted with approval of our institutional review board. Four general radiologists participated in an observer performance study of 100 chest images, each of which had a 5 × 5 cm region of interest (ROI) drawn (50 containing a lung nodule, and 50 did not, based on computed tomography \[CT\] confirmation). About half of the lung nodules were extremely subtle. The readers reported their confidence that a nodule was present within the ROI, from which empirical and maximum-likelihood “proper” binormal and conventional binormal ROC curves were estimated. The readers also reported whether they saw an abnormality that could be a nodule within the ROI.

## Results

Empirical ROC curves deviated from typical ROC-curve shapes, and a portion of the curve leading to the northeast corner of the ROC space had relatively steep and constant slopes. The readers reported not seeing anything suggestive of a lung nodule in this portion of the ROC curve, which also corresponded to cases that either contained extremely subtle nodules or normal cases. The average area under the ROC curves (mean ± standard deviation) was 0.66 ± 0.02 for proper binormal, 0.62 ± 0.02 for conventional binormal, and 0.60 ± 0.03 for trapezoidal ROC curves.

## Conclusions

When a radiologist does not perceive an abnormality in images that contain either extremely subtle abnormalities or no abnormalities, the ROC curve (or a portion thereof) is characterized by a straight line, which is not consistent with conventional ROC theories.

## Introduction

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is a cornerstone for the evaluation of diagnostic performance in binary tasks (e.g., cancer present vs. cancer absent) . A fundamental idea of ROC analysis is that the readers could alter, essentially at will, their decision criterion to call a case positive (e.g., cancer-present), thus altering sensitivity and specificity (i.e., ROC operating point) along the readers' ROC curve . Charles Metz explained in 1978, referring to Bayesian (or ideal observer) decision theory, that: “one can show on theoretical grounds that if the decision maker uses available information in a proper way, the slope of the ROC curve must steadily decrease (i.e., it must become less steep) as one moves up and to the right on the curve” . It is widely accepted that an ROC curve, including that of human observers, must have slopes that decrease monotonically as one moves up and to the right on the curve .

We observed recently that “occult abnormalities” in detection tasks could give rise to human observer empirical ROC curves that deviate from this shape . We defined an occult abnormality as one in an image for which, even in retrospect, when informed of its presence and location in the image, a reader is not able to identify it confidently. In radiology literature, these abnormalities are more commonly known as “extremely subtle”—to the extent that they may be not visible at all in the image  1

. We will thus use the term “extremely subtle” here instead of “occult.” We showed in Jiang that depending on frequencies of extremely subtle abnormalities and apparently normal cases (which can be considered a counterpart of extremely subtle abnormalities because they, too, do not contain visible abnormalities), human observers' ROC curves could have slopes that decrease monotonically (as ROC theory predicts), or remain approximately constant, or even increase—near the northeast corner of the ROC-curve space. In contrast, the ideal observer's ROC curve always has decreasing slopes .
