## Rationale and Objectives

To identify magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics allowing specific preoperative discrimination between colloid cysts (CCs) of the sellar region and third ventricle (CC3rdv) versus Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs).

## Materials and Methods

MR imaging data of 38 patients with histologically proven CCs/CC3rdv and RCC underwent retrospective analysis with respect to signal intensity and heterogeneity on T1- and T2-weighted images, presence of the dot sign, enhancement, size, location, and accompanying infundibular stalk abnormalities.

## Results

Thirteen patients had CCs, 12 had CC3rdv, and 13 had RCCs. Signal intensity on T1-weighted images was partly or entirely hyperintense ( _n_ = 8), iso- or mixed iso/hypointense ( _n_ = 5) in CCs; hyperintense ( _n_ = 8), isointense, or mixed hypo/isointense ( _n_ = 3) in CC3rdv and hyperintense ( _n_ = 9); or mixed ( _n_ = 4) in RCCs. On T2-weighted images, signal intensity was hypointense ( _n_ = 12) or hyperintense ( _n_ = 1) in CCs, hypointense ( _n_ = 9) or hyperintense ( _n_ = 2) in CC3rdv, and hypointense ( _n_ = 5) or iso/hyperintense ( _n_ = 8) in RCCs. T2-weighted images were unavailable in two patients. Only one questionable enhancement was found in CCs, whereas an enhancing rim was consistently seen in RCCs. The dot sign was present in 7 CCs, 8 CC3rdv, and 4 RCCs. Mean cyst diameters were 12.6 mm for CCs and 14.5 mm for RCCs. RCCs showed more frequent and even solely suprasellar extent contrary to CCs.

## Conclusion

Cyst wall enhancement was found in all RCCs but in none of the CCs, making this feature a reliable discriminator between the two. Complementary, suprasellar extension was more frequent in RCCs, whereas signal hypointensity on T2w was more common in colloid cysts.

Colloid cysts (CC) are benign, epithelial-lined mass lesions occurring in different locations, mostly attached to the anterosuperior aspect of the third ventricle between the columns of the fornices. Imaging features of CC of the third ventricle (CC3rdv) have already been reported and, because of their typical location, the spectrum of differential diagnoses is fairly restricted. Their magnetic resonance (MR) signal characteristics are dependent on the composition of the cyst content, in which T1-weighted signal correlates with cholesterol concentration (2/3 of them being hyperintense on nonenhanced T1-weighted images), whereas T2-weighted signal is variable. The latter reflects either water content (mostly isointense to the brain) or small amounts of paramagnetic substances contained in macrophages within CC (usually hypointense to the brain). Moreover, CC contain dense material of variable viscosity (mucoid or desiccated) intermixed with old blood, hemosiderin, cholesterol crystals, and various ions that seriously impact the MR signal. CC show no enhancement, not even in the cyst wall . The lining of CC3rdv is variable with stretches of cuboidal or flattened columnar epithelium that may alter with simple or pseudostratified epithelium.

Contrary to CC3rdv, the spectrum of differentials in case of CC of the sellar region (CCs) is more challenging. CCs are located between the anterior and posterior lobe of the pituitary gland and represent part of the so-called pars intermedia masses. Discrimination from other predominantly or entirely cystic masses such as Rathke's cleft cysts (RCCs), arachnoid cysts, cystic adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, empty sella, pituitary necrosis, or some types of hypophysitis often proves difficult.
