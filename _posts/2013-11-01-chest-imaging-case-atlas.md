The second edition of _Chest Imaging Case Atlas_ is an excellent resource for radiology residents, cardiothoracic imaging fellows, and practicing radiologists. The case-based format, with more than 1500 images covering a wide range of conditions, is also ideal for radiology residents preparing for board examinations. The atlas is comprehensive, yet concise and well-organized with tables, useful illustrations, bulleted differential considerations, and succinct but thorough discussions.

The text is organized into 13 sections. Each section begins with a brief overview that provides background, relevant clinical information, and introduces basic differential considerations. Section one thoroughly covers cardiothoracic anatomy, with multiple well-labeled diagrams and plenty of illustrative radiographs, computed tomography (CT) images as well as some magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The lateral radiograph and the mediastinal lines and stripes, areas of confusion for many junior radiology residents, are particularly well-described with effective cross-sectional correlations. The section dedicated to diffuse lung disease includes an expanded overview dedicated to an approach to high-resolution chest CT (HRCT). The secondary pulmonary lobule and basic pulmonary disease patterns, such as reticular patterns, nodular patterns, and patterns of low and high attenuation are discussed and illustrated through many graphic figures. This discussion also includes multiple well-organized tables that clearly present differential considerations for each of the fundamental HRCT patterns.

The atlas includes more than 200 excellent cases. Cases are presented with a brief patient history, followed by high-quality images. The majority of cases are focused on radiographic and CT findings, although there are a few MRI and angiographic studies, particularly in the Adult Cardiovascular Disease section. Each case is complemented by a concise description of the imaging findings, differential diagnosis, and outstanding discussion that presents high-yield clinical information as well as a short bulleted list of pearls that summarizes the must-knows for each case and the distinguishing features for each entity. Suggested readings are also given for each case.

Collectively, the cases cover a broad scope of thoracic diseases, ranging from relatively common entities, such as patterns of atelectasis and community-acquired pneumonias, to rarer conditions, such as occupational lung disease and interstitial lung disease. Other highlights of this book include a dedicated lung cancer section that describes the TMN staging system, a thoracic trauma section that provides a good discussion of aortic injuries and aortic variants that may mimic injury, as well as a valuable section on postoperative chest imaging, covering imaging findings after a number of procedures, such as lobectomy, pneumonectomy, transplantation, and lung volume reduction surgery. Perhaps the only lacking section is a dedicated chapter to pediatric imaging, although some of the entities described in the developmental anomalies section are pertinent to pediatric radiology.

_Chest Imaging Case Atlas_ is well-suited for radiologists at all levels, including radiologists in residency or fellowship training, general radiologists who interpret chest radiographs or CT in their daily practice, and specialized cardiothoracic imagers who desire a quick reference text to illustrate examples of more rare thoracic pathologies. Purchase of the atlas also includes 12 months of free web access to the thoracic cases in the RadCases online case database, which supplements the cases provided in this atlas. This textbook would be a valuable addition to any thoracic reading room.
