## Rationale and Objectives

When using mammographic detectors of different sizes, it can be difficult to match patient breast size to optimal detector size. We studied whether a mismatch between breast size and optimal detector size resulted in increased radiation exposure.

## Materials and Methods

All screening and diagnostic (Dx) mammography patients during a 6-week period in November–December 2009 (864 patients) were evaluated (institutional review board exemption for quality assurance studies). Data gathered included breast size (large or small), detector size used, number of views obtained, mean glandular dose (MGD) per breast, and patient waiting time. Average MGD and average waiting time was calculated for imaging performed on appropriately matched or mismatched breast size–detector size pairs.

## Results

Screening mammography patients with large breasts imaged on a small detector received a significantly higher radiation dose (4.9 vs. 3.3 mGy, _P_ < .05) and a greater number of views (5.9 vs. 4.6, _P_ < .05) compared to optimally matched breast–detector pairs. Dx mammography patients with large breasts imaged on a small detector received a higher radiation dose (8.2 vs. 6.7 mGy, _P_ < .05) compared to optimally matched breast–detector pairs, although without an increased number of views. Waiting times were longer for a large detector.

## Conclusions

A mismatch in breast–detector sizes results in a significantly greater radiation dose to patients with large breasts imaged on a small detector. Pressure to minimize patient waiting time may inadvertently result in increased radiation dose. Detector size should be matched to breast size whenever possible, but particularly for patients with larger breast sizes.

The goal of mammography is to identify and evaluate breast cancer and breast disease . The reduction in mortality from breast cancer attributable to screening mammography has been shown to outweigh risks related to radiation exposure . However, in accordance with the general practice mandate of minimizing all diagnostic radiation doses to patients and personnel (the As Low As Reasonably Achievable concept), mammography strives to minimize the examination's radiation dose. Conventional two-view screening mammography should result in a mean glandular dose per breast on the order of 3–4 mGy . Appropriate imaging should use equipment that minimizes radiation exposure and provides images of diagnostic quality .

Digital mammography has now been routinely integrated into a number of practices, and detectors exist in four basic designs: phosphor-charge coupled devices (CCD), photostimulable phosphors, flat panel phosphors, and selenium flat panel imagers . Each has its benefits and limitations. CCD, the most common type of detector, provides high spatial resolution; however, because of manufacturing constraints CCD-type mammographic detectors are available only in preset sizes (small and large detectors). When using mammographic detectors of different sizes, it is often difficult to match patient breast size to optimal detector size. Our goal was to determine if increased radiation exposure occurs when there is a mismatch between breast size and optimal detector size. To our knowledge, no prior study has evaluated this question.
