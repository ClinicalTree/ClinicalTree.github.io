## Rationale and Objectives

To systematically review and meta-analyze published data about the diagnostic accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (  18 F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis between malignant and benign pleural lesions.

## Methods and Materials

A comprehensive literature search of studies published through June 2013 regarding the diagnostic performance of  18 F-FDG-PET and PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of pleural lesions was carried out. All retrieved studies were reviewed and qualitatively analyzed. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR−) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of  18 F-FDG-PET or PET/CT in the differential diagnosis of pleural lesions on a per-patient–based analysis were calculated. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to measure the accuracy of these methods. Subanalyses considering device used (PET or PET/CT) were performed.

## Results

Sixteen studies including 745 patients were included in the systematic review. The meta-analysis of 11 selected studies provided the following results: sensitivity 95% (95% confidence interval \[95%CI\]: 92–97%), specificity 82% (95%CI: 76–88%), LR+ 5.3 (95%CI: 2.4–11.8), LR− 0.09 (95%CI: 0.05–0.14), DOR 74 (95%CI: 34–161). The AUC was 0.95. No significant improvement of the diagnostic accuracy considering PET/CT studies only was found.

## Conclusions

18 F-FDG-PET and PET/CT demonstrated to be accurate diagnostic imaging methods in the differential diagnosis between malignant and benign pleural lesions; nevertheless, possible sources of false-negative and false-positive results should be kept in mind.

Malignant pleural lesions are not uncommon. In 90% of the cases, they are secondary and caused by metastatic disease or lymphoma. In only 10% of the cases, pleural malignancy is primary and caused by malignant pleural mesothelioma or, more rarely, by other primary pleural tumors . The correct differential diagnosis between malignant and benign pleural disease is crucial, because the management and the prognosis of these lesions are different .

Imaging methods may play an important role in the differential diagnosis between malignant and benign pleural lesions . Computed tomography (CT) is the first-line diagnostic method in pleural pathologies . However, this method is not always able to differentiate between malignant and benign pleural lesions because of the significant overlap between the radiological appearances of these conditions .
