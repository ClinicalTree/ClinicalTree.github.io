## Rationale and Objectives

Lung and lobar volume measurements from computed tomographic (CT) imaging are being used in clinical trials to assess new minimally invasive emphysema treatments aiming to reduce lung volumes. Establishing the reproducibility of lung volume measurements is important if they are to be accepted as treatment planning and outcome variables. The aims of this study were to (1) investigate the correlation between lung volumes assessed on CT imaging and on pulmonary function testing (PFT), (2) compare the two methods' reproducibility, and (3) assess the reproducibility of CT lobar volumes.

## Materials and Methods

CT imaging and body plethysmography were performed at baseline and after a 9-month interval in multicenter emphysema treatment trials. Lung volumes were measured at total lung capacity (TLC) and at residual volume (RV). Lobar volumes were measured on CT imaging using a semiautomated technique. The correlations between CT and PFT volumes were computed for 486 subjects at baseline. Reproducibility was assessed in terms of the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for 126 subjects from the control group at TLC and 120 subjects at RV.

## Results

Correlations between CT and PFT lung volumes were 0.86 at TLC and 0.67 at RV. At TLC, the ICCs were 0.943 for CT imaging and 0.814 for PFT. At RV, the ICCs were 0.886 for CT imaging and 0.683 for PFT. CT lobar volumes showed good reproducibility (all _P_ values < .05).

## Conclusion

CT lung and lobar volume measurements could be captured in a multicenter trial setting with high reproducibility and were highly correlated with those obtained on PFT. CT imaging showed significantly better reproducibility than PFT between interval lung volume measurements, offering the potential for designing emphysema treatment trials involving fewer subjects.

Lung volume and density measurements from computed tomographic (CT) imaging play a prominent role in the diagnosis of emphysema . Traditionally, forced expiratory volume in 1 second has been used to measure the progression of emphysema, but destructive changes in lung parenchyma often precede decreases in forced expiratory volume by several years . The quantitative assessment of the lungs using CT imaging provides important complementary information to the results of pulmonary function testing (PFT) because it allows the assessment of single and lobar lung volumes . This ability for the regional measurement of volumes is important in volume reduction treatments for emphysema .

CT lung volumes are playing a key role in clinical trials of new minimally invasive therapies aimed at the reduction of lung volume . These treatments involve placing a one-way valve in the lobar or segmental airway to prevent air from entering these portions of the lung while still allowing air to exit. Reduction in the volume of the treated lobe measured using CT imaging is used to assess atelectasis resulting from the treatment. Therefore, establishing the reproducibility of lung volume measurements is important if they are to be accepted as treatment planning and outcome variables in these trials. In this paper, we report on the reproducibility of CT lung and lobar volume measurements in two parallel multicenter clinical trials. We compared the reproducibility of CT lung volumes against those from PFT.
