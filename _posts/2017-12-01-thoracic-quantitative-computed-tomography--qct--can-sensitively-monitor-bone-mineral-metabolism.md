## Rationale and Objective

Sensitive detection of bone mineral density (BMD) change is a key issue to monitor and evaluate the individual bone health status, as well as bone metabolism and bone mineral status. The ability to use thoracic quantitative computed tomography (QCT) to detect the annual change of BMD remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the sensitivity in detecting age-related bone mineral loss using the thoracic QCT from the electrocardiographically gated heart scans in comparison to whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and standard lumbar QCT.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 121 asymptomatic patients' imaging data, including DXA whole body scan, cardiac CT scan, and abdomen scans were analyzed. The BMD of the thoracolumbar spine, upper, and lower extremities were measured using QCT and DXA, respectively. The age-related annual rate of bone density loss was computed and compared to the thoracic and lumbar QCT, as well DXA measures.

## Results

The age-related annual rate of bone loss with QCT was −0.70 mg/mL  3 (−0.75%/y) in women, −0.83 mg/mL  3 (−0.86%/y) in men in the thoracic and the lumbar trabecular QCT, respectively. Compared to the QCT, DXA demonstrates a lower annual rate of bone loss in the area of BMD measurement ( _P_ < .05 in all, excluding legs of women) in −0.45, −0.42, −0.67, and −0.46 in women, in −0.32, −0.02, −0.12, and −0.08 in men for thoracic, lumbar, leg, and arm, respectively.

## Conclusion

We conclude that the thoracic and the lumbar QCT provide a similar and more sensitive method for detecting bone mineral loss when compared to DXA.

## Introduction

Bone fracture and cardiovascular disease are two of the most common diseases and strongly associated with high morbidity and mortality. Osteoporosis and coronary atherosclerosis are crucial independent risk factors for bone fracture and cardiovascular disease, respectively , and both can be detected by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) using a low-dose cardiac CT-produced image . Given that the importance of using QCT to assess bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine may be a potentially diagnostic tool for osteoporosis-related vertebral fractures, several initial studies have indicated that the lumbar QCT is robust for the detection of osteoporosis, and BMD change can be more sensitively detected with serial scans . As a matter of fact, some preliminary thoracic QCT data from a routine lung or heart scan have indicated its compatibility with the lumbar QCT even if the sensitivity to detect the annual loss rate of BMD with the thoracic QCT remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ability to detect the age-related annual rate of bone loss by the thoracic QCT with an electrocardiographically gated routine heart scan in comparison to whole-body double-energy densitometry (DXA) and lumbar QCT.

## Subject and Methods

## Study Population

This chart review retrospective study comprises a total of 121 (56, 20–81 years) asymptomatic patients who underwent DXA whole-body and CT heart and abdomen scans on the same day. The aims of the study were the quantification of coronary calcified burden and examination of body composition, including bone mineral content (BMC), BMD, and percentage of the body fat and fat-free mass. The exclusion criteria are patients with metal implement in the thoracolumbar spine (only one case). All patients had optimal CT and DXA images with no significant noise or metal artifact.

![Figure 1, QCT BMD measurement. (a) (Panel 1) and (b) (Panel 2) are axial and sagittal chest images with a four-rods calibration phantom (bottom of the panel 1, white circles ). The three consecutive thoracic trabecular tracing was performed from the slice level of left main coronary artery caudally ( white arrow on panel 1, or black line and arrow on panel 2) from a CT heart scan of a 60-year-old man. After selection of a spine level, the segmentation of phantom rods and trabeculae were completed automatically by computer. The calibrated thoracic BMD (mg/cm 3 ) can be displayed automatically. The Q5000 system was used in this measurement.
