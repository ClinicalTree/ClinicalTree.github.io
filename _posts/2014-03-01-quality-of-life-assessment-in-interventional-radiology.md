The aim of this review was to describe quality of life (QoL) questionnaires relevant to interventional radiology.

Interventional radiologists perform a large number of palliative procedures. The effect of these therapies on QoL is important. This is particularly true for cancer therapies where procedures with marginal survival benefits may result in tremendous QoL benefits. Image-guided minimally invasive procedures should be compared to invasive procedures, with respect to QoL, as part of comparative effectiveness assessment. A large number of questionnaires have been validated for measurement of overall and disease-specific quality of life.

Use of applicable QoL assessments can aid in evaluating clinical outcomes and help to further substantiate the need for minimally invasive image-guided procedures.

Many therapies affect quality of life (QoL) and survival. QoL measurements have become increasingly important end points in patient care and clinical trials. These measurements may be more relevant to patient well-being compared to traditional disease-specific end points, such as laboratory or imaging-based end points particularly when procedures are being performed for symptomatic relief. For example, catheter-directed and percutaneous ablative cancer therapies may result in marginal survival benefits but tremendous improvements in QoL. QoL metrics are now commonplace in cancer therapeutic clinical trials. Interventional radiologists can easily incorporate QoL assessments into periprocedural clinical care. QoL assessments may also aid in procedural selection. For example, Salem et al. recently used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep) (  http://www.facit.org ) survey as well as their embolotherapy-specific score to compare QoL in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) undergoing transarterial chemo embolization (TACE) versus radioembolization. They found that patients undergoing radioembolization had improved QoL whereas TACE treatment was associated with worsening of QoL.

Because of the relative paucity of literature regarding QoL measurements in interventional radiology, it can be difficult to determine the suitable QoL measurement tool. The purpose of this article is to describe commonly used QoL tools that the interventional radiologist may incorporate into clinical care and comparative effectiveness assessment.

## Methods

A systematic literature review of general and disease-specific QoL assessment questionnaires, relevant to interventional radiology, was conducted to identify those most frequently used. MEDLINE (National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine 8600 Rockville Pike, Bethesda MD, 20894 USA) was used to identify a comprehensive group of relevant articles. All articles that addressed interventional radiology and QoL were included. The reference lists of included articles were also assessed for additional publications. The most commonly used, previously validated, QOL surveys were included.
