## Rationale and Objectives

We have conducted a fractal analysis of low-dose digital chest phantom radiographs and evaluated the relationship between the fractal-feature distance and the tube current-exposure time product.

## Materials and Methods

Chest phantom radiographs were obtained at various mAs values (0.5–4.0 mAs) and 140 kVp with a computed radiography system, and the reference images were acquired at 13 mAs. The lung field images were converted to binary images after processing them using the rolling-ball technique; a fractal analysis was conducted using the box-counting method for these binary images. The fractal-feature distances between the low-dose and reference images were calculated using the fractal dimension and the complexity.

## Results

For all binary images of lung fields, the relationship between the length of the square boxes and the number of boxes needed to cover the positive pixels of the binary image was linear on a log-log scale ( _r_ ≥ 0.99). For mAs ≥ 3.0, the fractal-feature distances were almost constant, whereas for mAs ≤ 2.5, they increased depending on the reduction in mAs values.

## Conclusion

We have shown that a binary image of the lung field obtained from a chest phantom radiograph can be analyzed by the box-counting method and that its fractal-feature distance grows as the radiation dose declines.

Since digital technology has been introduced into medical images, a variety of digital imaging modalities have been developed. Types of digital radiography such as computed radiography (CR) and flat-panel digital radiography provide a wide-exposure latitude and high-contrast resolution compared with conventional screen-film radiography; moreover, their contrast, exposure latitude, and optical density can be controlled over a wide range of radiation exposure doses. These systems still have the potential to allow even further reductions in radiation dosage for patients; a dose-reduction level that provides a satisfactory diagnostic image has been investigated intensively ( ).

In general, evaluations of medical-image quality are performed based on measurements of physical indices such as signal-to-noise ratio ( ) and detective quantum efficiency ( ) and are confirmed by observer performance studies such as receiver operating characteristics (ROC) ( ) and contrast-detail (C-D) analysis ( ). However, because human observer studies are so time consuming to perform, many have attempted to determine the physical indices that would be equivalent to the observer performance index \[such as area under the ROC curve in ROC analysis ( ) and image quality figure in C-D analysis ( )\] or to produce a model observer that emulates human performance ( ). However, the results of these attempts have proved controversial.

The fractal-feature distance will show the similarity of image textures between the considered and reference images from a fractal analysis viewpoint, and the longer the fractal-feature distance, the greater is the difference between these two image textures. Given that all images were acquired from the same chest phantom, the difference in the fractal-feature distance must have originated from image degradation mainly due to a reduction in the exposure dose.
