The _Gastrointestinal Imaging: Case Review Series_ , third edition, is a solid review text that will be most useful for radiology residents and those studying for board exams. The book contains 200 cases, organized in terms of increasing difficulty as 60 “opening round” cases, 90 “fair game” cases, and 50 “challenge” cases. This provides a nice mixture of cases, with more basic diagnoses and classic imaging appearances early and less common diseases or atypical imaging features as the book progresses. Each case contains one or more images with a short clinical history and four multiple choice questions. The following page has answers to the multiple choice questions, as well as a short summary of the case addressing teaching points. There are also a couple of references provided for each case and a cross-reference with the appropriate page in Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites.

The format of the book is one of its strengths, in my opinion, particularly if used as a review book or in preparation for board exams. It is a quick read, allowing the reader to see a large number of cases in a short amount of time. Each case lets the reader create a differential diagnosis, while also simulating an examination by forcing the reader to think critically about the case through the use of multiple choice questions. This format does limit the text's intended audience, as the summaries at the end of the cases are kept brief and usually do not provide a very thorough discussion. However, if further reading is desired the cross-reference that is provided with the Requisites can be helpful.

With 200 cases, the book covers a decent amount of the breadth of gastrointestinal radiology. The focus is on fluoroscopy and computed tomography, with a few scattered cases involving ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging is generally of good quality, with one to four images provided per case, which are usually well-selected examples of the disease in question. More images would certainly improve the learning value of the book. In particular, there is quite a bit of blank space on the summary pages for many cases, and adding more images to see more examples of the same diagnosis would have been useful. The summaries can also be inconsistent in the information they provide. A more systematic approach listing best imaging modality, imaging findings, pertinent clinical information, and any necessary next steps would have been a nice addition.

In summary, this is a useful review book for radiology residents and those studying for board exams. The format is very conducive to board preparation, and it is a nice way to see a variety of gastrointestinal imaging cases quickly, with a focus on computed tomography and fluoroscopy.
