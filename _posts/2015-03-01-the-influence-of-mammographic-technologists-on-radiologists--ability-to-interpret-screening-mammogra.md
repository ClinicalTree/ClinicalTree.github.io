## Rationale and Objectives

To determine whether the mammographic technologist has an effect on the radiologists' interpretative performance of screening mammography in community practice.

## Materials and Methods

In this institutional review board–approved retrospective cohort study, we included Carolina Mammography Registry data from 372 radiologists and 356 mammographic technologists from 1994 to 2009 who performed 1,003,276 screening mammograms. Measures of interpretative performance (recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value \[PPV  1 \], and cancer detection rate \[CDR\]) were ascertained prospectively with cancer outcomes collected from the state cancer registry and pathology reports. To determine if the mammographic technologist influenced the radiologists' performance, we used mixed effects logistic regression models, including a radiologist-specific random effect and taking into account the clustering of examinations across women, separately for screen-film mammography (SFM) and full-field digital mammography (FFDM).

## Results

Of the 356 mammographic technologists included, 343 performed 889,347 SFM examinations, 51 performed 113,929 FFDM examinations, and 38 performed both SFM and FFDM examinations. A total of 4328 cancers were reported for SFM and 564 cancers for FFDM. The technologists had a statistically significant effect on the radiologists' recall rate, sensitivity, specificity, and CDR for both SFM and FFDM ( _P_ values <.01). For PPV  1 , variability by technologist was observed for SFM ( _P_ value <.0001) but not for FFDM ( _P_ value = .088).

## Conclusions

The interpretative performance of radiologists in screening mammography varies substantially by the technologist performing the examination. Additional studies should aim to identify technologist characteristics that may explain this variation.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, excluding cancers of the skin and is expected to account for an estimated 232,670 cases and 40,000 deaths in the United States in 2014 . Routine screening mammography is the primary means of early breast cancer detection with radiologic technologists fulfilling an essential role in the mammography process. Although routine screening mammography has been shown to be effective in reducing breast cancer mortality , many factors lead to variability in interpretative performance by radiologists .

Several studies have found radiologists' gender, work patterns, postresidency training, years of experience, specialization, and screening versus diagnostic mix influence mammography performance measures . It is also likely that the radiologists' ability to interpret mammograms is affected by technologists who work with the radiologists. Possible sources of variation in radiologists' interpretative ability may include the interface between the radiologist and technologist and the ability of the radiologic technologist to obtain a high-quality image in terms of positioning, compression, and sharpness.
