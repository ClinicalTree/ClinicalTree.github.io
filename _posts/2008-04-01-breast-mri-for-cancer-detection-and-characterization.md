## Rationale and Objectives

Breast MRI is an important new tool in the imaging armamentarium for the detection and characterization of breast carcinoma. Understanding the evidence-supported benefits and potential harms of breast MRI is important to ensure the appropriate utilization of this medical resource.

## Materials and Methods

This article reviews the clinical settings in which MRI for breast cancer assessment has been shown to be advantageous. The evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of MRI and the impact of this imaging tool on clinical outcomes are described. Novel breast MRI techniques which may lead to future improvements in performance are discussed.

## Results

Breast MRI has been shown in multiple studies to be advantageous for screening patients at high risk, evaluating patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis, monitoring treatment response in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and evaluating patients with metastatic axillary adenocarcinoma and unknown primary site. Among the limitations of MRI are its high cost and modest specificity resulting in false positive examinations.

## Conclusions

When used in evidence-supported clinical settings, the high sensitivity of MRI results in earlier cancer detection or greater accuracy of detection compared to existing tests for breast carcinoma. Further scientific endeavors are crucial to optimize the future performance and application of breast MRI.

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important new tool in the imaging armamentarium for the detection and characterization of breast carcinoma. In 2003, the first edition of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) MRI lexicon was published ( ), reflecting the significance of this imaging technique. Because of the enthusiasm for its benefits, there has been a rapid increase in the use of breast MRI over the last several years. Importantly, scientific evidence supports the use of breast MRI for specific clinical applications, although data are lacking to support MRI use for other clinical scenarios. An understanding of the current literature regarding breast MRI for cancer evaluation is necessary for evidence-based employment of this imaging tool. Use that is guided by prior studies of efficacy will optimize the clinical value of breast MRI and facilitate the appropriate utilization of this medical resource.

In this article, we first describe the clinical settings in which MRI for cancer assessment has been shown to be advantageous: screening patients at high risk, evaluating patients with a new breast cancer diagnosis, monitoring treatment response in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and evaluating patients with metastatic axillary adenocarcinoma and unknown primary site. For each clinical setting, the evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy of breast MRI is reviewed. Where study results exist for MRI efficacy based on effects on patient management or clinical outcomes, these findings are also presented. We then describe the clinical scenarios for which breast MRI is not currently well-supported by the literature. Finally, we discuss novel breast MRI techniques that may lead to future improvements in the performance of this imaging tool.
