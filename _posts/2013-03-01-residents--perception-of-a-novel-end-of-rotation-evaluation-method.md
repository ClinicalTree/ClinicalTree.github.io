## Rationale and Objectives

With the advent of the new core and certifying examinations, a need has arisen to restructure learning and assessment to better reflect the emphasis on continuous learning throughout residency. We developed a multiparametric end-of-rotation (EOR) evaluation tool to assess medical knowledge, oral presentation, and written communication skills administered to the residents at the end of each core subspecialty rotation. The benefit of continual assessment is obvious from a program perspective; the purpose of this article is to evaluate the residents' perception of the process.

## Materials and Methods

All residents ( _n_ = 31, 28 postgraduate years two through five and 3 postgraduate year one) participate in the mandatory EOR evaluation as a required component of the residency program. After receiving Institutional Review Board approval, informed consent was obtained from the residents wishing to participate in quarterly 16-question online surveys assessing their experience. Each survey consists of 15 questions with Likert scale responses (1 through 5 from strongly disagree to strongly agree) and one free text answer. Data are collected quarterly, starting in September 2011.

## Results

Overall, the residents' response has been positive. The new evaluation method is felt to be more meaningful than (average 3.9, standard deviation 0.9) and is favored by the residents over the traditional competency-based evaluation (average 4.0, standard deviation 1.0). However, residents retain neutral attitudes regarding preparation for boards or changes in study habits (average score 3.6, standard deviation 0.9 and 3.6, and standard deviation 1.1, respectively).

## Conclusion

Residents rate the EOR evaluation experience positively, although they do not report changes in study habits or increased preparedness for the new certifying examination.

Evaluation and assessment serve as the starting point for curriculum development. The advent of the new American Board of Radiology core and certifying examinations and subsequent Association of Program Directors in Radiology Residency Restructuring Committee recommendations regarding development of a 36-month core curriculum followed by a subspecialty focused year have provided a unique opportunity for development of a new assessment tool. With this in mind, our group created a novel end-of-rotation (EOR) assessment method to evaluate this new educational paradigm.

Computer-based assessment of resident knowledge is long standing and has been shown to improve resident performance . The challenge has been to develop a method that accurately assesses residents, not only from a medical knowledge perspective but also in terms of becoming an independently functioning radiologist well versed in the competencies. Structured assessments do provide data, but are often not concurrent with faculty perception of resident ranking . The shortcomings of multiple-choice testing in assessing knowledge and competence are long standing and although open-ended questions certainly increase accuracy, it does not capture the elements of clinical practice. There is a wealth of literature from emergency medicine documenting assessment techniques for the general competencies and communication . However, to our knowledge, there has not been an evaluation tool in radiology such as ours, which is unique in its scope.

Survey Questions


The end-of-rotation assessment is a fair assessment of learning. I understand the evaluation process used in the end-of-rotation assessment. Feedback helped me better prepare for future rotations. The current end-of-rotation assessment is an improvement over the previous evaluation method (core competency) based. The end-of-rotation feedback is more meaningful than the previous evaluation method. The end-of-rotation assessment provides a better understanding of expectations. Assessment should be performed at the end of the rotation. Assessment should be performed at the midpoint of the rotation. The expectations were appropriate for my level. Performing the sample dictation and receiving written feedback is a valuable exercise. The oral examination is helpful in practicing oral communication skills. The computer-based examination is an appropriate reflection of what I should be expected to know. I feel more prepared for the board examinations because of this testing. Incorporation of end-of-rotation testing has caused me to be more diligent in studying consistently during my rotations.
