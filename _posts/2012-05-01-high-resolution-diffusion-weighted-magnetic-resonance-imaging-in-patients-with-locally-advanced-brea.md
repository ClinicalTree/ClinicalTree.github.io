## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in tumor depiction and measured tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with the use of a high-resolution diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequence, compared to a standard DW MRI sequence, in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

Patients with locally advanced breast cancer were scanned with a reduced–field of view (rFOV) DW MRI sequence (high resolution) and a standard–field of view diffusion sequence (standard resolution), and differences between the two sequences were evaluated quantitatively (by calculating tumor ADC distribution parameters) and qualitatively (by radiologists’ visual assessments of images).

## Results

Although the mean tumor ADC for both sequences was similar, differences were found in other parameters, including the 12.5th percentile ( _P_ = .042) and minimum tumor ADC ( _P_ = .003). Qualitatively, visualization of tumor morphologic detail, heterogeneity, and conspicuity was improved with rFOV DW MRI, and image quality was higher.

## Conclusions

Differences in ADC distribution parameters and qualitative image features suggest that the sequences differ in their ability to capture tumor heterogeneity. These differences are not apparent when the mean is used to evaluate tumor ADC. In particular, differences found in lower ADC values are compatible with reduced partial voluming in rFOV DW MRI, suggesting that rFOV DW MRI may be valuable in imaging the lower ADCs expected to correspond to viable tumor in most invasive breast cancers.

Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a noninvasive, noncontrast, three-dimensional method to measure the random motion of water molecules, quantified as the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in vivo. DW MRI is a promising tool for characterizing microstructural properties of breast lesions, with applications to both diagnostic and prognostic studies. Decreased ADC has been reported in malignant tumors relative to normal breast tissue . In patients with locally advanced breast cancer, DW MRI has been shown to have value in predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy .

Despite this promise, DW MRI of the breast has yet to be fully integrated into clinical practice. Some prognostic studies have found little value in breast DW MRI in monitoring treatment response . Tumor response to treatment is likely to be heterogeneous, and high spatial resolution could improve the ability to capture heterogeneity in diffusivity. High-resolution DW MRI could improve prognostic and diagnostic applications in the breast, but obtaining higher resolution is technically challenging with current commercially available sequences. Most commercially available DW MRI sequences are echo-planar imaging (EPI) based, and spatial resolution is limited by the imaging field of view (FOV) and the number of phase and frequency encoding steps that can be acquired before the signal decays. Acquired in-plane resolution in DW MRI of the breast is generally 2 mm or worse. EPI sequences are also prone to distortion. In breast EPI, distortion and other artifacts are a particular problem, because of changes in magnetic susceptibility at the air-tissue interfaces at the anterior and lateral borders of both breasts, as well as in the adjacent lung.
