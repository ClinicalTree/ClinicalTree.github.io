## Rationale and Objectives

Distinguishing recurrent glial tumor from radiation necrosis can be challenging. The purpose of this pilot study was to preliminarily compare unenhanced arterial spin-labeled (ASL) imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume (DSCE-CBV) magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging in distinguishing predominant glioma recurrence or progression from predominant radiation necrosis in postoperative patients treated with proton-beam therapy.

## Methods

Patients with grade II to IV glioma previously treated with surgery and proton-beam therapy were enrolled on the basis of new enhancing nodules or masses with primary differential diagnoses of predominant tumor recurrence or progression versus radiation necrosis. ASL, DSCE-CBV, and PET examinations were assessed by visual qualitative and quantitative analysis for the detection of predominant tumor recurrence. Imaging results were correlated with a clinical-pathologic reference standard.

## Results

Thirty patients were studied, resulting in 33 ASL, 32 DSCE-CBV, and 26 PET examinations. On the basis of visual inspection, the sensitivities of PET, ASL, and DSCE-CBV examinations for detecting high-grade tumor foci were 81%, 88%, and 86%, respectively. The highest sensitivity values for quantitative ASL imaging were obtained using a normalized cutoff ratio of 1.3, resulting in sensitivity of 94% for ASL imaging and 71% for DSCE-CBV imaging. When predominant high-grade tumors with superimposed regions of predominant mixed radiation necrosis were excluded, DSCE-CBV sensitivity improved to 90%, but ASL sensitivity remained unchanged.

## Conclusions

Compared with DSCE-CBV imaging, ASL imaging may more accurately distinguish predominant recurrent high-grade glioma from radiation necrosis, especially in regions with mixed radiation necrosis, for which DSCE-CBV imaging may underestimate true blood volume because of leakage artifacts.

Primary central nervous system neoplasia is one of the most frequent causes of death between 15 and 35 years of age . Gliomas constitute >90% of primary brain tumors diagnosed after the second decade of life . Despite treatment with chemotherapy and radiation, including proton-beam therapy (PBT) and other radiosurgery, the majority of these tumors progress and/or recur. Moreover, treatment with radiation remains associated with tissue necrosis that may also lead to clinical deterioration . When a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain shows a new enhancing lesion after a patient has undergone surgery and radiation for high-grade glioma, the differentiation of predominant recurrent tumor (or progression of tumor) from predominant radiation necrosis is often crucial, because the two entities have different treatment approaches and prognoses .

Computed tomographic and conventional MRI findings are relatively nonspecific, although some findings on MRI, especially when presenting in combination, may favor a given diagnosis . Positron emission tomographic (PET) and single photon-emission computed tomographic imaging provide additional information regarding tumor metabolism . Although early results with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging were encouraging, some studies have reported specificities as low as 18%, high cost, and limited availability . Glioma recurrence or progression and radiation necrosis may be frequently mixed (in terms of pathology), and residual microscopic tumor foci are often present, even in so-called pure necrosis cases, further complicating the situation .

ASL, arterial spin-labeled; DSCE-CBV, dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume; PET, positron emission tomographic.


The findings are based on grading scores on three-point scale for ASL, DSCE-CBV, and PET imaging in patients treated with proton-beam therapy (Friedman's test, _P_ < .01 for all three comparisons). Consensus rating scores of 0 and 1 indicated nonrecurrence, whereas a score of 2 indicated high-grade recurrence.

Positron emission tomographic imaging (not shown) shows hypometabolism at the site of the abnormally enhancing left parieto-occipital lesion on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial image ( a ). Whereas the arterial spin-labeled (ASL) image ( b ) shows hypoperfusion, the dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced cerebral blood volume (DSCE-CBV) image ( c ) shows hyperperfusion of the enhancing lesion that is surrounded with hypoperfused region due to vasogenic edema. Histopathology of this lesion confirmed radiation necrosis. This case therefore demonstrates “true-negative” ASL and “false-positive” DSCE-CBV findings.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/GliomaRecurrenceVersusRadiationNecrosis/3_1s20S1076633209005960.jpg)
