## Rationale and Objectives

Efficiency is central to current radiology practice. Knowledge of report generation timing is essential for workload optimization and departmental staffing decisions. Yet little research evaluates the distribution of activities performed by neuroradiologists in daily work.

## Materials and Methods

This observational study tracked radiologists interpreting 358 brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an academic practice over 9 months. We measured the total duration from study opening to report signing and times for five activities performed during this period: image viewing, report transcription, obtaining clinical data, education, and other. Attendings, fellows, and residents reading studies independently and attendings over-reading trainee-previewed studies were observed.

## Results

Ten attendings, 12 fellows, and 13 residents spent a mean of 11, 18, and 16 minutes reading brain MRIs independently. Mean duration was significantly different comparing attendings in all assignments to fellows (18.36 ± 1.05 minutes, _p_ = 0.0001) or residents (16.31 ± 1.11 minutes, _p_ = 0.001) but not between fellows/residents. Mean duration among attendings reading independently versus over-reading trainees was not statistically different. Attendings spent the same time on image viewing (4.07–5.33 minutes) with or without trainees. Attending transcription time was shortest when over-reading trainees (2.24 minutes) and longest when reading independently (4.20 minutes), demonstrating benefit of the draft report. Fellows and Residents spent longer on image viewing (7.14 minutes and 8.06 minutes, respectively) and transcription (7.02 minutes and 5.40 minutes, respectively) than attendings reading independently.

## Conclusion

Neuroradiologist time/activity distributions for reading brain MRI studies were measured, setting the stage to establish a benchmark for future reference and suggesting opportunities for greater efficiency. Furthermore, report production time can be decreased when a draft report is available.

## INTRODUCTION

There is constant pressure on radiologists’ productivity, with declining reimbursements for imaging in the United States and increasing demands for faster reporting times. For those practicing in an academic setting, educational commitments confound clinical productivity. Fortunately, these factors have been accompanied by technological advances to enhance productivity. Transition from film-based interpretation to picture archiving and communication system (PACS) allowed more rapid presentation and evaluation of images ( ). Adoption of voice recognition transcription and digital report transmission allows shorter reporting time ( ). Adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) now provides new access to a wealth of clinical and laboratory history in real time. In short, what used to take several days from scan acquisition to the final report now can be completed in minutes to hours.

Although image interpretation remains the most fundamental activity of the radiologist, few studies have evaluated details of this process. Some studies have documented complete report turnaround time ( ), but have limitations and leave open questions. Reporting times for individual studies were estimated instead of directly measured and specific activities performed as part of generation of each report were not assessed. Further, in current academic practice there are several types of clinical assignments, ranging from teaching services with house staff to review of overnight studies, to shifts of independent reading akin to the private practitioner, each with different reporting demands. Lastly, direct comparison of reporting activities between attendings and trainees has not previously been reported.
