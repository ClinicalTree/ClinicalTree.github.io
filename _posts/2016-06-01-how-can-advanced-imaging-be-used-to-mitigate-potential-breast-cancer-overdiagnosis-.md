Radiologists, as administrators and interpreters of screening mammography, are considered by some to be major contributors to the potential harms of screening, including overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this article, we outline current efforts within the breast imaging community toward mitigating screening harms, including the widespread adoption of tomosynthesis and potentially adjusting screening frequency and thresholds for image-guided breast biopsy. However, the emerging field of breast radiomics may offer the greatest promise for reducing overdiagnosis by identifying imaging-based biomarkers strongly associated with tumor biology, and therefore helping prevent the harms of unnecessary treatment for indolent cancers.

## Introduction

The recently revised breast cancer screening recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) have renewed the controversy around the potential benefits and harms of mammography among advocates and detractors of breast cancer screening . Although all authorities reiterate the mortality benefits of routine screening for the general population, they also now consider overdiagnosis and overtreatment among the potential harms of mammography. By definition, overdiagnosis is screen-detected cancer that would not have become clinically apparent during a patient's lifetime . Although it is now fairly widely accepted in the medical community as a legitimate potential risk of screening, it is important to note that overdiagnosis is an event that cannot be directly observed.

Accordingly, precise measurement of overdiagnosis is a challenge that requires understanding not only the effects of screening but also knowledge of alternative causes of death among women prior to development of breast cancer symptoms . There is no consensus on the appropriate methods for estimating overdiagnosis in breast cancer. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the medical literature on the harms of mammography screening that accompanied the 2016 USPSTF recommendations found that methodologies used in overdiagnosis studies are highly variable, with approaches adjusting for lead time falling in the lower range of estimates . Regardless of the true magnitude, both the USPSTF and ACS now acknowledge overdiagnosis from mammography screening and the eventual downstream diagnostic and treatment cascades that follow the detection of indolent cancers as potential harms that should be communicated to patients during shared decision-making .

Although some have previously pointed to the breast imaging community as a major contributor to the problem of overdiagnosis , detection of a malignancy at screening would have limited impact on a patient's health without subsequent intervention and treatment, sometimes referred to as overtreatment. Nevertheless, abnormal screening does launch a series of events as part of an integrated care pathway, where multiple disciplines contribute to diagnosis and treatment planning. After identifying abnormalities at screening and image-guided biopsy, pathologists assist in diagnosing breast malignancy. After the diagnosis of malignancy is made, including ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), treatment decisions are determined by a group of subspecialists, including surgeons, oncologists, and radiation oncologists.

As first-line physicians in a cascade of medical care that is well intentioned, many breast imagers aim to balance the known benefits with the potential harms when making a decision to recall patients from screening. The most effective approach by which breast imagers can mitigate overdiagnosis is, perhaps, the most exciting aspect of this controversial issue. Eliminating screening mammography is not a realistic or ethical option as it would lead to later stage breast cancer diagnoses and increased mortality, even in this era of improved therapies .

As members of multidisciplinary breast care teams with imaging expertise, it is imperative that radiologists engage in this issue by examining how current or emerging advanced breast imaging technologies can lessen the potential harms of overdiagnosis. In this article, we highlight recent advances and areas that warrant further investigation, with the hopes that breast imagers will take an active and leading role in a collaborative effort to decrease breast cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
