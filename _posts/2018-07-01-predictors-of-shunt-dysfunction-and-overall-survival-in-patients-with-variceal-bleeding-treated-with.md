## Rationale and Objectives

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established method for portal hypertension. This study was to investigate the long-term safety, technical success, and patency of TIPS, and to determine the risk factors and clinical impacts of shunt dysfunction.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 154 consecutive patients undergoing embolotherapy of gastric coronary vein and/or short gastric vein and TIPS creation were prospectively studied. Follow-up data included technical success, patency and revision of TIPS, and overall survival of patients.

## Results

During the study, the primary and secondary technical success rates were 98.7% and 100%, respectively. Sixty-three patients developed shunt dysfunction, 30 with shunt stenosis and 33 with shunt occlusion. The cumulative 60-month primary, primary assisted, and secondary patency rates were 19.6%, 43.0%, and 93.4%, respectively. The cumulative 60-month overall survival rates were similar between the TIPS dysfunction group and the TIPS non-dysfunction group (68.6% _vs._ 58.6%, _P_ = .096). Baseline portal vein thrombosis ( _P_ < .001), use of bare stents ( _P_ = .018), and portal pressure gradient (PPG) ( _P_ = .020) were independent predictors for shunt dysfunction, hepatocellular carcinoma ( _P_ < .001), and ascites ( _P_ = .003) for overall survival. The accuracy of PPG for shunt dysfunction was statistically significant ( _P_ < .001), and a cutoff value of 8.5 had 77.8% sensitivity and 64.8% specificity.

## Conclusions

The long-term safety, technical success, and patency of TIPS were good; baseline portal vein thrombosis, use of bare stents, and PPG were significantly associated with shunt dysfunction; shunt dysfunction has little impact on patients' long-term survival because of high secondary patency rates.

## Introduction

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established method to manage sequelae of portal hypertension, that is, variceal hemorrhage and refractory ascites . Initially, TIPS was created by using bare metal stents that led to high rates of shunt dysfunction, often above 50% at 1 year . Shunt dysfunction is associated with recurrence of ascites and variceal hemorrhage , which requires sometimes repeated revisions that bear additional procedural risks and expenses . After the advent of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent grafts, numerous studies have demonstrated that ePTFE-covered stent grafts are better than bare metal stents in long-term patency .

However, shunt dysfunction remains a major concern of TIPS creation with ePTFE-covered stent grafts in the long run. Weber et al. reported that shunt patency rates gradually decreased, mortality rates continued to increase, and the chance of recurrent ascites or bleeding remained present beyond 2 years after TIPS creation with ePTFE-covered stent grafts. Except the type of stent used, there are limited data regarding the risk factors for shunt dysfunction and its impact on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent TIPS creation to prevent variceal rebleeding with ePTFE-covered stent grafts .
