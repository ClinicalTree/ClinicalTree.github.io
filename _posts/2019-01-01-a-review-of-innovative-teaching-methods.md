Teaching is one of the important roles of an academic radiologist. Therefore, it is important that radiologists are taught how to effectively educate and, in turn, to act as role models of these skills to trainees. This is reinforced by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education which has the requirement that all residents who interact with and teach medical students must undergo training in effective methods of teaching. Radiologists are likely familiar with the traditional didactic lecture-type teaching format. However, there are many newer innovative teaching methods that could be added to the radiologist's teaching repertoire, which could be used to enhance the traditional lecture format. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Task Force on Noninterpretive Skills therefore presents a review of several innovative teaching methods, which include the use of audience response technology, long-distance teaching, the flipped classroom, and active learning.

## Introduction

As radiologists, we are adept at interpreting medical images. However, how did we learn this information? Some of this knowledge came from the countless hours spent studying radiology books and journals. However, much of our understanding also came from being taught by others. Thinking back to the great teachers you had—what made them stand out? What made them effective teachers? What interesting techniques did they use to teach?

This review is relevant because as a radiologist you will find you are often called on to teach. Radiologists, especially in the academic setting, are tasked with the education of fellows, residents, and medical students. However, all radiologists, including those in private practice, find themselves in some teaching role—teaching fellow radiologists, other nonradiology physicians, technologists, and patients. Therefore, it is important that radiologists are taught how to effectively educate and, in turn, to act as role models of these skills to trainees.

This is reinforced by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, whose Standard 9.1 requires all residents who interact with and teach medical students to undergo training in effective methods of teaching and evaluation .

Didactic lectures are a well-known form of teaching. However, there are many newer innovative teaching skills, pedagogical techniques, and forms of educational technology that could also be added to a radiologist's teaching repertoire. These could be used to enhance lectures radiologists are already giving or be used in addition to the traditional lecture format.

The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Task Force on Noninterpretive Skills therefore presents a review of innovative teaching methods. Our goal is to present a practical compendium of useful tools and techniques that allow education to become more engaging, more interactive, and more effective:
