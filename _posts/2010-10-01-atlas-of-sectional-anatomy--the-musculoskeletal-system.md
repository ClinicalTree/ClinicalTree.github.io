_Atlas of Sectional Anatomy: The Musculoskeletal System_ by Dr Torsten B. Moeller and Dr Emil Reif of Caritas Hospital in Dillingen, Germany, is a superbly illustrated, comprehensive presentation of the normal sectional anatomy of the musculoskeletal (MSK) system. This highly detailed atlas provides color illustrations with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging correlative anatomy to aid clinicians and radiologists alike in the diagnosis of diseases affecting the joints, soft tissues, bones, and bone marrow.

The atlas sections include coronal whole-body, temporomandibular joint, spine, and upper and lower extremity illustrations and imaging. The section on the temporomandibular joint includes MR images and illustrations in the coronal and sagittal mouth open and closed planes. The upper extremity section includes MR images and illustrations of arm axial, shoulder coronal and sagittal, elbow coronal and sagittal, and hand coronal and sagittal planes. The lower extremity section includes MR images and illustrations of leg axial, hip coronal and sagittal, knee coronal and sagittal, and foot coronal and sagittal planes. A precise, full-color drawing accompanies each high-quality sectional image. Following the model of whole-body imaging atlases, this MSK MR imaging atlas provides complete representations of the spinal column and upper and lower extremities. The contiguous images of the extremities in the axial plane facilitate the identification of structures extending beyond joints.

I find _Atlas of Sectional Anatomy: The Musculoskeletal System_ useful for interested medical students, practicing radiologists, radiology residents and MSK fellows, orthopedists, MSK anatomists, and others generally interested in high-quality MSK MR imaging. The color illustrations with correlative MR images are neatly organized and not cluttered at all. Color illustrations appear at the top and correlative MR images at the bottom of each page. Key anatomic landmarks identified on the side of each page with a small body part figure with a red line in section representing which plane is being imaged.

_Atlas of Sectional Anatomy: The Musculoskeletal System_ is an excellent anatomic atlas with informative detail and high-quality illustrations and imaging. The atlas is a handy reference for normal MSK anatomy for radiologists in training and in practice and should be on the bookshelves of all radiologists interpreting MSK MR images.
