## Rationale and Objectives

Whole-body computed tomography (WBCT) imaging has become commonplace in some emergency departments (EDs) for trauma where management is dependent on rapid diagnosis achieved through comprehensive imaging. The purpose of this study was to assess the value that computed tomography (CT) imaging contributes to trauma patients by retrospectively comparing hospital length of stay (LOS) between WBCT and selective CT imaging, while controlling for hemodynamic stability and socio-economic considerations.

## Materials and Methods

This study was institutional review board approved. The institutional trauma registry database was cross-referenced with our radiology information system database to identify adult patients who sustained blunt trauma between July 2011 and June 2013 and received CT imaging. Propensity score weighting was utilized to achieve balance in baseline covariates, including demographics, hemodynamic stability, Glasgow Coma Scale, and socioeconomic factors. A generalized linear model was used to compare LOS between imaging types, and a multinomial logistic regression was utilized to analyze differences in discharge disposition.

## Results

A total of 2291 patients were identified of which 14.5% underwent WBCT imaging. WBCT patients had an insignificantly longer inpatient hospital LOS of 0.31 days ( _P_ = 0.54), and insignificantly higher odds of being discharged to a nursing home facility (versus home, odds ratio = 1.29 \[ _P_ = 0.34\]) when compared to those who received selective CT.

## Conclusion

WBCT imaging did not have a statistically significant effect on inpatient hospital LOS or discharge disposition.

## Introduction

In the emergency department (ED), computed tomography (CT) utilization has increased threefold between 1996 and 2007, with a quarter of all CTs performed in the United States occurring in the ED . Determining the optimal use and justification for emergent testing is essential to containing the costs of medical care. A critical area of focus for imaging utilization in the ED is in the trauma setting. The early diagnostic evaluation of patients with severe trauma has become increasingly dependent on rapid and comprehensive imaging, with an emphasis on CT over the past two decades . CT distinguishes patients with injuries requiring intervention from patients without critical injuries, so that the trauma team can safely focus on the acute care issues . With rapid data acquisition and improved image quality, whole-body computed tomography imaging (WBCT) (defined as head, C-spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis) is being used with increasing frequency in the trauma setting . However, the use of WBCT imaging in patients with blunt trauma in the ED remains controversial due to (1) the proliferation of potentially unnecessary imaging, (2) the associated risk of radiation exposure, (3) the added cost of the additional imaging, (4) the added time in the scanner, and (5) the expense of further workup of incidental findings .

The literature describing WBCT imaging is mostly from Europe and has found reduced mortality in severe blunt trauma patients who underwent WBCT imaging . However, the generalizability of these results to the United States remains to be determined due to the differences in our health-care systems. The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of trauma imaging strategies on patient outcomes in a US level 1 trauma center. Primary end points included hospital length of stay (LOS) and discharge disposition, while secondary endpoints included intensive care unit (ICU) LOS and mortality rate.
