## Rationale and Objectives

Research on communication between radiologists and women undergoing screening and diagnostic mammography is limited. We describe community radiologists' communication practices with patients regarding screening and diagnostic mammogram results and factors associated with frequency of communication.

## Materials and Methods

We received surveys from 257 radiologists (70% of those eligible) about the extent to which they talk to women as part of their health care visit for either screening or diagnostic mammograms, whether this occurs if the exam assessment is positive or negative, and how they use estimates of patient risk to convey information about an abnormal exam where the specific finding of cancer is not yet known. We also assessed characteristics of the radiologists to identify associations with more or less frequent communication at the time of the mammogram.

## Results

Two hundred and forty-three radiologists provided complete data (95%). Very few (<6%) reported routinely communicating with women when screening mammograms were either normal or abnormal. Fewer than half (47%) routinely communicated with women when their diagnostic mammograms were normal, whereas 77% often or always communicated with women when their diagnostic exams were abnormal. For positive diagnostic exams, female radiologists were more likely to be frequent communicators compared to males (87.1%–72.8%; _P_ = .02) and those who spend 40%–79% of their time in breast imaging (94.6%) were more likely to be frequent communicators compared to those who spend less time (67.2%–78.9%; _P_ = .02). Most radiologists convey risk information using general rather than numeric statements (57.7% vs. 28.5%).

## Conclusions

Radiologists are most likely to convey information about diagnostic mammographic findings when results are abnormal. Most radiologists convey risk information using general rather than numeric statements.

Communication is a key aspect of quality health care, because it fosters trust in the physician-patient relationship . Several studies have focused on patient communication in health care in general and in cancer care in general. Overall, there is consensus that physician-patient communication could be improved . For example, patients often leave health care visits confused about the need for further workup and the therapeutic value of what was done at their last procedure . Another study found that a high degree of physician-initiated communication is associated with patients' perception of having a treatment choice, and higher satisfaction with their cancer care in the 3–6 months after breast surgery .

Though this body of literature is expanding, much less is known about the communication that occurs between radiologists and women undergoing mammography. This is in part due to the fact that the person directly interacting with the patient to obtain the exam is the radiologic technologist rather than the radiologist, but evidence regarding the anxiety women experience when undergoing mammography underscores the need for effective communication. In fact, some research indicates that women experience significant dissatisfaction with the communication they have with radiologists , with one study showing that poor communication between physicians and patients at the time of the mammogram reduced adherence to follow-up examinations . Important limitations exist with the studies conducted on this issue to date, which include assessments done only at academic medical centers and communication that occurs between trainees and patients .
