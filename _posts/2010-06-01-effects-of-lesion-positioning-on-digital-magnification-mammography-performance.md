## Rationale and Objectives

We undertook this study to determine whether differences in detector-lesion distance resulted in appreciable effects on digital magnification mammography performance as measured using the American College of Radiology (ACR) mammography phantom and a line pair test pattern.

## Materials and Methods

Images of the standard 42-mm thick standard ACR mammography phantom with a wax insert on one side containing simulated fibers, calcifications, and masses were obtained on a Senographe Essential digital mammography system with the phantom in upright and inverted positions. The process was repeated with a line pair test pattern for measuring resolution. All images were obtained in contact mode, and with 1.5× and 1.8× magnification, and evaluated on a GE PACS monitor.

## Results

Overall, changing lesion-detector distance using standard versus inverted positioning did not appreciably increase the number of objects seen on the ACR phantom under all modes. No greater than one line pair difference was seen in standard versus inverted positioning. At 1.8× magnification mode, no difference was detected in line pair resolution with a change in positioning.

## Conclusion

Differences in lesion-detector distance as modeled using both the ACR mammography phantom and a line pair test pattern did not make an appreciable difference in digital magnification mammography performance.

Magnification mammography works through the principle of geometric magnification, wherein the breast is placed on a support platform at a fixed position above the detector, so that there is an air gap between the breast and the detector. The rate of magnification is the ratio of the source-to-image (x-ray tube to detector) distance to source-to-object (x-ray tube to breast lesion) distance. Increased magnification allows for increased effective resolution, thereby improving lesion detection and characterization .

The most significant limitation of magnification is geometric blurring caused by finite focal spot size. Larger focal spots and higher magnification increases blurring, which causes a loss of resolution in the projected image. To maintain resolution, a smaller focal spot is used, typically 0.1 mm as opposed to the 0.3 mm focal spot for standard contact mammography. The use of smaller focal spots has been shown to improve image quality in magnification mammography .
