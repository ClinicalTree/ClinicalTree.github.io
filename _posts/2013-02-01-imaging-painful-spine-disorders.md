This first-edition text provides an excellent compilation of radiology case reports for diagnoses associated with back pain. Although most of the conditions concern the spine and spinal canal directly, this text also contains nonspinal diagnoses that may present with back pain (eg, abdominal aortic aneurysm).

The book is divided into two sections. The first section is an imaging-based review of spinal anatomy, using both computed tomographic myelography and magnetic resonance imaging. This section concludes with a detailed description of disc herniation nomenclature.

The second section consists of 74 case reports with the unifying symptom of back pain. Each of these 74 chapters follows the same format: clinical presentation, imaging presentation, discussion, imaging features (with multiple figures), differential diagnosis, treatment, and references. Consequently, the reports are easy to skim for a particular topic of interest (eg, treatment) and compare to other chapters. The reports are listed in alphabetical order, which facilitates searching by diagnosis. As such, the text is a useful study aid for residents, fellows, and general radiologists who wish to learn more about particular disease entities.

Some readers may wish that the reports had been grouped instead by anatomic categories (eg, intracanalicular) or disease categories (eg, neoplasia), which may have increased utility in the reading room. However, the well-organized index allows the reader to search by these other categories. For example, the index listing for “intradural extramedullary tumor” takes the reader to the chapter titled “Intradural Schwannoma,” which includes a detailed differential diagnosis.

In summary, this book is a well-organized collection of interesting case reports with high-quality images and concise, informative text.
