_Essentials of Nuclear Medicine_ remains, through its 6th edition, the best single resource for nuclear medicine with broad coverage of nuclear medicine applications, physics, instrumentation, quality control, and legal requirements.

The book is organized into 13 chapters. The first 2 chapters provide a quick overview of the physics and quality control of nuclear medicine. Chapters 3–9 cover the clinical aspects of nuclear medicine imaging with each chapter dedicated to one body system. Chapters 10 and 11 cover positron emission tomography (PET) and non-PET cancer imaging, and Chapter 12 covers inflammation and infection imaging. The last chapter (Chapter 13) provides an overview of authorized user and radioisotope safety issues. After the chapters, there is a self-evaluation unknown case sets section with amazing high-quality images and detailed answers. This is followed by 13 very high-yield appendices with tables and diagrams that are meant to be used as quick references and cover topics including radionuclide half-lives and body distribution, radioactivity conversion tables, and protocols for nuclear imaging of adults, pregnant patients, and children. An index chapter is provided at the end.

There are many valuable updates to the previous edition, including expanded sections on hybrid imaging (PET and single-photon emission computed tomography), and an addition of approximately 40% more high-quality images (for a total of 400 images).

Other attractive features about this book include the pearls and pitfalls sections at the end of each chapter and the highly organized tables included in each chapter. Another added bonus is that every book purchase comes with an accompanying activation of full online text access to ExpertConsult, which allows the reader to perform quick searches of topics of interest. In addition, another valuable feature of the online access is that most references have direct links to their PubMed abstracts. One potential downside to the online access is that your access will be deactivated once a newer edition is released or the edition is no longer for sale; however, there is usually a gap of a few years (approximately 5 years) between editions.

In conclusion, _Essentials of Nuclear Medicine_ is a must-read book for those interested in nuclear medicine imaging. Every radiology faculty member and resident interested in nuclear medicine and every nuclear medicine reading room should have a copy of this remarkable book.
