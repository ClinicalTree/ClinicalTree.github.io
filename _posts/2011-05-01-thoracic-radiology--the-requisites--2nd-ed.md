The second edition of _Thoracic Radiology: The Requisites_ provides an outstanding overview of thoracic imaging and will be invaluable to the radiologist in training or the practicing radiologist desiring to comprehensively review thoracic imaging in a short period of time. Cardiac imaging is not covered in this text as it is discussed separately in _Cardiac Radiology: The Requisites_ .

The book is well organized and divided into 19 chapters. The first chapter discusses imaging techniques and modalities followed by a detailed discussion of important anatomical considerations and finally important radiographic signs of chest diseases. The following chapters cover specific disease processes, many of which are broken down by anatomic location. Excellent chapters on pulmonary infections, interstitial lung disease, and the pneumoconioses are included. Separate chapters are devoted to congenital abnormalities of the thorax, radiography of the critical care patient, and thoracic trauma. Pulmonary diseases in the immunocompromised host, diseases of altered immunologic activity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pulmonary neoplasms are also covered in separate chapters. Disease processes associated with the trachea, the bronchi, the pulmonary vasculature, the mediastinum, and the pleura are dealt with in dedicated chapters as well. The final chapter discusses interventional techniques.

There are plentiful images that are generally of high quality and illustrate well the full range of imaging characteristics found throughout the spectrum of thoracic pathology. Minor improvements can be made in editing of figure legends/captions; I found few image captions were difficult to see and a few of the labels misleading. There are abundant plain film images, which make this book especially useful for the beginning radiology resident. Numerous computed tomography and magnetic resonance images are included as well. The detailed discussions of the progression of an imaging workup for a number of disease processes would prove useful to radiologists as well as pulmonary specialists outside the field of radiology. There are numerous tables including many complete differential diagnostic entities for various disease processes and imaging findings making this text valuable as a reference in difficult cases. Particularly useful are numerous boxes detailing disease characteristics as well as clinical, pathologic, radiographic, and computed tomography features.

In summary, the book is best suited for the radiology resident, thoracic imaging fellow, and practicing radiologist seeking to thoroughly review aspects of thoracic imaging.
