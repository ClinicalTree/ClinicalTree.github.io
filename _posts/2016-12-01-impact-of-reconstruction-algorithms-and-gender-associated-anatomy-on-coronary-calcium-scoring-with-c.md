## Rationale and Objectives

Different computed tomography imaging protocols and patient characteristics can impact the accuracy and precision of the calcium score and may lead to inconsistent patient treatment recommendations. The aim of this work was to determine the impact of reconstruction algorithm and gender characteristics on coronary artery calcium scoring based on a phantom study using computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Four synthetic heart vessels with vessel diameters corresponding to female and male left main and left circumflex arteries containing calcification-mimicking materials (200–1000 HU) were inserted into a thorax phantom and were scanned with and without female breast plates (male and female phantoms, respectively). Ten scans were acquired and were reconstructed at 3-mm slices using filtered-back projection (FBP) and iterative reconstruction with medium and strong denoising (IR3 and IR5) algorithms. Agatston and calcium volume scores were estimated for each vessel. Calcium scores for each vessel and the total calcium score (summation of all four vessels) were compared between the two phantoms to quantify the impact of the breast plates and reconstruction parameters. Calcium scores were also compared among vessels of different diameters to investigate the impact of the vessel size.

## Results

The calcium scores were significantly larger for FBP reconstruction (FBP > IR3>IR5). Agatston scores (calcium volume score) for vessels in the male phantom scans were on average 4.8% (2.9%), 8.2% (7.1%), and 10.5% (9.4%) higher compared to those in the female phantom with FBP, IR3, and IR5, respectively, when exposure was conserved across phantoms. The total calcium scores from the male phantom were significantly larger than those from the female phantom ( _P_ <  0.05). In general, calcium volume scores were underestimated (up to about 50%) for smaller vessels, especially when scanned in the female phantom.

## Conclusions

Calcium scores significantly decreased with iterative reconstruction and tended to be underestimated for female anatomy (smaller vessels and presence of breast plates).

## Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in American women, and women have higher cardiovascular mortality rates compared to men . A common screening approach for intermediate risk patients is the identification of calcium in the coronary arteries using computed tomography (CT) . The calcium score is used as an overall indicator of coronary health, with higher scores indicating higher risk of coronary artery disease. In general, women have smaller, faster beating hearts, smaller arteries, and a different breast structure compared to men, which can potentially lead to differences in performing quantitative calcium scoring .

Research has been done to standardize and quantify coronary artery calcium in CT, accounting for patient differences. McCollough et al. reported a consensus standard for quantification of coronary artery calcium and reported standardized CT acquisition parameters to achieve comparable image noise, spatial resolution, and mass scores among patients of varying sizes . Willemink et al. recently compared calcium scoring with a smaller 300×200mm

chest phantom in a multivendor phantom study . Willemink et al. showed that the calcium scores were systematically underestimated in a larger chest phantom. Willemink et al. stated that the results were relevant to women in the sense that the thorax attenuation of the women was similar to a larger chest.
