## Rationale and Objectives

Chronic hemodialysis requires a vascular access that provides high blood-flow rates for the extracorporeal recirculation of blood. Synthetic arteriovenous (AV) grafts often fail because of clotting caused by underlying hyperplasia formation. The authors report the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) without contrast agent to monitor tissue hyperplasia formation as well as luminal area in a porcine model of AV graft stenosis.

## Materials and Methods

Expanded reinforced polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were surgically placed between the common carotid artery and the external jugular vein, bilaterally, in pigs. Animals underwent MRI in a 3-T scanner at 3, 4, or 6 weeks after graft placement, followed by euthanasia and the collection of grafts and adjacent tissues for histologic analysis. Two animals underwent sequential scanning at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 weeks after graft placement, followed by histologic analysis.

## Results

Measurements of hyperplasia obtained from the MR images were compared with, and correlated well with, measurements obtained from the histologic cross-sections ( _r_ = 0.932, _P_ = .02). The MR images provided a more complete view of the venous hyperplasia throughout the graft compared with histology. The MR images could be examined from multiple angles and were unaffected by histologic preparation artifacts.

## Conclusion

Unlike histology, MRI provided longitudinal 3-dimensional views of hyperplasia within the AV grafts. This ability of MRI to more completely identify the geometry of hyperplasia and to quantify the tissue volume in vivo could provide benefits over histologic analysis in assessing the pathology of AV graft failure and the efficacy of antihyperplasia interventions.

Chronic hemodialysis requires a vascular access that provides high flow rates for the extracorporeal recirculation of blood. Although the arteriovenous (AV) fistulas created by the anastomosis of native arteries to native veins are the preferred access, synthetic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) AV grafts are also widely used in the United States. Both access types succumb to premature failure because of clotting caused by underlying neointimal hyperplasia formation, although synthetic grafts have a higher rate of failure. The construction and revision of vascular accesses are among the most commonly performed vascular surgery procedures in the United States ( ). Access failure results in significant morbidity in the hemodialysis population, and currently, there is no effective therapy to prevent access failure ( ). Synthetic AV grafts could be the preferred access for hemodialysis if the high occurrence of hyperplasia could be prevented, because they generally have larger luminal diameters and shorter waiting times before use than native fistulas. Thus, research is ongoing to develop strategies to inhibit hyperplasia and prevent graft failure.

Porcine models of AV grafts have been developed for the study of the pathogenesis of hyperplasia and treatment modalities. These models recapitulate the pattern of hyperplasia development observed in clinically failed AV grafts, with hyperplasia developing in an accelerated manner ( ). Thus, these models are very useful for studying strategies to prevent AV graft hyperplasia. The analysis of hyperplasia development in the pig model typically involves survival of the animals for 4 to 8 weeks after graft placement, followed by euthanasia and histologic analysis of the graft-vessel anastomoses. Hyperplasia occurs most often at the juncture of the graft and vessel, but it is also observed within native vessels, upstream and downstream of the anastomosis ( ). Histologic analysis provides two-dimensional (2D) information regarding the size and cellular nature of the hyperplastic lesion. Histologic results from our group and others have shown that lesions consist primarily of cells with smooth muscle cell–like properties and numerous macrophages and macrophage-derived foreign body cells. Lesions are also the site of conspicuous angiogenesis and deposition of the extracellular matrix ( ). Unfortunately, histologic analysis has a number of shortcomings ( ). Because of its labor-intensive nature and expense, only a limited number of samples are typically obtained around a graft-vessel anastomosis. Thus, the access region is generally not completely evaluated, and three-dimensional (3D) information on the lesion area along the length of the vessel is not provided. Also, the fixation of tissue for histology results in shrinkage and some distortion of vessel structure from the in vivo condition. In addition, artifacts often occur during the preparation of thin histologic slices because of differences in cutting resistance between the soft vascular tissues and the more resilient sutures and grafts. The graft material often becomes detached from the tissue during processing, making the results of tissue histology difficult to analyze. Another obvious disadvantage of histologic analysis is that animals must be euthanized to obtain the tissue, precluding any further in vivo studies. For these reasons, a technique that readily yields information regarding hyperplasia development throughout a graft and attached vessels in vivo is needed. The development of such a technique could prove useful for evaluating hyperplasia development in patients as well.

Area of Hyperplasia Determined by Histology and Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging

Arteriovenous grafts were explanted and fixed with formalin directly after MR image acquisition. Hyperplasia surface areas were obtained from MR images using OsiriX software (OsiriX Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland) and from histologic sections using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The areas obtained from histologic sections and from MR images were significantly correlated ( _r_ = 0.932, _P_ = .02). Five different anastomoses from three animals were used.
