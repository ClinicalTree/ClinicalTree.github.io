## Rationale and Objectives

Sonoelastography depicts the intrinsic elastic properties of a tissue which are characterized by the strain applied to achieve tissue deformation and the velocity at which tissue deformation occurs. The present study served to investigate whether the specificity of B-mode ultrasound (US) can be improved by combining B-mode imaging with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and offline analysis of tissue strain imaging (TSI).

## Materials and Methods

Fifty women, 25 with malignant and 25 with benign focal breast lesions, were examined by US with a linear transducer (9 MHz, Aplio, Toshiba, Otawara, Japan). B-mode US views of the lesions were overlaid with color-coded TDI information and area quotients (AQ = area B-mode view/area TDI) were calculated. TSI views were reconstructed offline from the source data. This was done by placing a region of interest (ROI) in the target lesion and color-encoded display of the information. In addition, tissue elasticity was evaluated using a scale of 1–5 corresponding to the BI-RADS categories. Maximum strain (strain factor, SF) was determined in the ROI. All patients also underwent mammography. Sensitivities and specificities were calculated and statistical analysis was performed using Wilcoxon’s test.

## Results

Sensitivity/specificity was 96%/68% for B-mode US, 100%/40% for combined B-mode US and mammography, and 96%/80% for TSI. The AQ of benign and malignant lesions was significantly different (p = .00008) as was the difference in SF (p = .0004). The readers considered TSI a feasible technique.

## Conclusion

Evaluation of elasticity based on the quantification of strain factors improves characterization of focal breast lesions, especially the differentiation of BI-RADS 3 and 4 lesions. Surprisingly, significant results in characterizing breast lesions were obtained with the simple technique of TDI, showing a lower tissue displacement in malignant cases.

The search for a diagnostic test that allows reliable differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions for timely initiation of therapy continues to be a challenge as reflected in the wide range of different modalities that have been proposed. While there have been advances in the individual modalities, the final diagnosis often relies on a combination of mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging, and histological confirmation is obtained before surgery is performed ( ).

The visualization of the pathophysiological changes in tissue properties associated with tumor development was the basis for the development of elasticity measurements, which began in the 1980s ( ). All elastography techniques combine a form of mechanical excitation with measurement of the resulting tissue motion ( ). Reconstruction of the elastic deformability (strain imaging) in real time is known as sonoelastography ( ). The deflections before and after tissue compression are measured semiquantitatively using the shear modulus (Young’s modulus), calculated using a model, and then displayed graphically in the form of an elastogram.
