## Rationale and Objectives

The discovery of germline genetic variants associated with breast cancer has engendered interest in risk stratification for improved, targeted detection and diagnosis. However, there has yet to be a comparison of the predictive ability of these genetic variants with mammography abnormality descriptors.

## Materials and Methods

Our institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study utilized a personalized medicine registry in which participants consented to provide a DNA sample and to participate in longitudinal follow-up. In our retrospective, age-matched, case-controlled study of 373 cases and 395 controls who underwent breast biopsy, we collected risk factors selected a priori based on the literature, including demographic variables based on the Gail model, common germline genetic variants, and diagnostic mammography findings according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). We developed predictive models using logistic regression to determine the predictive ability of (1) demographic variables, (2) 10 selected genetic variants, or (3) mammography BI-RADS features. We evaluated each model in turn by calculating a risk score for each patient using 10-fold cross-validation, used this risk estimate to construct Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) curves, and compared the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of each using the DeLong method.

## Results

The performance of the regression model using demographic risk factors was not statistically different from the model using genetic variants ( _P_ = 0.9). The model using mammography features (AUC = 0.689) was superior to both the demographic model (AUC = .598; _P_ < 0.001) and the genetic model (AUC = .601; _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusions

BI-RADS features exceeded the ability of demographic and 10 selected germline genetic variants to predict breast cancer in women recommended for biopsy.

## Introduction

Over the last several decades, predictive variables have been discovered and incorporated into risk prediction models with the goal of personalizing breast cancer screening and diagnosis. One highly predictive source of information is abnormality level feature descriptors observed on mammography as described in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) . Other emerging sources are the ever-growing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that identify genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms \[SNPs\]). The SNPs discovered via recent GWAS are distinct from mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes . Although both are germline genetic risk factors (inherited from parental lineage), SNPs discovered in recent GWAS are single base pair DNA sequence variations conferring modest risk (low penetrance) but occurring commonly (high frequency) within the human population. Expansion of genetic risk prediction may depend on polygenic risk stratification, that is, weighing many high-frequency, low-penetrance SNPs at once . Early attempts to use such SNPs to predict breast cancer risk have demonstrated only modest improvements over conventional demographic risk factors, like those in the Gail model .

Breast cancer risk is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Intermediate phenotypes like imaging can capture and convey these interactions of these risk factors and provide biomarkers that can augment comprehensive risk prediction. Because demographic risk factors, genetic variants, and imaging features will all likely have some level of predictive value, determining which variables provide the best predictive power in any given setting becomes extremely important. Investing limited resources in collection of the best predictive variables will provide the most benefit. Prior literature evaluated risk prediction with genetics and breast density and one paper added BI-RADS assessment category . Despite the proven predictive ability of abnormality-level features described in the BI-RADS lexicon (e.g. mass and calcification descriptors as well as associated findings like architectural distortion), comparison to demographic or genetic risk has been limited. To estimate breast cancer risk in women recommended for breast biopsy, we compare the performance of predictive models using distinct data elements: demographic risk factors, germline genetic variants, or mammography abnormality features.
