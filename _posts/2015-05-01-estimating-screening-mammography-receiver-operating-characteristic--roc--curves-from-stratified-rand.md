## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate stratified random sampling (SRS) of screening mammograms by (1) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment categories, and (2) the presence of breast cancer in mammograms, for estimation of screening-mammography receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in retrospective observer studies.

## Materials and Methods

We compared observer study case sets constructed by (1) random sampling (RS); (2) SRS with proportional allocation (SRS-P) with BI-RADS 1 and 2 noncancer cases accounting for 90.6% of all noncancer cases; (3) SRS with disproportional allocation (SRS-D) with BI-RADS 1 and 2 noncancer cases accounting for 10%–80%; and (4) SRS-D and multiple imputation (SRS-D + MI) with missing BI-RADS 1 and 2 noncancer cases imputed to recover the 90.6% proportion. Monte Carlo simulated case sets were drawn from a large case population modeled after published Digital Mammography Imaging Screening Trial data. We compared the bias, root-mean-square error, and coverage of 95% confidence intervals of area under the ROC curve (AUC) estimates from the sampling methods (200–2000 cases, of which 25% were cancer cases) versus from the large case population.

## Results

AUC estimates were unbiased from RS, SRS-P, and SRS-D + MI, but biased from SRS-D. AUC estimates from SRS-P and SRS-D + MI had 10% smaller root-mean-square error than RS.

## Conclusions

Both SRS-P and SRS-D + MI can be used to obtain unbiased and 10% more efficient estimate of screening-mammography ROC curves.

Screening mammography for early detection of breast cancer leads to reduction in breast cancer mortality . Radiologists' interpretation of screening mammograms is paramount to the effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which summarizes inherent trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity as the decision threshold is made more or less stringent, is an established method for the assessment of diagnostic performance. However, reliable estimation of ROC curves requires both the diagnostic “truth” (ie, whether breast cancer is present in the mammogram) and an ordinal response for every patient from the radiologist of an estimated “likelihood of malignancy.” Therefore, ROC curves are usually estimated only in retrospective observer-performance studies (hereafter simply observer studies), in which readers provide likelihood of malignancy responses to cases of which diagnostic truth has been independently verified.

It is impractical to estimate screening-mammography ROC curves in observer studies by simple random sampling (RS) of clinical cases because of the low prevalence of breast cancer, approximately five per 1000 screening mammograms . This low cancer prevalence implies large uncertainty in the ROC curve estimate even if the total number of cases is large . Furthermore, 90% or more of all cases will be interpreted as either Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment category 1 (negative) or 2 (benign finding), leading to repetitive and uninteresting studies for the observers . Investigators often increase the prevalence of cancer cases in observer studies by including fewer noncancer cases then seen in clinical practice. This approach can greatly alleviate the difficulty caused by low cancer prevalence and increase the efficiency of the observer study by decreasing the uncertainty of ROC curve estimates without increasing the number of cases in the study.

Observer Study Case Set Sampling Methods


Method Abbreviation Explanation Random sampling RS  ∗  Random sample from large clinical case population Stratified random sampling with proportional allocation SRS-P  ∗  Random sample within each stratum of (1) noncancer cases assigned BI-RADS 1 clinically, (2) noncancer cases assigned BI-RADS 2 clinically, (3) noncancer cases assigned BI-RADS 0 clinically, and (4) cancer cases, with fixed number-of-case ratios between noncancer-case strata identical to those of large clinical case population Stratified random sampling with disproportional allocation SRS-D Random sample within each stratum as in SRS-P, with fixed number-of-case ratios between noncancer-case strata different from those of large clinical case population Stratified random sampling with disproportional allocation with multiple imputation SRS-D + MI Random sample within each stratum as in SRS-P, with fixed number-of-case ratios between noncancer-case strata different from those of large clinical case population. After multiple imputation, the number-of-case ratios between noncancer-case strata becomes identical to those of large clinical case population

The proportion of cancer cases was fixed at 25% for all methods (before multiple imputation).

We used the likelihood of malignancy scores, not the BI-RADS assessment data, to estimate the ROC curve . For cancer cases, we sampled randomly (by proportion) from the DMIST cancer-case likelihood of malignancy score data (  Table 2 ). However, for noncancer cases, we needed to simulate the likelihood of malignancy scores according to BI-RADS assessment categories, 1, 2, and 0, which were not available in the published DMIST data . Instead, we sampled noncancer cases (by proportion) presented in  Table 2 according to three levels of correlation strength between the BI-RADS assessment categories and likelihood of malignancy scores: Spearman correlation coefficients 0.89, 0.80, and 0.69, denoted as high, medium, and low correlation, respectively. These magnitudes of the correlation strength were based on two laboratory observer studies in which observers reported both the BI-RADS assessment and likelihood of malignancy score \[Jiang Y. et al., unpublished data 2003, and Ref. \]. Given differences between retrospective laboratory studies and a prospective clinical trial, and given differences in the proportions of case mix, we chose a fairly wide range in the magnitudes of the correlation strength in an effort to capture the true correlation strength in DMIST, which could not be calculated from the partially published data . Our results (described subsequently) showed little dependence on these choices of the correlation strength.

AUC, area under the curve; BI-RADS, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System; CIs, confidence intervals; RS, random sampling; SRS-D + MI, stratified random sampling with disproportional allocation with multiple imputation; SRS-P, stratified random sampling with proportional allocation.


Results for four of the eight different types (proportion of BI-RADS 1 and 2 cases) of SRS-D + MI case sets are shown.
