## Rationale and Objectives

To document the frequency of normal and anomalous drainage patterns of the pulmonary veins, and to establish normal values for pulmonary vein ostial diameters, and distance to first bifurcation using multidetector computed tomography, as pertinent to ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation.

## Materials and Methods

Two cardiothoracic radiologists retrospectively reviewed thin-section contrast material–enhanced multidetector computed tomography examinations of the thorax in 200 consecutive patients (38 females and 162 males), age 24–79 years (mean 52.8) referred for imaging before radiofrequency ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Pulmonary vein anatomy was based on both the number of venous ostia and the drainage patterns of pulmonary veins. Pulmonary vein ostial diameters and distance to first bifurcation of the four major pulmonary veins (right inferior and superior, left inferior and superior) and any additional pulmonary veins were measured at a workstation using both axial images and multiplanar reconstructions by two experienced cardiothoracic radiologists; the mean pulmonary vein diameter and the shortest distance to first bifurcation of the two measurements are reported.

## Results

The majority of patients, 82% (164 patients) had four pulmonary veins, with a superior and inferior ostium on the right and a superior and inferior ostium on the left. Of the remainder, 9% (18 patients) had five veins, 4.5% (9 patients) had three veins, 3% (6 patients) had two anomalies each, and 0.5% (1 patient) had three anomalies. The middle lobe pulmonary vein drained into the right superior pulmonary vein in 83.5% of patients, directly into the left atrium in 11% of patients, and into the right inferior pulmonary vein in 5.5% of patients; 6.5% of patients had a single left pulmonary vein ostium. Mean pulmonary vein diameters with 95% confidence intervals at the ostia were as follows: right superior 17.6 (13.64–15.36) mm; left superior 16.6 (16.03–17.08) mm; right inferior 17.1 (16.58–17.55) mm; left inferior 14.8 (14.25–15.27) mm, and independent middle lobe 8.6 (8.27–8.86) mm. Mean distance to first bifurcation with 95% confidence intervals were: right superior 14.5 (17.02–18.23) mm; left superior 17.6 (16.63–18.53) mm; right inferior 7.0 (6.49–7.46) mm; left inferior 13.5 (12.83–14.16) mm, and independent middle lobe 8.4 (7.7–9.17) mm.

## Conclusion

Thin-section thoracic computed tomography demonstrates a greater variability of pulmonary venous drainage than previously described. There is greater variability of the right lung venous drainage compared to the left lung. Eighty-two percent of people have four standard pulmonary veins. There is significant variability in pulmonary vein diameter and distance to first bifurcation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and is a major cause of stroke ( ). Treatment is directed at three major objectives: controlling the ventricular response, preventing thromboembolism, and maintaining normal sinus rhythm ( ). In the past few years, radiofrequency ablation of the pulmonary veins has been performed to disconnect the pulmonary veins electrically from the left atrium. Knowledge of ostial diameter facilitates catheter size selection during the ablation procedure. Furthermore, because pulmonary vein narrowing is critically dependent on catheter proximity to a bifurcation and not on duration of radiofrequency energy application, knowledge of the distance from each ostium to the first bifurcation of each pulmonary vein is important to prevent postablation pulmonary vein stenosis ( ). The purpose of our study was twofold: to establish the normative distribution of pulmonary venous drainage and categorize anatomic variations in venous drainage, and to establish normative values for pulmonary vein ostial diameters and distance to first pulmonary venous bifurcation.

## Materials and methods

## Subjects

Two hundred consecutive pulmonary vein mapping computed tomography (CT) examinations performed before radiofrequency ablation therapy for atrial fibrillation were retrospectively reviewed by two cardiothoracic radiologists. Of the 200 subjects (38 women and 162 men), women ranged in age from 24 to 73 years (mean age 56.8 years), and men ranged in age from 28 to 79 years (mean age 51.8 years). There was no statistically significant difference in ages between genders. This study was approved by our institutional review board.
