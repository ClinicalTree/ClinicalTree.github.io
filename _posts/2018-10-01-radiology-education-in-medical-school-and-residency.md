## Rationale and Objectives

The authors of this study used the perspectives of residency program directors (PDs) nationally to explore whether trainees are adequately prepared to utilize and interpret medical imaging as interns, to identify the types of imaging skills most important for residency, and to begin to address current shortcomings in radiology education.

## Materials and Methods

The authors created a survey using a modified version of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education radiology milestones and sent it to 100 randomly selected PDs each in pediatrics, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, and general surgery. The survey asked PDs to assess the actual and desired imaging skills of their incoming interns, the incoming interns' variability of skill level upon matriculation, and which imaging skills were most important from the PDs' perspective.

## Results

PDs from all specialties identified a significant shortcoming relative to their expectations for both image interpretation and utilization skills. Additionally, PDs identified a significant variability in imaging skills, and described that variability as a hindrance to their programs. All of the potential imaging skills were rated as highly important with little clinically relevant difference between them.

## Discussion

This multidisciplinary national survey found a deficiency in imaging education among interns across specialties and substantiates calls for formalized and improved radiology education in undergraduate medical education. Additionally, PDs had difficulty distinguishing which skills were most important, suggesting an unclear understanding of imaging ability needs for interns in respective specialties. More specific needs assessments are warranted on a national level.

## Introduction

Medical imaging has become increasingly integral to the practice of medicine and, accordingly, increasingly emphasized in undergraduate medical education (UME) . However, there are variations in how much is taught in medical school, ranging from no formal imaging education to required radiology clerkships . Additionally, there are large variations in what is taught to medical students , despite the existence of published curriculum recommendations . Prior studies report that graduate medical education (GME) trainees, medical school deans, and radiology chairs desire a concerted effort to strengthen imaging skills in the UME curriculum . Importantly, some major specialties, such as internal medicine, fail to include even one imaging milestone in their standardized assessments , currently leaving formal development and assessment of imaging skills solely to the UME curriculum.

Considering these existing shortcomings, it seems unlikely that current UME in the United States is sufficiently providing the imaging skills most useful for intern year. In fact, a national study of interns recently reported a lack of confidence in a variety of important imaging skills, including determining normal from abnormal in basic imaging modalities, indications for various imaging tests, and when to consult radiologists . A convenience sample survey of program directors (PDs) from a variety of specialties identified that interns were generally adequately prepared ; however, this early study had a limited sampling frame and did not account for variation between specialties. Thus, the question remains whether UME is sufficiently preparing students for clinical practice as interns.
