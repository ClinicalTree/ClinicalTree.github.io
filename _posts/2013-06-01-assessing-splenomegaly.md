## Rationale and Objectives

To define systematic volumetric thresholds to identify and grade splenomegaly and retrospectively evaluate the performance of radiologists to assess splenomegaly in computed tomography (CT) image data.

## Materials and Methods

A clinical tool was developed to segment spleens from 172 contrast-enhanced clinical CT studies. There were 45 normal and 127 splenomegaly cases confirmed by radiological reports. Spleen volumes were compared to manual measurements using overlap/error. Volumetric thresholds for mild/massive splenomegaly were defined at 1/2.5 standard deviations above the average splenic volume of the healthy population. The thresholds were validated against consensus reports. The performance of radiologists in assessing splenomegaly was retrospectively evaluated.

## Results

The automated segmentation of spleens was robust with volume overlap/error of 95.2/3.3%. There were no significant differences ( _P >_ .2) between manual and automated segmentations for either normal/splenomegaly subgroups. Comparable correlations between interobserver and manual-automated measurements were found ( _r_ = 0.99 for all). The average volume of normal spleens was 236.89 ± 77.58 mL. For splenomegaly, average volume was 1004.75 ± 644.27 mL. Volumetric thresholds of 314.47/430.84 mL were used to define mild/massive splenomegaly (±18.86 mL, 95% CI). Radiologists disagreed in 23.25% ( _n_ = 40) of the diagnosed cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the volumetric criterion for splenomegaly detection was 0.96. Using the volumetric thresholds as the reference standard, the sensitivity of radiologists in detecting all/mild/massive splenomegaly was 95.0/66.6/99.0% at 78.0% specificity, respectively.

## Conclusion

Thresholds for the identification and grading of splenomegaly from automatic volumetric spleen assessment were introduced. The volumetric thresholds match well with clinical interpretations for splenomegaly and may improve splenomegaly detection compared with splenic cephalocaudal height measurements or visual inspection commonly used in current clinical practice.

The enlargement of the spleen, or splenomegaly, is the most common condition associated with diseases of the spleen . Splenomegaly is a nonspecific finding that is diagnostically challenging to assess because the manifestation is nearly always secondary to another primary disorder, and diseases associated with the spleen are numerous . Pozo et al grouped them into six categories: infection, hematological, congestive, inflammatory, neoplastic, and infiltrative miscellaneous diseases . Hematological disorders were found to be the most common (up to 66%), with lymphoma being the most prevalent disease within the category.

The assessment of spleen size, defined by its volume, is of importance in the diagnosis of and determination of the severity of many of these diseases and in the selection and monitoring of therapies. Moreover, given the spleen's irregular shape, volume is the best summary indicator of spleen changes over time. It is common clinical practice for physicians to estimate splenic size and assess for an enlarged spleen using palpation . In palpation, the spleen is considered normal in size when it is not palpable below the left costal edge ; if the spleen is palpable, it is enlarged. But 16% of palpable spleens were found to be of normal size on radiological assessments .
