## Rationale and Objectives

The treatment of glioma with bevacizumab results in decreased enhancement, making it challenging to diagnose tumor recurrence. Therefore, the primary aim of this retrospective study was to determine if the underlying biological processes occurring within regions of recurrent glioblastoma in patients undergoing bevacizumab therapy influence morphologic and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics.

## Materials and Methods

In this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant and institutional review board–approved study, 26 patients treated with bevacizumab for high-grade glioma underwent lesion-wide apparent diffusion coefficient analysis before therapy and at the time of clinical/radiological progression, allowing for stratification by the presence or absence of reduced diffusion. Lesions with reduced diffusion were classified into “block” or “salt & pepper” phenotypes. Eight of the 26 patients underwent image-guided tissue sampling at the time of suspected disease recurrence allowing for direct biological correlation. Clinical, histologic, and MR imaging differences between diffusion groups were assessed using a two-sample Welch _t_ test.

## Results

All patients had histologic evidence of recurrent disease with or without a background of treatment effect. Sixty-two percent of the cohort had developed reduced diffusion at clinical progression following bevacizumab. Image-guided tissue sampling demonstrated that treatment effect was not observed within regions of reduced diffusion. Recurrent tumor intermixed with treatment effect was more likely to be observed within the “salt & pepper” phenotype when compared to “block” phenotype.

## Conclusions

Following bevacizumab therapy, recurrent glioblastoma can manifest as nonenhancing regions characterized by reduced diffusion. Histologically, these MR imaging characteristics correlate with aggressive biological features of disease recurrence.

## Introduction

High-grade glioma is the malignant form of primary glial neoplasms; the presence of which forebodes poor prognosis. Vascular endothelial growth factor, a hypoxia-regulated gene, is a powerful mediator of tumor progression via its role in tumor angiogenesis and vascular hyperplasia. Bevacizumab, a nonselective monoclonal antibody (mAb) for vascular endothelial growth factor, is clinically used for its antiangiogenic properties in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.

Currently, the post-therapeutic radiological diagnosis of high-grade glioma recurrence is, in part, characterized by progressive contrast enhancement on serial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The presence of contrast enhancement is predicated on the expression of leaky microvasculature. The antiangiogenic effects of bevacizumab histologically causes pseudonormalization of the tumor microvasculature that is biologically manifested as reduced vascular permeability, reduced interstitial pressure, and diminished contrast-enhancing volume on MR imaging. As a result, it can be clinically challenging, in the setting of concurrent bevacizumab administration, to determine whether increasing T2 hyperintensity within a region of diminishing contrast enhancement is a hallmark of tumor response to therapy or the development of nonenhancing recurrent tumor.
