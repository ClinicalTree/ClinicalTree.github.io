## Rationale and Objectives

The authors performed this study to develop, implement, and evaluate a dedicated core clerkship in radiology for the required clinical clerkship year of medical school, and to compare it with the distributed core clerkship that it replaced.

## Materials and Methods

A dedicated 5-day clerkship was added to the clinical core year of medical school. The course offered a variety of learning experiences, including lectures, clinical observation, case discussions, and a team project. Learner achievement was measured by posttest and compared with a control group. Student satisfaction was determined by structured and unstructured surveys. Faculty comment was elicited by survey, and administrative staff perspective was established through interviews. The evaluation of the dedicated clerkship was compared with the distributed clerkship along the dimensions of learner achievement, student satisfaction, faculty comment, and administrative staff perspective.

## Results

The dedicated clerkship was developed and implemented successfully. Compared with the distributed clerkship, there was no significant difference in learner achievement or student satisfaction for the dedicated clerkship, but the dedicated clerkship was easier to conduct for faculty and administrative staff.

## Conclusion

The dedicated clerkship was advantageous for faculty and administrative staff, whereas maintaining a comparable level of learner achievement and student satisfaction as the distributed clerkship.

In 1998, our medical school implemented a new undergraduate curriculum that stressed problem-based learning and computer delivery of instructional materials. To this end, all medical students were provided with laptop computers and technical support, and the local area network was expanded to cover the entire medical center. This created the opportunity to augment instruction in diagnostic radiology during various portions of the curriculum by incorporating computer aided instruction (CAI) radiology modules, however radiology was not originally included among the core clinical rotations. After a process of negotiation with the curriculum committee and the core clerkship directors, a required radiology clerkship was accepted into the core clinical year as a series of 10 independent half-day teaching sessions distributed throughout the year, and partially integrated with existing clerkships.

Web-based curriculum materials, in-class lectures, and tutorials were developed for the radiology clerkship. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that a Web-supported radiology curriculum distributed over a required clinical clerkship year was feasible, but several disadvantages were observed ( ). The disadvantages included discontinuity in episodes of teaching, conflicts with patient care responsibilities in other rotations that prevented students from attending all lectures and tests, and complex administration and scheduling. It had been hoped that the clinical rotations into which the radiology sessions were integrated would complement one another. Unavoidably, nevertheless, schedules were often in conflict and at times the radiologic topics did not correlate well with the clinical clerkships. The success of the distributed core clerkship, in spite of its disadvantages, ultimately led the medical school to consolidate it as a 5-day dedicated clerkship within the required clinical core year.
