## Rationale and Objectives

To compare programs with and without 24-hour/7 days a week/365 days a year (24/7/365) in-house radiologist coverage regarding resident perceptions of their on-call experience, volume of resident dictations on call, and report turnaround time.

## Materials and Methods

Residents from six academic radiology departments were invited to participate in an 11-item online survey. Survey items were related to workload, level of autonomy, faculty feedback, comfort level, faculty supervision, and overall educational experience while on call from 8  pm to 8  am . Each site provided data on imaging volume, radiologist coverage, volume of examinations dictated by residents, number of residents on call, and report turnaround time from 8  pm to 8  am . F-ratios and eta-squares were calculated to determine the relationships between dependent and independent variables. A _P_ value < .05 was considered statistically significant.

## Results

A total of 146 (67%) of 217 residents responded. Residents in programs with 24/7/365 in-house radiologist coverage dictated a lower percentage of examinations (46%) compared with other residents (81%) and rated faculty feedback more positively (mean 3.8 vs. 3.3) but rated their level of autonomy (mean 3.6 vs. 4.5) and educational experience (mean 3.6 vs. 4.2) more negatively (all _P_ < .05). Report turnaround time was lower in programs with 24/7/365 coverage than those without (mean 1.7 hours vs. 9.1 hours). The majority of resident comments were negative and related to loss of autonomy with 24/7/365 coverage.

## Conclusion

More rapid report turnaround time related to 24/7/365 coverage may come at the expense of resident education.

A 2007 survey conducted by the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments showed that 10% of responding institutions had 24-hour in-house coverage by faculty radiologists . The conclusion from this survey was “coverage by attending radiologists around the clock is not the current standard of practice at most academic medical centers.” A series of surveys conducted by the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology (A3CR2) showed that the percentage of academic radiology departments with 24-hour/7 days a week/365 days a year (24/7/365) in-house radiologist coverage had gradually increased from 4% in 2002 to 7% in 2004 to 14% in 2005 (dropping slightly to 12% in 2009) up to 20% in 2012, with an additional 7.5% planning implementation by 2013 . The justifications for expansion of radiologist coverage into areas traditionally handled by radiology residents alone have included: 1) increased imaging service expectations from emergency medicine and trauma surgery physicians 2) positive impact of immediate finalization of radiology reports (eg, decreased patient recall rates) , 3) past reports of frequent significant discrepancies between interpretations by radiology residents and radiology attendings , 4) potential “turf battles” over control of emergency imaging , and 5) the need to link the attending activities with nighttime coverage of other vital inpatient activities (eg, intensive care unit image interpretation). Arguments against the expanded role of the radiology attending focus on the lack of recent evidence of significant discrepancies between interpretations by radiology residents (especially senior level) and radiology attendings for either medical or traumatic emergencies, often accompanied by recommendations to not deprive the radiology resident of a valuable experience in professional autonomy .

The 2008 report of an Institute of Medicine committee on resident duty hours strongly endorsed greater supervision of residents, stating “the committee found that closer supervision leads to fewer errors, lower patient mortality, and improved quality of care” . Increased faculty presence could serve to counter the “hidden curriculum,” which substantially affects resident perceptions of supervision and may act as a barrier to requesting assistance, even when it is clearly necessary . The risk to such a system includes the potential to undermine resident autonomy.
