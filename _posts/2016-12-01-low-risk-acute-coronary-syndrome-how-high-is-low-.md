Consistently, 6–8 million patients visit to the emergency department (ED) for chest pain annually, with about 15% ultimately diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) . Despite improved biomarker sensitivity, the risk of missed diagnosis of ACS remains high, with estimates remaining approximately 2% at 7 days . Furthermore, there is significant variation among hospitals and clinicians, with one recent study showing miss rates between 0% and 26% . The risk-adjusted mortality of discharged patients is nearly twice of those patients hospitalized with ACS .

Missed diagnosis of ACS tops the list of highest dollar awards in malpractice cases every year in the United States, accounting for nearly 30% of all dollars paid out. Whereas missed fracture and infection cases are more common malpractice lawsuits overall, missed ACS awards are so high because the cases often end in death or severe disability of relatively young and seemingly “healthy” patients . Given these parameters, emergency physicians have a low risk tolerance for missed cases. In a recent international survey of emergency medicine physicians, over 85% of physicians believe that the acceptable miss rate is <1% .

Thus, for the emergency physician, the question is who are the low risk patients who do not need any further testing? Current guidelines by the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) are unclear; the recommendation is that “stable patients with no objective evidence of ischemia are considered low risk and can be admitted to an observation unit for further evaluation by an accelerated diagnostic protocol” . The guidelines further define “low risk” as a probability of myocardial infarction (MI) of <6%. For these patients, “a negative evaluation is followed by a confirmatory study to exclude inducible ischemia” . The confirmatory studies recommended by the guidelines include exercise treadmill testing and cardiac imaging. Effectively, these guidelines require that patients receive both an AMI “rule out” and an assessment for underlying coronary disease or inducible ischemia.

Low risk cannot be defined by physician history or physical examination; these tools have not been proven to be a powerful enough predictive tool to obviate the need for at least some diagnostic testing . Combinations of elements of the chest pain history with other initially available information, such as a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), have identified certain groups that may be safe for discharge without further evaluation, but further study is needed before such a recommendation can be considered reasonable. Those patients whose physicians felt had a clear-cut noncardiac diagnosis for their chest pain still have up to a 4% risk of adverse cardiovascular event within 30 days . In order to objectively evaluate the risk, risk stratification tools help physicians define the pretest probability of patients. The most commonly used scores include the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. The TIMI risk score was derived from the original score developed for unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Its use for risk stratification in the ED population has been validated in several studies. However, a TIMI score of 0 still presents almost a 2% risk of 30-day adverse cardiovascular events, limiting its use as a tool for the rapid discharge of patients . Physician judgment of a clear-cut alternative diagnosis in those with low TIMI risk scores still had a significant 2.9% risk of 30-day adverse cardiovascular events . The only patient group that does not need further risk stratification are patients younger than 40 years old with chest pain: in these young adult patients without a known cardiac history, either no classic cardiac risk factors or a normal electrocardiogram (ECG), and initially normal cardiac marker studies, the risk of ACS was also extremely low (0.14%) and there were no adverse events at 30-day follow-up .

The HEART score was developed more recently and gives some flexibility with 0, 1, or 2 points for each category of history, ECG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin values. In one prospective validation study by the creators of the score, 2440 patients were enrolled. Those with a low HEART score (values 0–3) represented 36.4% of the study population. Six-week major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) occurred in 15 out of 870 (1.7%) patients . Although these risk scores help stratify patients, they do not identify a cohort of patients at low enough risk for no further testing.

The incremental benefit of cardiovascular testing and imaging depends on the pretest probability of the patient being evaluated. In a low pretest probability patient cohort, a diagnostic test with a high likelihood ratio negative is necessary to meet that acceptable miss rate of <1%. Exercise stress testing had negative likelihood ratios of 0.28 in the low risk patient population . A recent meta-analysis showed a pooled negative likelihood ratio for coronary CT angiography (CTA) of 0.11 at a per-segment level. Assuming a low pretest probability, the posttest probability for any of these imaging studies would be <2%.
