## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine how often breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI) identifies occult cancerous lesions in women with one suspicious lesion detected on mammography or physical exam.

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed of the records of all patients who underwent BSGI between January 1, 2004, and June 4, 2007. Included in the study were 159 women who had one suspicious breast lesion on physical exam and/or mammography and who underwent BSGI to evaluate for occult lesions in the breast. All patients had one or more foci of cancer proven pathologically. BSGI findings were classified as normal or abnormal on the basis of the presence of focal radiotracer uptake.

## Results

BSGI detected additional suspicious lesions occult to mammography and physical exam in 46 of 159 women (29%). BSGI identified occult cancer in 14 of 40 women (35%) who underwent biopsy or excision because of BSGI findings and in 14 of the 159 (9%) women in this study. In nine women, the occult cancer was present in the same breast as the index lesion (6%), and in five women, the occult cancer was found in the contralateral breast (3%).

## Conclusions

BSGI is an effective imaging modality in the identification of mammographically and clinically occult cancer in women with one suspicious breast lesion.

Breast conservation surgery has replaced mastectomy as the preferred treatment for early-stage breast cancer . However, when two or more primary tumors are located in different quadrants of the breast, breast-conserving therapy is contraindicated . Routine physical examinations and mammography are the most common methods for early cancer detection, but they have diagnostic limitations. A study of 282 mastectomy specimens (performed for unifocal breast cancer) found that 63% of breasts had additional sites of cancer not detected by clinical examination or mammography, including 7% with additional foci of cancer in a different quadrant of the breast . Additional analyses of the pathology of mastectomy specimens have shown sites of cancer other than the index lesion in 20% to 63% . To achieve the highest possible level of diagnostic accuracy in the preoperative radiologic assessment, additional imaging techniques may be used. These include ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI). Ultrasound, the primary diagnostic adjunct to mammography, aids in the diagnostic evaluation of mammographic findings and is used to guide interventional procedures . Houssami et al reported sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 79% for the combination of mammography and breast ultrasound in the identification of breast cancer.

Although mammography and ultrasound are predominantly anatomic in their approach to breast cancer diagnosis, MRI and BSGI rely on physiologic changes for the evaluation of breast cancer. Molecular breast imaging, or BSGI, uses a high-resolution, small–field of view gamma camera specific to breast imaging , which has demonstrated improved sensitivity for the detection of breast cancer . The sensitivity of BSGI ranges from 78.6% to 100% for detecting breast cancer, which is comparable to that of MRI (73%–100%) . Breast MRI and BSGI are similar in their ability to detect intraductal cancer, with sensitivities reported ranging from 88% and 92% for breast MRI and 91% to 94% for BSGI . Additionally, both breast MRI and BSGI can detect breast cancers that are mammographically and clinically occult . BSGI can detect subcentimeter occult cancers as small as 1 mm . The reported specificities of BSGI and breast MRI are also similar, ranging from 59.5% to 93.3% for BSGI and from 37% to 97% for breast MRI . Although BSGI and MRI are similar in their ability to detect breast cancer, BSGI has advantages in ease of performing the examination for patients and in interpretation for radiologists. Although MRI may be difficult for patients with claustrophobia and not possible in patients with renal insufficiency, implantable devices, or large body habitus, BSGI can be performed in any woman with venous access. A breast MRI examination often generates >1000 images, compared to four to 10 images with BSGI, with a concomitant decrease in interpretation time. Although formal cost analysis studies are needed to further evaluate the relative costs, both the equipment and the cost of the study are lower with BSGI.
