## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to compare the breast density estimates from two algorithms on full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and to analyze the clinical implications.

## Materials and Methods

We selected 561 FFDM and DBT examinations from patients without breast pathologies. Two versions of a commercial software (Quantra 2D and Quantra 3D) calculated the volumetric breast density automatically in FFDM and DBT, respectively. Other parameters such as area breast density and total breast volume were evaluated. We compared the results from both algorithms using the Mann-Whitney _U_ non-parametric test and the Spearman's rank coefficient for data correlation analysis. Mean glandular dose (MGD) was calculated following the methodology proposed by Dance et al.

## Results

Measurements with both algorithms are well correlated (r ≥ 0.77). However, there are statistically significant differences between the medians ( _P_ < 0.05) of most parameters. The volumetric and area breast density median values from FFDM are, respectively, 8% and 77% higher than DBT estimations. Both algorithms classify 35% and 55% of breasts into BIRADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) _b_ and _c_ categories, respectively. There are no significant differences between the MGD calculated using the breast density from each algorithm. DBT delivers higher MGD than FFDM, with a lower difference (5%) for breasts in the BIRADS _d_ category. MGD is, on average, 6% higher than values obtained with the breast glandularity proposed by Dance et al.

## Conclusions

Breast density measurements from both algorithms lead to equivalent BIRADS classification and MGD values, hence showing no difference in clinical outcomes. The median MGD values of FFDM and DBT examinations are similar for dense breasts (BIRADS _d_ category).

## Introduction

Millions of women undergo breast cancer screening with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) every year. The assessment of breast density has been an important component of mammography screening reports that provides information on mammographic sensitivity and relative risk of breast cancer. Recently, legislation in several US states requires that patients be informed about breast density and the potential for decreased mammographic sensitivity and increased cancer risk . Lately, digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) has been proposed as an imaging modality to overcome the limitations of the conventional mammography regarding thicker or dense breasts. The inclusion of DBT as a screening tool is currently under debate , and the higher dose delivered in DBT with respect to digital mammography is a matter of great concern .

The breast is one of the most radiosensitive organs, and the estimation of radiation dose delivered to breast tissue is critical in screening programs. It is generally assumed that glandular tissue is the most radiosensitive component in the breast, with adipose tissue presenting a minimal risk of cancer development . Therefore, the mean dose delivered to the glandular tissue within the breast has been established as the standard risk metric in mammographic examinations . Because of the intricacy of having reliable information about breast glandular distribution, the mean glandular dose (MGD) was estimated for a long time by assuming in all patients a breast tissue composition of 50% fibroglandular (or dense) and 50% adipose.
