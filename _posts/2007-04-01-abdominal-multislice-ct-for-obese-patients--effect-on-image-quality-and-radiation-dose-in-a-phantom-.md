## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the effect of a modified abdominal multislice computed tomography (CT) protocol for obese patients on image quality and radiation dose.

## Materials and Methods

An adult female anthropomorphic phantom was used to simulate obese patients by adding one or two 4-cm circumferential layers of fat-equivalent material to the abdominal portion. The phantom was scanned with a subcutaneous fat thickness of 0, 4, and 8 cm using the following parameters (detector configuration/beam pitch/table feed per rotation/gantry rotation time/kV/mA): standard protocol A: 16 × 0.625 mm/1.75/17.5 mm/0.5 seconds/140/380, and modified protocol B: 16 × 1.25 mm/1.375/27.5 mm/1.0 seconds/140/380. Radiation doses to six abdominal organs and the skin, image noise values, and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were analyzed. Statistical analysis included analysis of variance, Wilcoxon rank sum, and Student’s _t_ -test ( _P_ < .05).

## Results

Applying the modified protocol B with one or two fat rings, the image noise decreased significantly ( _P_ < .05), and simultaneously, the CNR increased significantly compared with protocol A ( _P_ < .05). Organ doses significantly increased, up to 54.7%, comparing modified protocol B with one fat ring to the routine protocol A with no fat rings ( _P_ < .05). However, no significant change in organ dose was seen for protocol B with two fat rings compared with protocol A without fat rings (range −2.1% to 8.1%) ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusions

Using a modified abdominal multislice CT protocol for obese patients with 8 cm or more of subcutaneous fat, image quality can be substantially improved without a significant increase in radiation dose to the abdominal organs.

Obesity is a growing, major public health problem in many countries around the world ( ). According to a recent article in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_ , about one-third of adults in the United States—more than 90 million people—are obese (defined as a body mass index of 30 or higher) ( ). Furthermore, a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity in male adolescents was observed between 1999 and 2004 ( ). Obesity is associated with various medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cholelithiasis, abdominal hernias, and different types of cancers (eg, breast and colon cancer) ( ).

The use of computed tomography (CT) as a diagnostic tool plays a major role in the work-up of obese patients with abdominal comorbidities or postoperative complication after bariatric surgery. However, insufficient image quality is frequently a concern with abdominal CT examination of these patients, owing to a greater absorption of the x-ray beam by the subcutaneous and visceral fat. Fewer incident photons contribute to image formation, which results in increased image noise. To obtain diagnostic-quality images, the radiologist needs to modify existing CT protocols when examining obese patients. One effective and practical approach to improve image quality in obese patients is to increase the x-ray tube output ( ). In a corpulent patient, the radiation dose to the abdominal organs is expected to be smaller than in a slim patient using the same CT protocol because the additional subcutaneous and visceral fat might serve as unintended radiation protection by attenuating more incident photons. To date, no reports, to the best of our knowledge, on image quality and radiation dose for abdominal multislice CT scan in obese patients have been published in the scientific literature.
