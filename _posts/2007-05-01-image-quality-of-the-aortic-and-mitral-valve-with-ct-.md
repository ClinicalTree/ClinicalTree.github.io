## Rationale and Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare image quality and artifacts of 16-detector row CT imaging of the aortic and mitral valve when performing ECG-gated synchronization using relative and absolute reconstructions.

## Materials and Methods

Cardiac CT was performed in 22 consecutive patients; 20 data sets per RR interval were reconstructed with relative and absolute reconstructions. Mean and variability of heart rate during data acquisition were noted. Two readers assessed contrast media–related artifacts, calcification-related artifacts, ECG gating–related artifacts, and image quality in parallel and perpendicular planes.

## Results

Contrast media–related and calcification-related artifacts similarly occurred with both reconstruction techniques. ECG gating–related artifacts occurred in both valves more often with relative reconstructions than with absolute reconstructions ( _p_ = .001). Image quality was significantly better for absolute reconstructions for the open aortic cusp surface ( _p_ = .014) and edge ( _p_ = .008) in both planes, and of the closed mitral valve leaflets ( _p_ = .003) and apposition zone ( _p_ = .003) in perpendicular planes. Occurrence of ECG gating–related artifacts in both valves significantly correlated ( _p_ = .01) with heart rate variability for relative reconstructions, whereas no correlation was found using the absolute technique.

## Conclusion

Absolute reconstructions allow CT imaging of the aortic and mitral valve with fewer artifacts and are less sensitive to heart rate variability as compared to relative reconstructions.

Multidetector row computed tomography (CT) combined with retrospective electrocardiography (ECG) gating allows reconstruction of images of coronary artery and ventricular anatomy with high temporal and spatial resolution at arbitrary phases of the cardiac cycle ( ). Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of CT for imaging the normal and diseased mitral ( ) and aortic ( ) valve, indicating CT to be a modality that can evaluate not only coronary arteries and ventricular function but also cardiac valves. In the studies on animated CT imaging of the aortic and mitral valve, one of the main sources of image quality degradation were ECG gating–related artifacts occurring in approximately 50% of the patients ( ). This type of artifact derives from misregistration between the software-detected ECG signal and cardiac motion caused by improper detection of the R wave, sinus arrhythmia during CT data acquisition, bundle blocks, or supraventricular arrhythmias. This type of artefacts affects the temporal synchronization of adjacent parts of the image stack.

Several algorithms to reconstruct cardiac CT data in relation to the ECG signal are commonly performed ( ). In the most widely used approach, data are reconstructed at a relative delay based on each individual R wave throughout the data acquisition. Another common approach is characterized by data reconstruction at an absolute prospective or reverse delay based on the previous or upcoming R wave, respectively. Interestingly, no data directly comparing the two different reconstruction approaches are currently available to prove the superiority of either reconstruction method for imaging cardiac valves. The purpose of our study was to compare image quality and artifacts of animated CT imaging of the aortic and mitral valve when performing ECG-gated synchronization using the relative and the absolute approach in the same patient population, and to correlate artifacts with the mean heart rate and heart rate variability during data acquisition.

![Figure 1, Schematic drawing illustrating the principle differences of relative delay reconstructions (blue bars at 50% and 100% of the RR interval of the actual cardiac cycle) and heart rate–adapted absolute reconstructions (red bars for 50% and 100% of RR mean in case of sinus arrhythmia). RR mean is the mean RR interval duration for the entire data acquisition. The graph shows three consecutive QRS complexes (QRS 1,2,3 ) and two RR intervals (R 1 R 2 and R 2 R 3 ). The interval length R 1 R 2 is assumed to equal RR mean (i.e., 1000 ms). Note that both techniques result in identical reconstruction time intervals at constant heart rates. If the actual heart rate differs from the mean heart rate (as shown for R 2 R 3 ), the two techniques result in reconstructions at different time points of the cardiac cycle. The differences Δ between both techniques are shown as pink bars for 50% and 100% of the cardiac cycle. Absolute reconstruction results in nearly identical reconstruction phases for systolic to mid-diastolic imaging for R 1 R 2 and R 2 R 3 despite variations of RR interval length.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ImageQualityoftheAorticandMitralValveWithCT/0_1s20S1076633207000888.jpg)
