One of the greatest challenges in modern health care is distributing the fruits of medical progress in an equitable, universal, and cost-effective manner. The traditional fee-for-service payment model is being abandoned over concerns of increasing utilization. Newly adopted payment models, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, are still untested for consultant services, in which imaging's share of resources may be challenged. The development of these new health care systems will be shaped by multiple interest groups.

Decision-making power, vested with politicians and bureaucracy, is subject to the influence of public opinion shaped by industry groups, such as the insurance industry and medical societies through their lobbying efforts. The influence wielded by these societies is directly proportional to the size of their membership. The largest medical society is the American Medical Association (AMA). It is a democratic organization with a House of Delegates, which functions as a legislative branch that sets the policies of the Association.

Similar to the AMA, specialties have their own societies in which physicians from that specialty can organize to unify their efforts for the betterment of their patients and their ability to care for these patients. The largest organization concerned with the economics and politics of radiology is the American College of Radiology (ACR). It comprises 34,000 radiologists, radiation oncologists, and medical physicists, who are represented through the Council, Council Steering Committee, and Board of Chancellors.

The AMA and the ACR have both been crucial in the development of health care reform in this country. The AMA has a long history in helping medicine self-regulate, a key distinction as a profession. Top priorities for the AMA at this time include: repeal of the flawed sustainable growth rate, medical liability reform, payment reform, increasing funding for residency spots, elimination of health disparities, and reduction of bureaucratic hassle in the practice of medicine.

The ACR has long been a champion for radiologists and our patients. It has been proactive in educating the public about ionizing radiation and referring physicians about appropriate use of radiological studies. Recent ACR initiatives include a strong opposition to the extension of multiple procedure payment reduction (MPPR) implemented on the technical component to include the professional component. In pursuit of this effort, the ACR has championed HR 3269 the Diagnostic Imaging Access Protection Act of 2011, which seeks to suspend the imposition of MPPR policies to the professional component. At the time of the writing of this article, the bill has the support of 265 members of the House of Representatives and 40 medical specialties.

Participation in these organizations enables individual physicians to influence policymaking at the national level. Physicians must educate politicians on the adverse or unintended consequences of health care legislation. Lawmakers are swayed by personal experiences and seek information on how a current law may affect your relationship with patients and what issues are currently interfering with best medical practice.
