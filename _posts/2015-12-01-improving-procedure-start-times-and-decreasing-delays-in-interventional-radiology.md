## Rationale and Objectives

To identify and reduce reasons for delays in procedure start times, particularly the first cases of the day, within the interventional radiology (IR) divisions of the Department of Radiology using principles of continuous quality improvement.

## Materials and Methods

An interdisciplinary team representative of the IR and preprocedure/postprocedure care area (PPCA) health care personnel, managers, and data analysts was formed. A standardized form was used to document both inpatient and outpatient progress through the PPCA and IR workflow in six rooms and to document reasons for delays. Data generated were used to identify key problems areas, implement improvement interventions, and monitor their effects. Project duration was 6 months.

## Results

The average number of on-time starts for the first case of the day increased from 23% to 56% ( _P_ value < .01). The average number of on-time, scheduled outpatients increased from 30% to 45% ( _P_ value < .01). Patient wait time to arrive at treatment room once they were ready for their procedure was reduced on average by 10 minutes ( _P_ value < .01). Patient care delay duration per 100 patients was reduced from 30.3 to 21.6 hours (29% reduction). Number of patient care delays per 100 patients was reduced from 46.6 to 40.1 (17% reduction). Top reasons for delay included waiting for consent (26% of delays duration) and laboratory tests (12%).

## Conclusions

Many complex factors contribute to procedure start time delays within an IR practice. A data-driven and patient-centered, interdisciplinary team approach was effective in reducing delays in IR.

The focus on quality in radiology is expanding rapidly and includes quality control of equipment, quality assurance (QA) of our imaging and processes, and increasingly, continuous quality improvement (CQI or, in short, QI) . To perform QI, every step in a workflow process is mapped, measured, and analyzed with the goal of improving a process and reducing systems errors . Methods and principles of systems engineering have been widely recommended as a means to improve health care delivery, from staff planning and resource capacity allocation, to improving patient flow and reducing wait times and delays . Medical literature on the improvement of on-time starts and delay reduction is widely available but mostly limited to the hospital's surgical department setting .

The Radiology Department implemented a quality strategic plan with the following goals: 1) to foster a culture of quality, 2) to enhance patient satisfaction, 3) to promote standardization of workflow processes, and 4) to improve clinical quality and safety outcomes. Multiple projects were initiated to achieve these four goals. For instance, each of the 11 divisions within the department assigned a radiologist as quality officer to led efforts to monitor QA metrics and to develop practice quality improvement projects appropriate for their division. Next, we describe the creation and work of a QI project team in the interventional radiology (IR) and neurointerventional (NIR) divisions (together called “IR”) that resulted from this strategic plan with the following objectives: 1) to improve on-time procedure start times and 2) to reduce delays in patient care (and thereby improve patient satisfaction). The purpose of this article was to describe the process of building the QI team, collecting and analyzing the data, selecting QI interventions, and evaluating for improvement changes.

N is the number of cases. The median, mean, and SD are given in minutes. Both the mean and median were reported to demonstrate the data skew. Note that many of the mean times were significantly reduced as shown by the _P_ values in the Table. The _P_ values in bold indicate significance of at least 6%.


The “wait at reception” time is given for outpatients who did not require anesthesia; therefore, there were fewer cases in this time block. Similarly, “at PPCA” and “wait for room” times are given for patients (inpatients or outpatients) who did not require anesthesia. The _P_ values were calculated using the _t_ -test of the means before and after improvement interventions.
