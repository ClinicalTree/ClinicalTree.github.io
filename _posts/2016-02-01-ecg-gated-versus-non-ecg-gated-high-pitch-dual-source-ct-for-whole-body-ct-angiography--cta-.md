## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate motion artifacts, image quality, and practical differences in electrocardiographic (ECG)-gated versus non-ECG-gated high-pitch dual-source computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the whole aorta.

## Materials and Methods

Two groups, each including 40 patients, underwent either ECG-gated or non-ECG-gated high-pitch dual-source CTA of the whole aorta. The aortic annulus, aortic valve, coronary ostia, and the presence of motion artifacts of the thoracic aorta as well as vascular contrast down to the femoral arteries were independently assessed by two readers. Additional objective parameters including image noise and signal-to-noise ratio were analyzed.

## Results

Subjective and objective scoring revealed no presence of motional artifacts regardless of whether the ECG-gated or the non-ECG-gated protocol was used ( _P_ > 0.1). Image acquisition parameters (examination length, examination duration, radiation dose) were comparable between the two groups without significant differences. The aortic annulus, aortic valve, and coronary ostia were reliably evaluable in all patients. Vascular contrast was rated excellent in both groups.

## Conclusions

High-pitch dual-source CTA of the whole aorta is a robust and dose-efficient examination strategy for the evaluation of aortic pathologies whether or not ECG gating is used.

## Introduction

Various improvements in computed tomography (CT) technology are currently commonly used such as wide-detector, single-source, or dual-source systems, and have led to shorter image acquisition durations and less motion artifacts. With the introduction of the latest dual-source CT devices, CT angiography (CTA) of the aorta is feasible in seconds (e.g., a whole body aorta examination within 3 seconds) . Faster image acquisition has become possible because dual-source CT allows pitch values of up to 3.4 with or without electrocardiographic (ECG) synchronization . Other factors influencing image acquisition are the use of fast gantry rotation times, fast table movement, and wide detector systems. One major advantage of high-pitch dual-source CT imaging is its ability to virtually freeze motion for the evaluation of the thoracic aorta, as heart motion can lead to diagnostic difficulties .

Previous studies have been conducted on bolus timing in high-pitch dual-source CT, and there have been feasibilities comparing high-pitch CT to single-source CT techniques . Many of these studies showed advantages such as fast image acquisition, motionless imaging of the thoracic vessels, and the possibility of evaluating the coronary arteries without ECG gating .
