## Rationale and Objectives

In patients with severe emphysema and poor quality of life, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) may be considered and guided based on lobar emphysema severity. In particular, x-ray computed tomography (CT) emphysema measurements are used to identify the most diseased and the second–most diseased lobes as BLVR targets. Inhaled gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) also provides chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) biomarkers of lobar emphysema and ventilation abnormalities. Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate CT and MRI biomarkers of lobar emphysema and ventilation in patients with COPD eligible for BLVR. We hypothesized that MRI would provide complementary biomarkers of emphysema and ventilation that help determine the most appropriate lung lobar targets for BLVR in patients with COPD.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 22 BLVR-eligible patients from the Thoracic Imaging Network of Canada cohort (diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide = 37 ± 12%  predicted , forced expiratory volume in 1 second = 34 ± 7%  predicted , total lung capacity = 131 ± 17%  predicted , and residual volume = 216 ± 36%  predicted ). Lobar CT emphysema, measured using a relative area of <−950 Hounsfield units (RA  950 ) and MRI ventilation defect percent, was independently used to rank lung lobe disease severity.

## Results

In 7 of 22 patients, there were different CT and MRI predictions of the most diseased lobe. In some patients, there were large ventilation defects in lobes not targeted by CT, indicative of a poorly ventilated lung. CT and MRI classification of the most diseased and the second–most diseased lobes showed a fair-to-moderate intermethod reliability (Cohen κ = 0.40–0.59).

## Conclusions

In this proof-of-concept retrospective analysis, quantitative MRI ventilation and CT emphysema measurements provided different BLVR targets in over 30% of the patients. The presence of large MRI ventilation defects in lobes next to CT-targeted lobes might also change the decision to proceed or to guide BLVR to a different lobar target.

## Introduction

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a chronic airflow limitation associated with airway inflammation due to long-term exposure to inhaled toxins and particles . In patients with COPD, emphysematous tissue destruction and narrowing of the small airways contribute to airflow limitation , lung hyperinflation, dyspnea, and worsening quality of life . Emphysema is inexorably progressive and irreversible, whereas lung hyperinflation also worsens over time and leads to worsening lung compliance, loss of exercise capacity, increased frequency of exacerbations, and a significant decline in quality of life . To improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with very severe COPD and extensive emphysema, lung volume reduction techniques were developed to selectively reduce or remove emphysematous tissue .

The overarching goal of lung volume reduction methods is to improve lung function and to decrease hyperinflation, which together result in improved patient quality of life and functional status . Such surgical approaches, however, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality . However, in a specific subgroup of patients with heterogeneous upper lobe predominant emphysema and poor functional status, there were significant benefits , including modest improvements in quality of life . Since then, a number of minimally invasive bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) approaches have been developed with the goal of improving outcomes and diminished morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure. Several methods have been pioneered, including coils to collapse large airways , one-way endobronchial valves to promote passive collapse and deflation over time , and thermal vapor ablation to create an inflammatory response with subsequent scarring and loss of volume . Collateral ventilation is an important determinant of optimal BLVR outcomes , although recent studies showed that BLVR using vapor ablation may be successful regardless of interlobar or intralobar collateral ventilation . For all of these approaches, typically one or two severely diseased lobes are targeted with the aim of diverting blood flow and ventilation to remaining areas of healthier lung parenchymas .
