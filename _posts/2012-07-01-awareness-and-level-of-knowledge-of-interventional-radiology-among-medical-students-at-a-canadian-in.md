## Purpose

To assess the awareness and level of exposure of interventional radiology (IR) among medical students at a Canadian medical school. To understand how IR can be better described and introduced to medical students.

## Materials and Methods

Electronic anonymous surveys were sent to 542 medical students in their first, second, and third years at a Canadian 3-year medical school. A total of 103 students (19%) responded. Each survey contained 17 questions assessing knowledge, interest, and perception of IR.

## Results

Fifty-three percent (55/103) of respondents reported “poor” knowledge of IR and only 18% (19/103) said they would consider a career in IR. Respondents cited lack of knowledge (48%, 37/77) or lack of interest (43%, 33/77) as the main reasons why they would not consider IR as a career. Although 92% (95/103) of respondents could name at least one IR procedure, many (54%, 56/103) were unclear as to the duties of an interventional radiologist within the hospital. Seventy-four percent (76/103) of students stated that a mandatory 2-week rotation in radiology during clerkship would be beneficial, whereas 71% (73/103) stated that they would be interested in a 2-week IR selective during their mandatory core surgery rotation.

## Conclusions

The knowledge and exposure to IR in medical school is limited. Students were eager to learn more about IR and expressed a desire for more exposure. Early exposure of medical students to IR should be introduced to attract future interventional radiologists as well as increase awareness among future referring physicians.

With the continuing introduction of novel minimally invasive treatments, the field of interventional radiology (IR) is rapidly developing and expanding . However, as it continues to grow, it faces many challenges, including a worsening personnel shortage, turf issues with other specialties, limited funding, lack of referral support, and lack of awareness among other specialists, family physicians , and medical students . To address many of the issues faced by the field of IR, awareness among other practicing physicians as well as future physicians is vital .

The purpose of this study is to assess the awareness and level of knowledge of IR among medical students at a Canadian medical school. We also assess the methods of dissemination of this information in an attempt to understand how this rapidly expanding field can be better described and introduced to our future physicians. This could have important implications for the future of IR, both in attracting more talented medical students to the field and in increasing awareness among future referring physicians.
