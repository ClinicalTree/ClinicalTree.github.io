## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the ability of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to differentiate several tumor entities of the parotid gland in a prospective clinical trial.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 112 patients with parotid tumors were examined with dynamic contrast-enhanced 1.5 T MRI. Precontrast axial T1-weighted imaging was used to select five slices for the dynamic study. Subsequently, a T1-weighted FLASH sequence was used for the dynamic contrast study (0.2 ml Gd/kg × body weight). Contrast agent application and the FLASH sequence were started simultaneously. Ten acquisitions of 10 seconds’ scan time each were performed (total acquisition time 1:40 minutes). Signal intensity versus time (SIvT) curves was obtained for all tumors. After correlation of the categorized SIvT curves, these were compared with histopathology. Finally, all MRIs together with the tumor specific SIvT curves were re-read and correlated with histopathologic diagnosis. All reading sessions were done by three experienced radiologists.

## Results

Four characteristic intensity-time curves were observed: pleomorphic adenoma showed a gradual increase in signal intensity, followed by a plateau phase on a low intensity level. Cysts showed a vacillating course at a low signal intensity level. Adenolymphomas as well as carcinomas showed a rapid increase in signal intensity followed by a plateau phase. Statistic significance was found for the time-to-peak values for adenolymphomas and pleomorphic adenomas and for the maximum peak signal intensity values for carcinomas. Together with other morphologic MRI criteria (contrast enhancement, border characteristics) and clinical features, a differentiation between adenolymphoma and carcinoma was possible.

## Conclusions

With additional dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, a more reliable differentiation between common parotid tumors is possible before surgery.

Salivary gland neoplasms account for about 0.5%–3% of all malignant tumors ( ), and most individuals suffer from some illness related to the salivary glands once in their lifetime—infectious as well as neoplastic or part of a systemic disease, acute or chronic ( ). Determining whether a parotid mass is benign or malignant is very important because it strongly influences therapy: if a tumor is benign, only partial or even extracapsular dissection might be indicated, whereas total or even radical parotidectomy including facial nerve resection is necessary whenever a malignant lesion is suspected.

The diagnostic strategy is a multimodal approach. The most inexpensive and well-established diagnostic tool after physical examination is ultrasound ( ). High sensitivities up to 100% are reported in literature for tumors arising in the superficial lobe of the parotid gland ( ). Ultrasound proved to be very suitable to differentiate between intra- versus extraglandular lesions. For tumors located in deeper parts of the gland, cross-sectional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are necessary ( ). Since the 1980s, CT has become increasingly useful for demonstrating tumors of the salivary glands and their extent as well as differentiating tumors of the salivary glands from extrinsic lesions ( ). The limitations of CT, such as radiation and use of iodinated contrast agents with relatively high rate of side effects, encourage the use of MRI as the standard imaging modality for salivary gland tumors. The possibility of direct multiplanar imaging, excellent tissue contrast with better evaluation of the interfaces between muscle and tumor (which exhibit very similar density values in CT), and better differentiation of intrinsic versus extrinsic masses have made MRI the imaging modality of choice ( ). It has been shown that MRI studies are superior in detecting and determining the extent of disease in the setting of suspected salivary gland mass ( ). Most of these studies were done with 0.5 T magnets. The use of 1.5 T magnets improves image quality, because shorter acquisition times allow dynamic MRI studies that add precious information regarding tumor vascularization, perfusion, contrast uptake, and washout ( ). Yet it can be difficult to determine the tumor entity with conventional MRI studies.
