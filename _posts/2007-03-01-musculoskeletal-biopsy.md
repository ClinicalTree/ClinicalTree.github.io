## Rationale and Objectives

Physicians from many specialties perform musculoskeletal biopsy. Using the Medicare database, we sought to determine which specialties represent the physicians who are performing the majority.

## Materials and Methods

Using the CMS physician supplier procedure summary master file for 1996–2003, we extracted all claims for biopsy procedure codes (including marrow aspiration, muscle biopsy, percutaneous bone biopsy, and open surgical biopsy) categorized by provider specialty, and we analyzed procedure volumes.

## Results

Since 1996, the rate of utilization of percutaneous bone biopsy has remained stable. In 2003, marrow aspiration was most commonly performed by hematology/oncology (80,038, 57%), followed by medical oncology (23,428, 17%); radiologists performed 755 (0.5%). Muscle biopsies were predominantly performed by radiologists (4,761, 40%), followed by neurosurgery (591, 5%). Percutaneous bone biopsy was mostly performed by radiologists (14,830, 53%), but orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and hematology/oncology specialists performed a large minority (6,879, 2,296, and 1,048 respectively; in aggregate, 37%). From 1996 to 2003, radiologists performed 71% more muscle biopsies (2,788 to 4,761) and 60% more percutaneous bone biopsies (9,259 to 14,830). Although most specialties are performing fewer percutaneous bone biopsies (e.g., oncologists: 7,217 to 1,048, −85%), orthopedic surgeons are performing 247% more (1,983 to 6,879) and neurosurgeons are performing 2,343% more (94 to 2,296).

## Conclusion

Excluding marrow aspiration, radiologists perform the majority of percutaneous bone biopsies, and the volume is increasing in the U.S. Medicare population. The overall volume has remained relatively stable from 1996 to 2003; although medical specialties are performing fewer, the volume performed by surgeons is increasing rapidly.

Musculoskeletal biopsy is frequently performed to assess bone marrow pathology and to diagnose bone and soft tissue tumors, and it is also commonly used for the evaluation of suspected musculoskeletal infection. Correct diagnosis using the safest and most minimally invasive technique is what most clinicians hope to achieve when referring patients for musculoskeletal biopsy. The most suitable type of biopsy procedure for musculoskeletal lesions has been controversial ( ). Open surgical biopsy has the advantage that a large amount of the specimen can be sampled. Open biopsy can be associated with complications such as hematoma, infection, and tumor dissemination into the surgical bed. When compared to open biopsy percutaneous, musculoskeletal biopsy is associated with fewer complications ( ) and is more cost effective ( ). A variety of image guidance techniques are used to perform musculoskeletal biopsy, including fluoroscopy, ultrasound, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging ( ). Some biopsy procedures are routinely performed by nonradiologists without image guidance (e.g., marrow aspiration from the posterior iliac bone, often performed by hematologists and oncologists). Today, physicians from many specialties perform musculoskeletal biopsy. Using the Medicare database, we sought to determine which specialties are performing the majority of these biopsies and to assess any trends in practice over time.

## Materials and methods

Data were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Physician/Supplier Procedure Summary Master Files for 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003. These files are aggregates of all Medicare Part B billing claims for services performed nationwide by physicians for beneficiaries enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. The files classify each physician service by type of procedure, using CPT-4 codes, and by specialty of the physician provider, using one of 107 CMS specialty codes. The database includes both inpatient and outpatient procedures. Use of this database, which contains no patient identifiers, is exempt from institutional review board review.
