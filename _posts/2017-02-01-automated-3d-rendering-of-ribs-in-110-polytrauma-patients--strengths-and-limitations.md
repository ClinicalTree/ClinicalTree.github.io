## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the strengths and limitations of a rib-unfolding software in a polytrauma context.

## Materials and Methods

Chest computed tomography (CT) examinations of 110 patients were reviewed for specific detection of rib fractures using: (1) transverse CT sections ±  multiplanar reformattings (ie, the standard of reference), and (2) unfolded rib images reconstructed by the CT Bone Reading software with the possibility of rib analysis along their long axis and creation of standard orthogonal views in different orientations of any area suspected of fracture.

## Results

The software provided complete reconstruction of the whole rib cage in 94 patients (85.5%) and partially incomplete reconstruction in 16 patients (14.5%). The percentage of ribs inadequately reconstructed was 1.5% (40 of 2640 ribs), mainly related to unfused epiphyses (13 of 40), costal hypoplasia (8 of 40), and vertebral fracture (6 of 40). The sensitivity and specificity in detecting rib fractures at a per-patient, per-rib, and per-costal arc level ranged from 0.73 to 0.84 and 0.99 to 1, respectively. At a costal arc level, the reader's misinterpretations accounted for 67% (4 of 6) of false-positive and 24% (20/84) of false-negative results, and interpretive difficulties were encountered for single-cortex fractures or fractures at the extremities of the costal shaft.

## Conclusions

An accurate diagnosis of rib fracture was achieved with the reading of unfolded rib images. In a polytrauma context, the evaluated system could facilitate rib analysis.

## Introduction

Whereas computed tomography (CT) is a useful method for detecting pathological changes involving the ribs and adjacent structures, counting the ribs and thus, precisely localizing lesions, has always been considered as a time-consuming task on CT examinations, especially in the context of multiple fractures on adjacent ribs. Several methods have successively been proposed to overcome these difficulties, based on the recognition of anatomic landmarks. In the early 1990s, identification of the medial clavicle and the sternal angle on sequential CT examinations allowed easy recognition of the first rib and second costal cartilage, respectively, from which sequential counting of the other ribs could be undertaken. However, counting from the sternoclavicular joint is tedious for mid and lower rib lesions, and this method is not applicable for counting ribs on abdominal CT studies that do not have images of the entire rib cage. Another approach was then proposed by Kim et al. with a reference point at the xiphoid process . Owing to the presence of numerous anatomic variations in the attachments of costal cartilages to the proximal xiphoid, this method did not improve correct localization of rib lesions on abdominal CT . The introduction of volumetric CT scanning dramatically modified the detection of rib fractures as multiplanar reformatting (MPR) and volume rendering (VR) on whole-body acquisitions became accessible in the context of polytrauma . In the emergency setting, Alkhadi et al. demonstrated that VR had a high accuracy and was considerably faster than transverse imaging . However, these authors pointed out some limitations and possible pitfalls of VR that could hamper detection of subtle or undisplaced rib fractures.

In this context, great interest has recently been directed toward analysis of ribs on virtually rendered unfolded views of the ribs that provide automated recognition and numbering of right and left ribs. Applied to the reading of chest CT examinations in the context of blunt trauma and multiple myeloma before and after treatment , this software was found to improve the detection of rib fractures and osteolyses, respectively, with significantly reduced reading times compared to conventional standard multiplanar reformats. However, these investigations included the possibility of manual editing prior to the automated segmentation step or use of correction tools when the automatically assigned image set was considered diagnostically insufficient . In the specific context of polytrauma patients, Ringl et al. reported the need for user's intervention in 38.6% of the examined patients . Although it was subsequently followed by successful rib segmentation in the majority of cases, the authors did not provide information on the causes of incomplete or incorrect rib segmentation after the initial postprocessing procedure. Moreover, they reported false-positive diagnoses of fractures in 6–12% of patients but they did not describe the reasons for these erroneous interpretations. Because precise knowledge of the strengths and limitations of a new tool is an important prerequisite prior to its clinical implementation, we undertook the present study to test the results achievable with the unfolding rib program applied without any user's intervention. In a population of trauma patients, our goals were to assess the radiologist's rate of detection of rib fractures and to describe the causes of software errors to optimize its utilization. No attempt was made to investigate its role as a complement or substitute to the traditional method of rib fracture assessment.
