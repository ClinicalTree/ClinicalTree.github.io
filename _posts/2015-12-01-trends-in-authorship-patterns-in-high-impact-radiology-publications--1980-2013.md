## Rationale and Objectives

Concerns have been raised about authorship inflation in medical literature. The purpose of this study was to determine how the number of authors per radiology article has changed over time with regard to study type and geographic factors.

## Materials and Methods

We collected data on study type, authorship count, and the country of the corresponding author for a sample of articles published in Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, and European Radiology in 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2013. Only original research and review articles were considered. We computed trends in the mean number of authors per article for each journal and compared authorship trends between study types and geographic region. The study did not involve human subjects and was therefore exempt from institutional board review at our institution.

## Results

A total of 682 articles were reviewed, of which 572 were original research articles (83.9%) and 110 review articles (16.1%). The overall number of authors per article doubled from 3.6 in 1980 to 7.3 in 2013 ( _P_ < .001). From 1990 to 2013, the largest absolute increase in authorship count was in Radiology (4.4–8.1, 84.1%, _P_ < .001). The largest increase in authorship occurred in original research articles (3.7–7.8, 111%, _P_ < .001). Although authorship counts were greatest in Asia over most study period, growth in authorship count was highest in Europe.

## Conclusions

Authorship count has dramatically increased in radiology journals in the last 3 decades, particularly in original research articles and in Europe.

Despite multiple attempts to create and revise authorship guidelines for scientific literature, the perception of honorary authorship remains high in radiology. Honorary authorship has been defined as the intentional assignment of authorship to an individual who did not meet the criteria for authorship as established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) . Eisenberg et al surveyed 392 first authors of all original research articles in Radiology and European Radiology from 2006 to 2009 and found that 102 (26.0%) thought that one or more coauthors did not make enough of a contribution to deserve being included as an author .

Several attempts have been made to limit inappropriate authorship in the scientific literature. In 1985, the ICMJE established its first criteria for authorship . The most recent version was released in 2013 and renamed “Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals.” The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following criteria: 1) substantial contribution to conception, acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the article; 2) drafting the article or critically revising it for important intellectual content; 3) providing final approval of the version to be published; and 4) agreeing to be accountable for all aspects of the work and ensuring that any questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the article are investigated and resolved. Authors must meet all four criteria, whereas those who contribute to the article but do not meet all criteria should be acknowledged .
