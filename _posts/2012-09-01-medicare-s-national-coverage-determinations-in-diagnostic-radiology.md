## Objective

To systematically review and summarize the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) national coverage determination (NCDs) pertaining diagnostic imaging technologies from 1999 through 2010.

## Methods

All NCDs pertaining to diagnostic imaging were identified from the Tufts Medical Center NCD database. The variables under study included the quality of the clinical evidence and the final coverage determination. The types of restrictions were categorized. We also categorized the final decisions as “positive coverage” or “no positive/no change in coverage” and assessed the correlation between positive coverage and other variables using Fisher exact test.

## Results

Twenty-two of 152 (15%) NCDs pertained to diagnostic imaging technologies. The supporting evidence was judge to be good, fair, and poor in 5, 6, and 11 cases, respectively. Eleven technologies (50%) were covered with conditions, four (18%) deferred the coverage decision to local level, and two (9%) were completely not covered. In five instances there was no change to the prior coverage status. Of the 11 decisions resulting in positive coverage, 8 (73%) restricted use to specific population subgroups, 5 (46%) applied restrictions related to treatment, 4 were covered with evidence development, and 2 were restricted to care in specific settings. A significantly higher rate of positive coverage decisions was achieved if the available evidence was good (100% 5/5) or fair (83% 5/6) compared to technologies with poor evidence (10% 1/10) ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusion

CMS has demonstrated a propensity to limit the use of advanced diagnostic imaging to scenarios in which appropriateness is supported by adequate evidence of clinical utility and improved outcomes with the quality of evidence being a significant factor on final decisions. Understanding the need for high-quality evidence and the types of limitations placed on coverage allows for appropriate planning for the incorporation of diagnostic imaging technologies into clinical practice.

Developments in medical imaging technology represent a surpassing diagnostic advancement in modern medicine. These advancements have been accompanied by increased utilization and substantial associated costs (eg, the estimated number of magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\] and computed tomography \[CT\] studies tripling over the past 10 years). This “imaging boom” raises myriad questions for patients, providers, and payers with respect to the appropriateness of the use of diagnostic imaging technology . Between 2000 and 2006, Medicare spending for imaging services more than doubled to an estimated $14 billion . Some evidence suggests that a portion of this spending was neither necessary nor appropriate . Based on that premise, the US Government Accountability Office recommended that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) implement additional management practices such as prior authorization and modifications to its payment methods in order to limit the growth . More recently, CMS established an imaging demonstration project to evaluate whether the implementation of clinical decision support systems increases the appropriateness of use of advanced imaging services for specific indications .

Medicare coverage decisions are guided by the legislation that created Medicare, which states that “Medicare coverage is limited to items and services that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury” . Fifteen regional Medicare administrative contractors make the majority of coverage decisions for medical interventions. However, for interventions deemed to have a significant impact on the Medicare program, CMS performs a national coverage determination (NCD) . CMS makes approximately 10–15 NCDs each year. In an NCD, CMS reviews the available evidence to determine if the intervention is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis of illness or injury for Medicare beneficiaries. As part of the NCD, CMS may commission a technology assessment or consult the Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (MEDCAC), an external advisory panel established to provide independent guidance and expert advice to CMS on specific clinical topics. The NCD process is transparent and includes opportunity for public participation. NCDs are publicly available via decision memoranda on the CMS website. Although on occasion CMS has cited cost-effectiveness evidence in decision memoranda, its stated position is that cost and cost-effectiveness evidence is not relevant to coverage . CMS rarely issues an absolute coverage decision; rather, coverage is typically restricted to patient subgroups or to particular clinical circumstances .
