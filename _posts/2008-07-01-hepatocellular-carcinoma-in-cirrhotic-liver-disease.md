## Rationale and Objectives

Our goal was to prospectively determine the value of perfusion computed tomography (CT) in the quantitative assessment of tumor-related angiogenesis in cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Materials and Methods

Forty-seven patients met all the following inclusion criteria: 1) Child-Pugh class A or B liver cirrhosis; 2) presence of a single lesion suspected as HCC at screening ultrasound examination; and 3) lesion diameter between 1 and 3 cm. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasound, pre- and post-contrast triple-phase CT, and perfusion computed tomographic study using multidetector 16-slice CT. Six parameters related to the blood microcirculation and tissue perfusion were measured for the focal liver lesion and cirrhotic parenchyma: perfusion (P), tissue blood volume (BV), hepatic perfusion index (HPI), arterial perfusion (AP), portal perfusion (PP), and time to peak (TTP). Perfusion parameters were described with quartile values of their distribution; univariate paired and unpaired Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used for statistical analysis.

## Results

HCC was diagnosed in 21 of the 47 patients; in the remaining 26, HCC was not found at contrast-enhanced ultrasound and multidetector 16-slice computed tomographic study. The values of perfusion parameters measured within tumor tissue were: P (ml/s/100 g): median = 47.0 (first quartile = 36.0, third quartile = 61.4); BV (ml/100 mg): median = 24.0 (first quartile = 18.7, third quartile = 29.3); HPI (%): median = 78.4 (first quartile = 62.9, third quartile = 100); AP (ml/min): median = 45.9 (first quartile = 39.0, third quartile = 60.1); PP (ml/min): median = 9.0 (first quartile = 0.0, third quartile = 24.5); and TTP (seconds): median = 18.7 (first quartile = 16.3, third quartile = 26.5). The corresponding values calculated in cirrhotic surrounding parenchyma were P (ml/s/100 g): median = 11.5 (first quartile = 9.4, third quartile = 13.9); BV (ml/100 mg): median = 10.7 (first quartile = 7.1, third quartile = 14.2); HPI (%): median = 10.6 (first quartile = 8.7, third quartile = 11.9); AP (ml/min): median = 13.2 (first quartile = 10.1, third quartile = 15.5); PP (ml/min) median = 55.2 (first quartile = 40.1, third quartile = 79.5); and TTP (seconds): median = 41.7 (first quartile = 38.9, third quartile = 44.6). P, BV, HPI, and AP values were higher ( _P_ < .001), whereas PP and TTP were lower ( _P_ < .001) in HCC relative to the surrounding liver. Values of perfusion parameters in the cirrhotic liver of patients with and without HCC were not significantly different ( _P_ \> .001).

## Conclusion

In cirrhotic patients with HCC, perfusion computed tomographic technique can provide quantitative information about tumor-related angiogenesis.

As many diseases induce early changes in tissue hemodynamic status, quantitative tissue perfusion imaging could have the ability to characterize pathologic states, establish a diagnosis, and map the response to treatment ( ). In patients with liver cirrhosis, a spectrum of focal lesions, including benign regenerative nodules, dysplastic nodules, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, develop; differences in their respective blood supplies can assist in their detection and characterization ( ). Although regenerative nodules receive the majority of blood supply from the portal vein, the evolution from a low-grade dysplastic nodule to frank HCC is associated with a progression toward increasing arterial blood supply, mainly due to tumor-related arterial neovascularization (angiogenesis) ( ). This is a complex process involving endothelial cell proliferation, capillary formation, coordinated remodeling of extracellular tumor stroma, and anastomosis with the pre-existing host vasculature ( ). Tumor angiogenesis may have important implications in the diagnosis and treatment of liver tumors; therefore, the development of clinically applicable techniques enabling its characterization and quantification would be important in the management of these neoplasms ( ). Functional computed tomography (CT) with perfusion imaging is a new application in which a quantitative map of tissue perfusion is created from dynamic computed tomographic data and displayed using a color scale, allowing quantification of perfusion in absolute units at high spatial resolution ( ). Several earlier studies reporting a correlation between contrast enhancement parameters and histologic measurements of angiogenesis have suggested the possible use of perfusion computed tomographic technique as a marker of tumor angiogenesis ( ).

The purpose of this study was to determine the value of functional CT with perfusion imaging in the quantitative assessment of tumor-related arterial angiogenesis in patients with cirrhotic liver disease and HCC, as determined by the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) criteria.
