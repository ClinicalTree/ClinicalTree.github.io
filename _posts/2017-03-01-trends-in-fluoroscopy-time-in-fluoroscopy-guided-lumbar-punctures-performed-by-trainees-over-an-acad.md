## Rationale and Objectives

Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is an operator-dependent procedure that can contribute to lifetime cumulative radiation dose. Benchmark fluoroscopic times (FTs) have been published for ranges of body mass index (BMI), but trends in FT in FGLPs performed by neuroradiology trainees during their training have not been studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the trends in FTs in FGLPs performed by neuroradiology fellows in an academic year.

## Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed FGLPs performed at our institution from July 2013 to June 2015 and determined the FT average and standard deviation of residents and non-neuroradiology fellows, neuroradiology fellows, and neuroradiology attendings. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate group differences in FT in operator groups and academic quarters and by patient age, BMI, and needle length. Linear and Poisson regression analyses were performed to directly examine the relationship between the number of FGLPs performed and FTs.

## Results

A total of 776 patients had successful FGLPs; 594 cases (77%) were performed by neuroradiology fellows ( _n_ = 14). The average FT and variance for neuroradiology fellows significantly decreased over the year ( _P_ = 0.004 and _P_ < 0.001) with an estimated decrease of 0.01 minute of FT per FGLP. BMI, long needle length, and age ≥65 years old significantly affected the average FT ( _P_ = 0.03, _P_ < 0.001, and _P_ < 0.001) and FT decreased in all of these subgroups in the academic year.

## Conclusions

FT in FGLP cases performed by neuroradiology fellows decreases during the year. Our data can be utilized by radiology training programs and practices as a benchmark to monitor individual operator FT.

## Introduction

Lumbar puncture (LP) is typically performed using anatomic landmarks ; however, in some patients these methods are unsuccessful and image guidance is required, perhaps due to large body habitus or significant lumbar spondylosis. Fluoroscopy-guided lumbar puncture (FGLP) is an effective alternative to bedside LP as it can visualize the bony structures and guide the operator to accurately place the needle in the spinal canal in real time .

The main disadvantage of FGLP is the use of ionizing radiation. Medical ionizing radiation exposure has increased in the general population over the years and has led to major improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases . Although these benefits are clear, their inappropriate use can lead to unnecessary or unintended radiation doses, potentially increasing the long-term risk of cancer that may be influenced by cumulative radiation exposure. Diagnostic fluoroscopic studies are typically low-exposure techniques ; however, FGLPs are operator dependent and do contribute to lifetime cumulative dose, such that the American College of Radiology recommends monitoring of fluoroscopic time (FT, an indirect marker for radiation dose) and comparison to benchmark figures .
