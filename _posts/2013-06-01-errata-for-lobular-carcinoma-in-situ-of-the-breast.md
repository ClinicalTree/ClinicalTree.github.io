Figure 1


A 62-year-old woman with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) presenting as calcifications on screening mammography. Patient underwent biopsies of calcifications in left breast at four separate sites and times yielding LCIS. Patient has been followed for 6 years since initial LCIS diagnosis without evidence of breast malignancy. **(a)** Magnification mammogram shows clustered coarse heterogeneous calcifications ( _arrow_ ). Stereotactic biopsy yielded pleomorphic LCIS, which was subsequently excised. **(b)** A 45-year-old woman with LCIS presenting as calcifications on screening mammography. Magnification mammogram shows clustered pleomorphic calcifications ( _arrow_ ). Stereotactic biopsy showed classic LCIS. Patient underwent excisional biopsy with final histological diagnosis of intermediate-grade LCIS. Patient has been followed for 2 years with no evidence of breast malignancy. **(c)** A 53-year-old woman with LCIS presenting as calcifications on diagnostic mammography. Mammography shows multiple groups of amorphous calcifications ( _arrows_ ). Patient underwent stereotactic biopsy of one group of calcifications followed by excisional biopsy of entire regional area of amorphous calcifications. Final histological diagnosis was low-grade LCIS. Patient is scheduled to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies. **(d)** Magnification mammography of same patient as in **(c)** shows amorphous calcifications.
