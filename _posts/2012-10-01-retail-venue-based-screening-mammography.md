## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to explore women's interest and preferences in undergoing screening mammography in a retail health care setting.

## Materials and Methods

Self-administered surveys were distributed to 400 mammography patients in May to June 2009. All of the women who were asked were eligible for screening (age >40 years, no abnormal mammographic findings in the recent past). Three hundred eighty-six screening-eligible women filled out and returned the self-administered survey.

## Results

The average respondent age was 57 years. Three hundred ten of the patients (80.3%) had college or postgraduate educations. Two hundred three (52.6%) reported annual incomes >$60,000. Two hundred forty-one respondents (62.4%) had been undergoing screening mammography for >10 years, while this was the first examination for eight patients (2%). More than half of the patients ( _n_ = 215 \[55.7%\]) affirmed their interest in undergoing annual screening mammography in a private area within a retail shopping facility. Most preferred a pharmacy (77%) over Wal-Mart or a grocery store. Appealing factors about a retail setting were proximity to home (90%), free parking (62%), and operating hours (48.8%).

## Conclusions

There is interest among women in undergoing screening mammography at retail health care clinics, preferably pharmacies. The provision of services at a convenient location can increase adherence to guidelines for screening mammography.

In the United States, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and is the second leading cause of female cancer mortality . Fortunately, since the early 1990s, US female breast cancer mortality rates and the lifetime risk for developing breast cancer have slowly decreased . Of the various factors that have contributed to reducing breast cancer mortality, screening mammography has played an important role. Large population studies have shown that regular screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality by between 14% and 63% . The large range is explained by the confounding mortality reduction caused by advances in treatment of screen-detected cancers .

The percentage of women aged >40 years who reported undergoing mammography in the previous 2 years in the United States increased from 39.1% in 1987 to 75.4% in 2010 . However, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, significant socioeconomic disparity in screening mammography rates persists. For example, women with less than a high school education, those without health insurance, and those with annual incomes <$15,000 were least likely to have undergone mammography . Of the various factors attributed to this disparity, out-of-pocket costs (such as those associated with travel, dependent care, parking, etc) convenience to mammographic services, and lack of awareness about the benefits of screening have been found to be the most important .
