The availability of the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) has revolutionized the practice of radiology in the past two decades and has shown to eventually increase productivity in radiology and medicine. PACS implementation and integration may bring along numerous unexpected issues, particularly in a large-scale enterprise. To achieve a successful PACS implementation, identifying the critical success and failure factors is essential. This article provides an overview of the process of implementing and integrating PACS in a comprehensive health system comprising an academic core hospital and numerous community hospitals. Important issues are addressed, touching all stages from planning to operation and training. The impact of an enterprise-wide radiology information system and PACS at the academic medical center (four specialty hospitals), in six additional community hospitals, and in all associated outpatient clinics as well as the implications on the productivity and efficiency of the entire enterprise are presented.

Since the emergence of a Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in the early 1980s, we have witnessed revolutionary changes in radiology practice. Early years mostly dealt with the definition of large scale PACS, establishment of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) and other standards, the development of some early key PACS-related technologies, and PACS implementation strategies. Concepts such as enterprise PACS, integrating the health care enterprise workflow profiles, and EMR (electronic medical records) with image distribution were developed later . In 1995 Bauman et al conducted a worldwide survey of 82 institutions to investigate the number of large-scale installations and found an increase from 13 to 23 within 15 months, and they concluded there was a strong trend toward filmless radiology throughout the world . At the time, Bauman et al defined large-scale PACS by four criteria: 1) daily active clinical operation; 2) covering at least three modalities; 3) including workstations inside and outside of the radiology department; and 4) performing more than 20,000 examinations annually . In 1996 Huang et al described various types of PACS designs and styles of implementation and illustrated the gradual transition in hospitals from closed architectures to open integrated systems comprising multiple advanced technology components linked through stable digital interfaces . Eventually, between 2000 and 2005, guidelines for PACS installation were developed to outline structure and optimize the implementation process . Since the original PACS environments, users have faced growing demands for increased and more complex integration with other hospital systems beginning with a radiology information system (RIS). The increasing demand for communication of radiology information then expanded to systems outside radiology and ultimately to clinical integration of PACS into a larger organizational body of live clinical systems including the Hospital Information System (HIS) and EMR, with emphasis on integration of images into the overall workflow and record . After the implementation and integration, there remains a sustained requirement for a systematic process to establish and maintain the functionality of the system with training specific to the needs of users. Ongoing training and continued train-the-trainer concepts are representative of areas needing meticulous attention before and after the PACS implementation .

After completion of a complex integrated PACS implementation with successful training, one will encounter changes to clinical care reflected in workflow, clinical productivity, and system efficiency. In the early 1990s, different financial models were defined to analyze and justify the cost-effectiveness of PACS ; however, subsequently and especially after large PACS installation, there are increasing demands to evaluate the financial implications of the implementation. The most important parameters that have been studied are: reducing the number of unread, retaken, and lost films; increasing productivity; and reducing turnaround time . In 2009 Ayal et al published a comprehensive article on the financial objective of integrating EMR with the RIS and PACS at their medical center . They analyzed the impact of enterprise information systems at a large-scale service organization reviewing measurements of financial revenues, operating lead times, clinical process lead time, and subjective satisfaction levels by radiology staff and physicians. These measurements showed that, for the subsequent 12 months after installation, these performance measures kept improving at the rate of 63% .

In this article, we offer a review of a PACS implementation and integration in a current large-scale health system enterprise across an integrated hospital delivery network. The components around an implementation including integration, testing and support are described, then specifics of our implementation are presented, and finally improvements in productivity and efficiency as well as challenges and problems encountered are detailed.

## Preparation for implementation

## Contract

In developing a PACS contract, it is essential to agree not only on the financial terms, but also agree to milestones and to specify each party’s responsibilities . First, a detailed discussion of work plans is needed so buyers and vendors can mutually target the expected dates of completion. Though every date may not be predetermined during negotiation, the overall length of time necessary must be noted with sufficient dates for standardized work plan templates to delineate tasks for each side (  Fig 1 ). Second, penalties for delayed installations, unscheduled downtime, and failure to achieve performance measures should be defined. Third, agreements should be obtained for vendor support on interfaces, integration, and maintenance with services including repairs or upgrades during the life of the contract is clearly defined and additional costs and fees are predetermined.
