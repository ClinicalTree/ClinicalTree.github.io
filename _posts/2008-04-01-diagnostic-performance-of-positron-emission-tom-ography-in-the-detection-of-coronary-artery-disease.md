## Rationale and Objectives

Although myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET), using either cyclotron-produced ammonia or generator-produced rubidium 82, has reported excellent diagnostic capabilities in the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in individual studies, the technique is not widely used in practice. This may be driven by cost and availability or by unawareness of performance. The purpose of our study was to conduct an evidence-based evaluation of PET in the diagnosis of CAD.

## Materials and Methods

We examined studies from January 1977 to July 2007 using MEDLINE and EMBASE. A study was included if it ( ) used PET as a diagnostic test for CAD and ( ) used catheter x-ray angiography as the reference standard (≥50% diameter stenosis). Analysis was performed on a subject and coronary territory level.

## Results

Nineteen studies (1442 patients) met the inclusion criteria. On a patient level, PET demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.92 (95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 0.90–0.94) and specificity of 0.85 (CI: 0.79–0.90), with a positive likelihood ratio (LR+) of 6.2 (CI: 3.3–11.8) and negative likelihood ratio (LR−) of 0.11 (CI: 0.08–0.14). On a coronary territory level (n = 1130), PET showed a sensitivity of 0.81 (CI: 0.77–0.84) and specificity of 0.87 (CI: 0.84–0.90), with an LR+ of 5.9 (CI: 4.5-7.9) and an LR− of 0.19 (CI: 0.09–0.38).

## Conclusion

PET demonstrates excellent diagnostic properties in the diagnosis of CAD, especially at the patient level. The capabilities appear superior to those reported in meta-analyses for perfusion imaging with Tl-201 and sestamibi, or anatomical imaging with coronary MDCT angiography or MRA. Given that previous studies have found PET to be cost-effective and the current findings of excellent sensitivity and specificity, the modality should be more widely considered as an initial test in the diagnosis of CAD.

Coronary artery disease (CAD), secondary to atherosclerosis, is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, underlying or contributing to approximately 650,000 deaths per year ( ). While catheter-based x-ray angiography evaluation of the coronary lumen is generally used as the clinical reference standard, the invasive procedure carries small but significant risks; thus, a potential noninvasive alternative would be valuable. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is one of the most common used diagnostic tests in the assessment of CAD and largely performed by thallium-201 or a technetium-99m perfusion tracer via single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET), which has several advantages over SPECT, including better spatial resolution, higher counting efficiencies, and excellent attenuation correction, resulting in single-center studies demonstrating robust sensitivity and specificity, is less commonly performed throughout the world. This is likely driven by the greater availability and lesser costs of SPECT, but lack of awareness regarding the diagnostic properties of PET in the diagnosis of CAD may also be a factor. Moreover, PET has become more prevalent and less expensive in the last decade, given its widespread use in oncological imaging. The purpose of our study was to provide an evidence-based evaluation of the clinical utility of PET for coronary artery disease; thus, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of all currently published studies comparing PET with catheter-based x-ray angiography as the gold standard.

## Methods

## Data Sources and Searches

MEDLINE and EMBASE for English and non-English literature published from January 1977 to July 2007 were searched evaluating for the presence of CAD in native or non-native coronary arteries by PET and catheter-based x-ray angiography in the same patients. The search included medical subject headings for _positron emission tomography, myocardial perfusion_ , and _coronary angiography_ with the exploded term _coronary artery disease._ Moreover, we evaluated bibliographies of retrieved articles, review articles, and textbooks. The retrieved studies were examined for potentially duplicate or overlapping data. Given that meeting abstracts provide insufficient information regarding their data and lack of finality regarding the results, they were excluded.
