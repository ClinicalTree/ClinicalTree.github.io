## Introduction

As a profession driven by technologic advancement, medicine was destined to embrace the Internet. Progressive growth in availability and speed has increased Internet utilization in research, practice, and education. This review focuses on the use of the World Wide Web (Web) for education by practicing physicians. Particularly in radiology, where workloads are increasing, the Web represents a readily available educational resource for physicians with limited time. However, survey data from 2005 revealed that traditional educational resources are preferred by radiologists for both information retrieval and continuing medical education (CME) ( ). Accordingly, we sought to evaluate patterns of internet utilization for information seeking and use of web-based resources for CME over time, in an attempt to delineate how Web-based educational programs can best serve physicians.

## Literature Search: Methods

A broad search of PubMed was performed using the words “physician” and “Internet” to include all English language publications between January 1, 1996, and July 1, 2006. This produced 1,359 publications; the title, abstract, or article text was reviewed to select only those studies that surveyed practicing physicians with respect to their Internet use for medical information seeking or medical education. A cutoff of at least 50 respondents was applied, and any study that represented subgroup analysis of a previous investigation was not considered separately ( _n_ = 3), to yield a total of 29 studies that fulfilled the criteria.

Cognizance of other pertinent publications that were not included in these results prompted additional searches using the following phrases in varying combinations: Internet, information seeking, World Wide Web, physician, radiology, education, medical education, continuing medical education, survey, questionnaire. In addition, a “related search” option was used with one model study, and any previous or subsequent pertinent survey data described in an identified study were retrieved. These methods produced an additional 14 studies. Added to this compilation were the data from two survey investigations performed by our computed tomography (CT) division in 2005 ( ) and 2006, which surveyed radiologists at CME courses ( ) and online, respectively. These most recent data come from an unpublished online survey posted on our Web site (  www.ctisus.com ) for 11 weeks between January and March 2006. A total of 212 radiology professionals participated, with responses from 58 radiologists referred to as “current data” throughout this review.

## Literature Search: Results

Information from 45 survey investigations was analyzed (  Fig 1 ). The data available in these studies include responses from more than 44,000 physicians worldwide ( , current data). An effort was made to include surveys only involving physicians; however, 7 of the 45 had some non-physician medical professionals respond in addition to physicians ( ). For the purposes of this review, “Internet use” is defined as use of the Web for medical information retrieval or education, or the use of e-mail to consult colleagues.

The earliest survey was conducted between 1995 and 1996 ( ). For each subsequent year from 1997 through 2003, multiple investigations were identified, as well as at least one from 2004 and 2005 (  Fig 1 ). Four investigations did not indicate the year of distribution. All surveys analyzed were designed to study physician internet use for medical information retrieval or education. However, a variety of distribution methods were used, and the populations sampled were diverse (  Fig 1 ).
