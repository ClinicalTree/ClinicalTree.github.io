## Rationale and Objectives

Studies have demonstrated a relationship between mammographic parenchymal texture and breast cancer risk. Although promising, texture analysis in mammograms is limited by tissue superposition. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a novel tomographic x-ray breast imaging modality that alleviates the effect of tissue superposition, offering superior parenchymal texture visualization compared to mammography. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential advantages of DBT parenchymal texture analysis for breast cancer risk estimation.

## Materials and Methods

DBT and digital mammographic (DM) images of 39 women were analyzed. Texture features, shown in previous studies with mammograms to correlate with cancer risk, were computed from the retroareolar breast region. The relative performances of the DBT and DM texture features were compared in correlating with two measures of breast cancer risk: (1) the Gail and Claus risk estimates and (2) mammographic breast density. Linear regression was performed to model the association between texture features and increasing levels of risk.

## Results

No significant correlation was detected between parenchymal texture and the Gail and Claus risk estimates. Significant correlations were observed between texture features and breast density. Overall, the DBT texture features demonstrated stronger correlations with breast percent density than DM features ( _P_ ≤ .05). When dividing the study population into groups of increasing breast percent density, the DBT texture features appeared to be more discriminative, having regression lines with overall lower _P_ values, steeper slopes, and higher _R_ 2 estimates.

## Conclusion

Although preliminary, the results of this study suggest that DBT parenchymal texture analysis could provide more accurate characterization of breast density patterns, which could ultimately improve breast cancer risk estimation.

The ability to estimate a woman's risk of developing breast cancer risk is becoming increasingly important in clinical practice. Breast cancer risk assessment is used as a criterion to form guidelines for offering customized screening recommendations , to tailor individual breast cancer treatments , and to form preventive strategies , especially for women associated with higher risk. Currently, breast cancer risk assessment is limited both by the existing epidemiologic risk estimation models and by the breast imaging methods that have been considered to date.

The current gold standards for breast cancer risk estimation, the Gail and Claus models , are multivariate statistical models based primarily on nonmodifiable demographic, clinical, and hereditary risk factors. With the exception of childbirth as a modifiable risk factor, the Gail model estimates the risk for breast cancer on the basis of factors such as age at menarche, first-degree relatives with breast cancer, and number of prior biopsies . The Claus model relies on the assumption that susceptibility to breast cancer is regulated primarily by a rare autosomal dominant allele and therefore estimates the risk for breast cancer only on the basis of familial history of breast cancer, including ages at onset of relatives affected by breast cancer . Evaluation of the Gail model has shown that despite its good calibration for population-based risk assessment, it has modest discriminatory accuracy at the individual level . Studies evaluating the accuracy of models that predict genetic susceptibility to breast cancer, including the Claus model, have shown that there is a potential to overestimate the expected number of women at high risk for genetic mutations . Considering also that individual risk can be reduced by interventions such as chemoprevention , the Gail and Claus models lack the desired flexibility to estimate adjustments to risk levels.

∗  The goal of this clinical trial was to develop an understanding of the relative performance of new-generation breast imaging modalities. Eligible participants included women at high risk (>25% Gail and Claus lifetime risk), women with recently detected abnormalities, and previous patients with breast cancer undergoing follow-up. All women were volunteers who provided written informed consent. From March 2002 to August 2007, a total of 886 women enrolled in the trial. Within the same day, the women were imaged with digital mammography, whole-breast ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and optical imaging. The individual imaging results were reviewed in a consensus meeting of expert radiologists to determine the relative performance of the breast imaging modalities; the associated clinical information for each woman, such as pathology, likelihood of malignancy, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System lesion characterization, was also recorded as part of the study. From August 2004 to August 2005, a prototype DBT system was operating under research investigation, and DBT was offered as an option to the women participating in the clinical trial. During this period, a total of 52 women agreed to also undergo DBT imaging.

where _g__max_ is the maximum gray-level value, and _C_ is the normalized co-occurrence matrix . To optimize the computation of the gray-level co-occurrence statistics, gray-level quantization was implemented . The co-occurrence frequencies were calculated symmetrically in the four directions around each pixel using a displacement vector, _d_ = ( _dx_ , _dy_ ), along _x_ and _y_ dimensions, where _dx_ = _dy_ = 1 pixel offset. The texture features calculated in each of these four directions were averaged to create a single measure that was used in our experiments.
