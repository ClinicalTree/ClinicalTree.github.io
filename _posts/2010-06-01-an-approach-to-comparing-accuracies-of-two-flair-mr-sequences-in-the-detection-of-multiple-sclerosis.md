## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to present a new methodology to compare accuracies of two imaging fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance sequences in detection of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain in the absence of ground truth, and to determine whether the two sequences, which differed only in echo time (TE), have the same accuracy.

## Materials and Methods

We acquired FLAIR images at TE  1 = 90 ms and TE  2 = 155 ms from 46 patients with MS (24–69 years old, mean 45.8, 15 males) and 11 healthy volunteers (23–54 years old, mean 37.1, 6 males). Seven experienced neuroradiologists segmented lesions manually on randomly presented corresponding TE  1 and TE  2 images. For every image pair, a “surrogate ground truth” for each TE was generated by applying probability thresholds, ranging from 0.3 to 0.5, to the weighted average of experts' segmentations. Jackknife alternative free-response receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare experts' performance on TE  1 and TE  2 images, using successively the TE  1 \- and TE  2 -based ground truths.

## Results

Supratentorially, there were significant differences in relative accuracy between the two sequences, ranging from 8.4% to 12.1%. In addition, we found a higher ratio of false positives to true positives for the TE  2 sequence using the TE  2 ground truth, compared to the TE  1 equivalent. Infratentorially, differences in the relative accuracy did not reach statistical significance.

## Conclusion

The presented methodology may be useful in assessing the value of new clinical imaging protocols or techniques in the context of replacing existing ones, when the absolute ground truth is not available, and in determining changes in disease progression in follow-up studies. Our results suggest that the sequence with shorter TE should be preferred because it generates relatively fewer false positives. The finding is consistent with results of previous computer simulation studies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a devastating neurological disease that is diagnosed primarily on the basis of a multiphasic pattern of clinical symptoms . Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial in supporting the diagnosis, monitoring the dynamics of the disease, and evaluating responses to treatments . Considerable variability remains across institutions, however, in selecting an optimal MRI technique to detect MS lesions . Instead, many techniques are used concurrently and in various combinations, including intermediate-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and pre-and post-contrast T1-weighted imaging, among others . Further, because of rapid development of MRI technology and limited effort on methodology for selecting the best technique, no universal, rigorously optimized MRI protocol exists.

A fundamental problem complicating any research study evaluating and comparing imaging methods is the lack of “ground truth” information that is necessary to determine their accuracy (ie, questions as to whether there are any “true” lesions present and where they are located have no absolute answers). Many investigators either use a panel of experts to establish a surrogate ground truth based on all images, or directly compare images to determine which technique is better. These methods are fallible, however, as even experts vary in their interpretation of the images. Direct comparison studies have a known bias, because experts tend to prefer imaging methods that produce more false positives . To avoid this bias, images may be evaluated independently and in random order, but in the absence of “ground truth” data, such an approach may not be able to detect subtle differences in diagnostic accuracy.
