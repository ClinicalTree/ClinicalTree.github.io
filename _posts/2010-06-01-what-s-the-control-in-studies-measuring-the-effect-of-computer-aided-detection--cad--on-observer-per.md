## Rationale and Objectives

The goal of many multiple-observer computer-aided detection (CADe) studies is to estimate the change in observers' diagnostic performance with CADe from their unaided performance. A key issue in these studies is the method for estimating the observers' unaided performance. The crossover design is considered the most valid. The sequential design takes less time and is less expensive but may be biased. We conducted a study to investigate the differences between these two designs.

## Materials and Methods

Data from two large CADe studies using both types of unaided reads were analyzed. The first study involved three radiologists examining the chest x-rays of 200 patients for lung nodules. The second study involved 19 observers interpreting the computed tomography colonography images of 100 patients for polyps. Observers' sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic areas were estimated while unaided in both designs and compared to their accuracy with CADe. Bias, inter-observer variability, and correlations between unaided and aided results were assessed.

## Results

Observers tend to perform better while unaided in the sequential design than while unaided in the crossover design, but the differences are small. The inter-observer variability is larger in the sequential design. The correlations between unaided and aided results are larger in the sequential design. 95% CIs for the change with CADe are narrower with the sequential design.

## Conclusion

The estimated effect of CADe on observer performance is similar regardless of the study design. Use of the sequential design may save investigators time and resources.

Observer studies comparing the diagnostic performance without and with the use of computer-aided detection (CADe) are critical in verifying the clinical utility of CADe even if excellent stand-alone performance is proven . Numerous observer studies have been published in which CADe is used to help detect lesions in various clinical settings: breast lesions on mammography, lung nodules on plain films, pulmonary emboli on computed tomography (CT), and colonic polyps on CT colonography .

A key issue in the design of these CADe studies is the method for estimating the observers' performance without CADe (ie, unaided performance). There are three study design methods that have been used in prior studies: historical control, crossover control, and sequential control (  Fig 1 ).

Reference standard An expert observer reviewed the CT and/or PET images, and pathology results if available. Based on this review, the expert established ground truth about the presence or absence of actionable nodules, and determined the size, shape, and location (specified as one of 10 predefined lung regions) of all actionable nodules. The expert was not blinded to the original CT or PET interpretations but was blinded to the CADe marks. Two expert observers independently reviewed the optical colonoscopy and CTC images. When the experts did not agree, a third expert reviewed the images. This process was used to establish ground truth about the presence or absence of actionable polyps and the size, morphology, and spatial coordinates of all actionable polyps. The experts were not blinded to the original CTC or optical colonoscopy interpretations, but were blinded to the CADe marks.

CT, computed tomography; CADe, computer-aided detection; CTC, CT colonography; PET, positron emission tomography.
