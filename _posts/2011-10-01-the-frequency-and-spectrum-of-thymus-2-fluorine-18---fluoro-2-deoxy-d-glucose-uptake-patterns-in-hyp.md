## Rationale and Objectives

Thymic hyperplasia is associated with hyperthyroidism. Increased thymus 2-\[fluorine-18\]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in hyperthyroidism patients has been reported. The aim of this study was to analyze the FDG positron emission tomography (PET) thymus uptake spectrum in patients with active hyperthyroidism with correlation with serum hormones.

## Materials and Methods

The prospective study included FDG PET scans from 65 hyperthyroidism patients and 30 subjects with euthyroid status as control group. The intensity of FDG uptake in thyroid and thymus regions was graded subjectively on a five-point scale and semi-quantitatively by measuring standard uptake value (SUV). Correlation coefficient between thymus SUV and serum thyroxine, triiodothyronine, thyrotropin, thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO Ab), thyrotropin receptor autoantibody (TR Ab), and thymulin were analyzed.

## Results

Among 65 hyperthyroidism patients, 30 (46.2%) and 39 (60%) patients showed thyroid and thymus FDG uptake, respectively. The frequency of thymus uptake FDG was high in patients younger than age 40 (28/31, 90.3%). The patterns of the thymic FDG uptake include inverted V or triangular, separated triangular, united nontriangular, unilateral right or left extension, and focal midline. Focal midline FDG uptake was the most common pattern (15/39, 38.5%). None of the control group showed thymus FDG uptake. The correlation coefficient between the FDG uptake SUV levels in thymus and serum hormones, thyrotropin, TPO Ab, TR Ab, and thymulin levels were all low ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusions

In FDG PET scan, thymus activity was common in hyperthyroidism patients; this should not be misdiagnosed as a malignancy in patients exhibiting weight loss.

It has been reported that thymic hyperplasia is associated with Graves’ disease . In most cases, thymic hypertrophy is minimal and unapparent. Therefore, radiologically detectable thymic enlargement as an anterior mediastinal mass with thyrotoxicosis has not been frequently reported . The thymic hyperplasia resolution with the reversibility of the hyperthyroid state has been reported by measuring the size of thymus on x-ray computed tomography (CT) .

It has been reported that classic symptoms and signs of hyperthyroidism are significantly less prevalent in older patients . The only three signs found in more than 50% of older patients with hyperthyroidism were tachycardia, weight loss, and fatigue . The latter two signs may raise the suspicious of undiagnosed malignancy in elderly patients. If hyperthyroidism is highly suspected, thyroid function test should be performed first to search the underlying disease.
