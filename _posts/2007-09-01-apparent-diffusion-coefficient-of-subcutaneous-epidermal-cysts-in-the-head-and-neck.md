## Rationale and Objectives

Subcutaneous epidermal cysts and intracranial epidermoid cysts are pathologically identical. Although diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) studies of intracranial epidermoid cysts have been numerously reported, those of subcutaneous epidermal cysts have not been sufficiently investigated. Our hypothesis for this study is that the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of subcutaneous epidermal cysts and intracranial epidermoid cysts are not different. This study was intended to evaluate the ADC of subcutaneous epidermal cysts of the head and neck in comparison with that of intracranial epidermoid cysts.

## Materials and Methods

The MR studies were performed in 14 patients with head and neck subcutaneous epidermal cysts and 10 patients with intracranial epidermoid cysts using line scan DWI (LSDWI). The ADC was measured and compared between the two types of cyst.

## Results

The ADC values (mean ± SD) were 0.81 ± 0.14 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s in subcutaneous epidermal cysts and 1.06 ± 0.12 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s in intracranial epidermoid cysts. A significant difference was found in ADC values between the two types ( _P_ = .0019).

## Conclusion

Our preliminary study has shown that the ADC provides useful information regarding tissue characterization of subcutaneous epidermal cysts. However, the ADC of subcutaneous epidermal cysts was significantly lower than that of intracranial epidermoid cysts.

Epidermal cysts are common, benign masses that occur in the skin. The lesions commonly involve the scalp, face, neck, trunk, and back ( ). However, only a few reports regarding MR imaging findings have been issued on subcutaneous epidermal cysts ( ). Typical MR imaging findings of subcutaneous epidermal cysts include a well-circumscribed margin, iso-, or slightly high signal intensity relative to adjacent muscles on T1-weighted images, and very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images ( ). Usually, no apparent enhancement is visible inside the cyst if unruptured ( ).

Subcutaneous epidermal cysts and intracranial epidermoid cysts are pathologically identical: cysts filled with keratin debris and bounded by a wall of the stratified squamous epithelium ( ). Unlike subcutaneous epidermal cysts, numerous MR imaging reports have described intracranial epidermoid cysts ( ). Several studies of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) have had particular impact on the diagnosis of the intracranial epidermoid cysts ( ). However, reports on DWI and ADC of subcutaneous epidermal cysts are insufficient. We hypothesize that ADC values of subcutaneous epidermal cysts and intracranial epidermoid cysts are not different because they are pathologically identical. This study was intended to evaluate the ADC of subcutaneous epidermal cysts of the head and neck in comparison with that of intracranial epidermoid cysts.
