## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to systematically review the quality of papers on the clinimetric properties of magnetic resonance imaging for the diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in peripheral joints.

## Materials and Methods

A review of Medline, EMBASE, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and the Cochrane Library was performed by using a systematic search strategy. Two independent reviewers evaluated selected articles by using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tools. Items were reported independently for STARD and QUADAS.

## Results

Eighteen studies (validity, _n_ = 18; reliability, _n_ = 3; responsiveness, _n_ = 3) were included. Their overall quality of reporting of methods was fair. Methodological problems with the STARD system included a lack of reporting of exclusion criteria ( _n_ = 14), partial or no information on operators' expertise ( _n_ = 14) or blinding ( _n_ = 18), and deficient information on study time frames ( _n_ = 12), treatments ( _n_ = 10), or indeterminate results ( _n_ = 18). The distribution of QUADAS scores was heterogeneous, with overall scores ranging between 3.5 (poor) and 16.5 (excellent) (maximum score, 17.5).

## Conclusions

The quality of reporting of methods in studies on the magnetic resonance imaging assessment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is heterogeneous and fair overall. Further methodological refinement of research design should be sought in future studies to provide stronger evidence for the value of novel techniques in clinical settings.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood, with six to 19.6 incident cases per 100,000 children yearly in North America . Although the prognosis of this disease in children is generally favorable, with a majority of patients having no active synovitis in adulthood, persistent disease or progression of the disease is not uncommon, affecting children's growth and development .

Laboratory indices of synovial inflammation are measures that are easily quantifiable but fail to provide accurate information about functional joint outcomes in JIA . Radiographs are usually nonspecific in the early stages of the disease, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging tool for the detection of synovial hypertrophy and cartilage degeneration, which can be evaluated only indirectly by plain radiography .
