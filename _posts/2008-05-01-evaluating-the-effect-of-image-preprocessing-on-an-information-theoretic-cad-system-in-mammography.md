## Rationale and Objectives

In our earlier studies, we reported an evidence-based computer-assisted decision (CAD) system for location-specific interrogation of mammograms. A content-based image retrieval framework with information theoretic (IT) similarity measures serves as the foundation for this system. Specifically, the normalized mutual information (NMI) was shown to be the most effective similarity measure for reduction of false-positive marks generated by other prescreening mass detection schemes. The objective of this work was to investigate the importance of image filtering as a possible preprocessing step in our IT-CAD system.

## Materials and Methods

Different filters were applied, each one aiming to compensate for known limitations of the NMI similarity measure. The study was based on a region-of-interest database that included true masses and false-positive regions from digitized mammograms.

## Results

Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed that IT-CAD is affected slightly by image filtering. Modest, yet statistically significant, performance gain was observed with median filtering (overall ROC area index A  z improved from 0.78 to 0.82). However, Gabor filtering improved performance for the high-sensitivity portion of the ROC curve where a typical false-positive reduction scheme should operate (partial ROC area index  0.90 A  z improved from 0.33 to 0.37). Fusion of IT-CAD decisions from different filtering schemes markedly improved performance (A  z = 0.90 and  0.90 A  z = 0.55). At 95% sensitivity, the system's specificity improved by 36.6%.

## Conclusions

Additional improvement in false-positive reduction can be achieved by incorporating image filtering as a preprocessing step in our IT-CAD system.

Despite advances in treatment, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in women ( ). The role of screening mammography in the battle against breast cancer is well established; women with malignancies detected at an early stage have a significantly better prognosis ( ). However, it is also recognized that the diagnostic interpretation of mammograms continues to be challenging for radiologists with a documented 20% false-negative rate ( ).

The clinical significance of early breast cancer diagnosis and the higher than desired false-negative rate of screening mammography have motivated the development of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for decision support. These systems typically involve a hierarchical approach, first applying elaborate image preprocessing steps to enhance suspicious structures in the image and then employing morphologic and textural analysis to better classify these structures between true abnormalities and false positives. Detailed reviews of image processing techniques for mammographic image analysis and related CADe systems can be found elsewhere ( ). In addition, several CADe systems are already available commercially for both screen film mammography and full-field digital mammography ( ). Although their true clinical impact is often debated ( ), the scientific community continues to work toward improving the diagnostic performance and clinical integration of CADe technology. Ongoing CADe research efforts focus mainly on the reduction of false-positive computer marks as well as improving the detection rate of breast masses.

where μ  0  is the frequency of a sinusoidal plane, θ is the orientation, and σ _x_ and σ _y_ are standard deviations (or spatial spread) of the two-dimensional Gaussian envelope ( ). An octave bandwidth of 1 was used in our study because past psychophysical studies have confirmed that an octave bandwidth of 1 is a reasonably good estimate of the human eye when tuned to a frequency ( ). Central frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 cycles/degree with orientations at 0°, 45°, 90°, and 135° were used in this study.
