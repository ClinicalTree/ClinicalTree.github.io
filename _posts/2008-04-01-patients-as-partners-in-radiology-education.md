## Rationale and Objectives

Effective communication is essential for high quality care, yet little is known about radiologists’ communication with patients, what constitutes “best communication practices,” and how best to teach and evaluate it. We piloted educational strategies and an assessment instrument to teach and evaluate radiologists’ communication skills. We focused on communication in the diagnostic mammography suite, where patient–radiologist interactions are often intense and stressful.

## Materials and Methods

We adapted existing instruments to create a Radiology Communication Skills Assessment Tool (RCSAT). We piloted an educational program that included patients as teachers and raters of interpersonal and communication skills, and implemented a radiology objective structured clinical examination (OSCE). We measured radiology residents’ self-assessed skills, confidence and stress, as well as patient-rated communication skills using the RCSAT.

## Results

Residents’ baseline self-assessed communication skills regarding abnormal mammograms were fair, confidence in their communication was minimal, and they found this communication stressful. Overall baseline communication skills, rated by patient–teachers using the RCSAT, were 3.62 on a 5-point scale (1 = poor to 5 = excellent). Analysis of post-OSCE debriefing comments yielded nine themes regarding effective radiology communication, as well as residents’ reflections on the communication challenges they experience. The themes were integrated into subsequent RCSAT revisions. Residents’ reflections were used to inform teaching workshops.

## Conclusion

Educational curricula on communication about difficult information can be implemented in radiology training programs. Radiology residents’ performance can be assessed using a communication skills assessment tool during standardized patient–teacher encounters. Further research is necessary in this important domain.

Effective communication is an essential component of high-quality, safe patient care. The importance of communication is recognized by the public and by new standards for professional licensure and postgraduate program accreditation ( ). Effective communication in the primary care disciplines has been shown to improve clinical outcomes and patient and physician satisfaction and reduce malpractice suits ( ). Educational interventions in primary care have significantly altered the process of interpersonal interactions with positive effects on objective (e.g., blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c \[Hb  A1c \]) and subjective (e.g., illness experience, patient satisfaction) health outcomes ( ).

Radiologists must communicate abnormal or uncertain mammographic findings to women, shepherd patients through complex interventions, and communicate with technologists and other health care providers to ensure coordinated care. Little is known, however, about the nature and impact of the process of communication among radiologists, other health professionals, and patients. Radiologist−patient communication challenges are heightened by the absence of previous or ongoing relationships and the short amount of time available to develop rapport. Despite the importance and challenges inherent in radiologist communication with patients, more radiologists than other specialists in one survey (80% vs. 47%, _P_ < .001) reported feeling insufficiently trained in communication skills ( ). Radiology residents and faculty have expressed interest in enhancing their communication and interpersonal interactions ( ).

Participant Suggestions for Effective Communication: Post-OSCE Debriefing Session


**Preparation:** • Be prepared with factual data. • Try to imagine yourself in that person’s shoes. • Be aware of your own reactions.**Set-up:** • Introduce yourself and your role. • Apologize if there’s been a wait. • Professional hand shake.**Nonverbal behaviors:** • Eye contact. • Maintain appropriate personal space. • Respond to nonverbal clues. • Open, receptive body language. • Calm demeanor.**Elicit information about patient’s understanding and emotional state:** • Use open-ended questions. • Active listening. • Ask questions to elicit patient’s understanding of procedures or what’s been said. • Give patient space to deal with the information, respond and question. • Determine what patient wants and needs. • Ongoing gauge of patient’s emotions as you’re sharing information.**Understand the patient’s context:** • Pay attention to contextual circumstances, e.g., family history. • Ask about why they feel the way they do.**Respond to patient’s emotional state:** • Acknowledge feelings and concerns. • Respectful, nonjudgmental attitude. • Ask about or offer support.**Provide information:** • Give correct information in language patient can understand. • Avoid euphemisms. • “Realistic optimism.”**Decision-making:** • Explain options, their advantages and disadvantages. • Make recommendations. • Ask for patient’s input in decision-making process. • Talk about time-frame patient has for making decisions. • If several step process, encourage taking one step at a time.**Planning:** • Be explicit about next steps. • Be explicit about the follow-up communication plan. • If patient plans to seek second opinion, ask to be informed about who will follow the patient.

Rachel G. is sitting in the office waiting for the radiologist after having a mammogram. She knows something is wrong because the technician asked her to wait while she got the radiologist. She is visibly upset and tearful with tissues in hand.

Clair M. is a single, 58-year-old physics professor. Clair undergoes screening mammography every 4 years because she does not believe there is solid evidence to support current screening recommendations and prefers to avoid the radiation exposure. The day after this year’s screening mammogram, Clair received a call from the mammography center asking her to return for extra mammographic views. The screening mammogram revealed a questionable developing density in the outer aspect of the right breast seen only in one view.
