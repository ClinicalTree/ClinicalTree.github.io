This is a case-based textbook of musculoskeletal imaging. The intended audience includes anyone interested in learning about musculoskeletal imaging. The editor, Dr Jamshid Tehranzadeh, is the director of musculoskeletal imaging and chief of radiology at the University of California, Irvine. The work is a product of more than 70 collaborating authors from the United States and around the world.

The text is very well organized, divided into anatomic sections: shoulder, elbow, hand and wrist, hip and pelvis, knee, ankle and foot, and spine. Each anatomic section is subdivided into cases related to sports medicine and trauma, congenital abnormalities, systemic and metabolic diseases, arthritis, infections, tumor and tumorlike lesions, and a miscellaneous section. Each case occupies two pages. The first page includes the case-specific images with a brief history, findings, differential diagnoses with brief discriminators, and a concise discussion. A box with bullet-point “pearls” is also included to highlight and emphasize teaching points. The following page of each case includes additional images of the same disease, along with images of the diseases included in the differential diagnoses, which also include annotations and findings.

This is an excellent, very well organized and written case-based text of musculoskeletal imaging. The image quality is superb throughout, and all imaging modalities are included: plain film, ultrasound, scintigraphy, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Sports medicine and trauma are emphasized in each section, with fewer cases devoted to the remaining subdivisions, as reflected by what is most often encountered in practice. Effort was made to include cases most relevant to everyday practice, without many unusual, rare cases. The book is useful for learning about musculoskeletal diseases, studying for oral boards, generating a differential diagnosis on the basis of imaging findings, and learning discriminators of various diseases with similar imaging characteristics. The text would also be useful for referencing particular entities at the workstation. This book would be an excellent resource for medical students interested in musculoskeletal radiology, radiology residents and musculoskeletal fellows, practicing radiologists, and orthopedic surgeons. Any reading room would benefit from a copy.
