## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the applicability of a novel macromolecular polyethylene glycol (PEG)-core gadolinium contrast agent for monitoring early antiangiogenic effects of bevacizumab using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

Athymic rats ( _n_ = 26) implanted with subcutaneous human melanoma xenografts underwent DCE-MRI at 2.0 T using two different macromolecular contrast agents. The PEG core cascade polymer PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 , designed for clinical development, was compared to the prototype, animal-only, macromolecular contrast medium (MMCM) albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 . The treatment ( _n_ = 13) and control ( _n_ = 13) group was imaged at baseline and 24 hours after a single dose of bevacizumab (1 mg) or saline to quantitatively assess the endothelial-surface permeability constant (K  PS , μL⋅min⋅100 cm  3 ) and the fractional plasma volume (fPV,%), using a two-compartment kinetic model.

## Results

Mean K  PS values, assessed with PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 , declined significantly ( _P_ < .05) from 29.5 ± 10 μL⋅min⋅100 cm  3 to 10.4 ± 7.8 μL⋅min⋅100 cm  3 by 24 hours after a single dose of bevacizumab. In parallel, K  PS values quantified using the prototype MMCM albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 showed an analogous, significant decline ( _P_ < .05) in the therapy group. No significant effects were detected on tumor vascularity or on microcirculatory parameters in the control group between the baseline and the follow-up scan at 24 hours.

## Conclusion

DCE-MRI enhanced with the novel MMCM PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 was able to monitor the effects of bevacizumab on melanoma xenografts within 24 hours of a single application, validated by the prototype, animal-only albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 . PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 may be a promising candidate for further clinical development as a macromolecular blood pool contrast MRI agent.

Functional and molecular imaging techniques have been examined extensively to define their potential for monitoring the tumor angiogenesis. Established morphologic assessments relying on tumor size such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 do not have adequate sensitivity for detection of tumor responses to antiangiogenic therapy in a desirable short time period . Data indicate that magnetic resonance (MR) morphology alone, including size or contrast enhancement, will not be adequate to monitor angiogenesis treatment . Dynamic, contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR imaging (MRI) enhanced with macromolecular contrast media (MMCM) has been investigated in experimental studies for monitoring tumor angiogenesis, based on the dependence of endothelial macromolecular permeability on tissue vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity. VEGF potently increases macromolecular permeability whereas inhibition of VEGF, shown with a variety of antiangiogenesis drugs and cancer models, reduces macromolecular permeability . The range of diagnostic utility for MMCM-enhanced MRI in cancer characterization has been demonstrated in recent years using animal models and the prototypic MMCM albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 in differentiating benign and malignant tumors, in grading the degree of tumor aggressiveness, in detecting early responses to antiangiogenesis drug therapy, and in use as a predictive biomarker of tumor response . However, albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 is considered to be poorly suited for use in humans because of incomplete elimination and concerns of immunogenicity . Hence, new MMCM are being sought that have blood kinetic properties similar to albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 and will be appropriate for application in humans. Among currently investigated macromolecular contrast agents are polymers, dendrimers, and noncovalent complexes of small molecule agents with proteins including novel biodegradable compounds such as a polydisulfide with Gd-DOTA monoamide side chains or triazine dendrimers derivatized with a DOTA or DTPA .

The current study advances the evaluation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) core Gd macromolecular contrast agents, specifically PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 , representing a novel class of macromolecular contrast agents. PEG-core MMCM are designed specifically for clinical safety in humans, while meeting the physicochemical and pharmacologic requirements of contrast agents intended for quantitative MRI characterization of blood vessels . This initial experimental study was conducted to investigate the applicability of PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA)  16 for monitoring of antiangiogenic therapy analogous to the established prototype albumin-(Gd-DTPA)  35 .

This new class of macromolecular contrast medium consists of a linear PEG core and two peripheral lysine-dendrimer amplifiers, which are conjugated, with multiple highly stable Gd-DOTA chelates serving as signal enhancing groups in magnetic resonance imaging. PEG12,000-Gen4-(Gd-DOTA) 16 , being extremely hydrophilic and bulky, creates a water shield around the polymer, making the effective size (molecular weight [MW] = 194 kDa) much greater than indicated by the actual MW (27 kDa).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EvaluationofaNovelMacromolecularCascadePolymerContrastMediumforDynamicContrastEnhancedMRIMonitoringofAntiangiogenicBevacizumabTherapyinaHumanMelanomaModel/0_1s20S1076633213003401.jpg)
