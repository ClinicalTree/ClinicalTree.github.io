## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) features of benign adnexal lesions.

## Methods and Materials

We report the MDCT features of 68 histologically proven benign adnexal lesions. Pathologic diagnoses were nonneoplastic adnexal cysts ( _n_ = 16), endometriomas ( _n_ = 12), serous or mucinous cystadenomas ( _n_ = 15), fibromas or fibrothecomas ( _n_ = 7), teratomas ( _n_ = 6), and a variety of benign adnexal lesions ( _n_ = 12). The CT protocol included scanning of the abdomen after the intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material (portal phase) using a detector collimation of 16 × 0.75 mm and a pitch of 1.2.

## Results

Ovarian cysts had a characteristic CT appearance of a cystic lesion, with smooth, thin wall, and occasionally a few septa. Serous and mucinous cystadenomas were detected as multilocular cystic tumors containing serous fluid or liquids of higher than water CT density, respectively. Dilated fallopian tube was seen as an oblong, tubular, fluid-filled structure. MDCT was accurate to characterize mature cystic teratomas. Endometriomas had a variable CT appearance, including a unilocular or multilocular cystic mass, and a homogeneous hyperdense mass lesion. Fibrous tissue had a 50 HU CT density in patients with fibromas or fibrothecomas.

## Conclusion

MDCT may provide accurate diagnostic information about the benign nature of adnexal lesions.

Ultrasonography remains the primary imaging modality in the workup of patients with suspected adnexal masses, with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), although more specific in the characterization and differentiation of ovarian masses, reserved for problem-solving cases . The relatively uncommon use of computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of benign adnexal mass lesions has resulted in a paucity of the English-language literature regarding their CT findings . Benign adnexal masses were evaluated by CT either during the investigation of an undiagnosed abdominal mass or as an incidental finding during CT examination performed for other reasons .

Multidetector CT (MDCT) greatly improved the accuracy of CT in detecting and characterizing adnexal mass lesions . Although MDCT is not considered the study of choice in the initial evaluation of adnexal masses, it proved accurate in the detection of ovarian masses, providing an accurate assessment of their internal architecture characteristics, a reliable differentiation of benign from malignant adnexal mass lesions, and an accurate preoperative staging of the disease in cases of ovarian malignancies .
