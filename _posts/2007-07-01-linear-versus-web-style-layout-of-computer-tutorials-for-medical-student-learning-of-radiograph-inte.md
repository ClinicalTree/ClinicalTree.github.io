## Rationale and Objective

We sought to determine which is more effective in increasing skill in radiograph interpretation: a linear (PowerPoint-style) computer tutorial that locks the student into a fixed path through the material or a branched (Web-style) version that allows random access.

## Materials and Methods

We prepared a computer tutorial for learning how to interpret cervical spine radiographs. The tutorial has 66 screens including radiographs or graphics on almost every page and five unknown radiographs for the student to interpret. One version (linear) presents the material in a linear sequence with the unknown radiographs heading up “chapters” detailing an important aspect of the task. In the second (branched) version, the same 66 screens were accessed through hyperlinks in a frame beside the unknown radiographs. One hundred thirty-nine medical students at two sites participated in a randomized single-blinded controlled experiment. They interpreted cervical spine images as a pretest and then completed one of the two tutorial versions. Afterward, they did the same examination as a post-test.

## Results

The tutorial was successful, in both layouts, in improving the subjects’ ability to interpret cervical spine radiograph images (effect size 2.1; 95% confidence interval 1.7−2.5). However, the layout did not make a difference to their gain in ability. Students in the linear group completed the tutorial in 17% less time ( _P_ < .001) but were slightly less likely to rate the tutorial as “valuable.”

## Conclusion

For these novice learners, computer tutorial layout does not affect knowledge gain. Students may be more satisfied with the linear layout, but in time-pressured situations, the Web-style layout may be preferable because it is more efficient.

The skill of radiograph interpretation includes recognition of visual features and the use of a procedure to ensure that all relevant information is considered. Students learn this skill through a combination of instruction and practice. Computer tutorials are an excellent medium for this learning since they facilitate aggregation of representative radiograph examples, and they allow novel instructional designs that are more interactive than textbooks or radiology teaching files ( ). There are a large number of online resources and CD-ROM computer tutorials available for this particular skill ( ). Unfortunately, rigorous evaluations of their educational impact are lacking.

These computer tutorials are generally laid out in one of two formats. The first type is a linear PowerPoint style of presentation that is _behaviorist_ in that the goals are prespecified and the path of the student is largely determined ahead of time by the instructor. The _behaviorist_ philosophy specifies that learning best takes place when a desired change in behavior is prespecified ( ). The educator provides a program of instruction specific to named objectives. Typical examples of instructional designs based on this “top-down” philosophy are lectures and programmed instruction. This method has the advantage of being very efficient.

![Figure 1, Schematic representation of the layouts of the two tutorials. In the linear group, the content of the tutorial was presented using serial screens of information. Unknown images are presented in sequence as one of the first screens for a given section of the tutorial. For example, the “Alignment” section begins with an image for which the key feature was malalignment of the cervical spine. For the Web-layout group, the content of the tutorial was presented using serial unknown images. The tutorial included the same number of unknown images but they were grouped together to form the backbone of the tutorial. Knowledge content could be accessed in any order from any of the unknown images. For each of the unknowns, a hyperlink was included that lead the student to the appropriate section for learning about the given anomaly.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LinearVersusWebStyleLayoutofComputerTutorialsforMedicalStudentLearningofRadiographInterpretation/0_1s20S107663320700205X.jpg)

The student is asked to click with the left mouse button over a feature that suggests that this radiograph may be abnormal. (b) Second, after the student clicks on the unknown screen, the tutorial first presents a textual explanation of the features. (c) Third, clicking on the “Outline” button of the textual explanation reveals this visual explanation where the features on the radiograph are segmented and interpreted.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LinearVersusWebStyleLayoutofComputerTutorialsforMedicalStudentLearningofRadiographInterpretation/1_1s20S107663320700205X.jpg)
