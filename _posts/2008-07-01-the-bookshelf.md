The third edition of _Practical Pediatric Radiology_ continues to serve as a well-organized and well-written volume addressing the imaging of pediatric patients in regard to their clinical presentation. Its targeted audience includes radiologists who are not solely involved in working with pediatric patients and thus may benefit from a reference detailing the more common issues encountered in pediatric imaging.

As with prior editions, the majority of the book's chapters are divided according to common presenting complaints in the pediatric population. Within each chapter, the authors elaborate on the likely diagnoses and their associated imaging findings. Helpful tables near the beginning of most chapters assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis based on the patient's age, anatomic region, relative disease prevalence, and acute versus chronic nature. Compared to the second edition, the tables are of larger font and more clearly organized. This edition boasts “more than 1,000 … images, plus flow charts and line illustrations.” Indeed, hardly a single page is left solely with text. Many of the plain film images seen in the previous edition appear in this current volume. An increased number, and updated quality, of cross-sectional and ultrasound images are now present. Well-constructed diagrams serve as a useful highlight of key concepts, often so effectively as to make corresponding text approach superfluousness.

Of the notable new additions, certainly the one most deserving of mention is the nearly 100-page first chapter, “Atlas of Normal Anatomy of the Premature and Term Infant.” Detailed anatomic drawings of the neonatal brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis by Roland Helmus and Marianne Luck are complemented by contrast-enhanced radiographs highlighting the organ system of interest. This chapter could stand alone as an excellent resource for anyone wishing to have a better understanding of the unique anatomic relationships in the neonate.

Other chapters new to the book include two devoted to the ultrasound evaluation of the central nervous system, “Cranial Ultrasonography ” and “Spinal Ultrasonography.” Both provide a wealth of images, including a series of normal appearances of the brain at various levels on both coronal and sagittal views. Revisions of previous chapters include that on “The Child With Abdominal Trauma.” Updated computed tomographic protocols and images, as well as the inclusion of common trauma grading schemes for visceral organ injuries, keep this chapter current with the standard of care.

By organizing the text's chapters in a symptom-based fashion, the book becomes a valuable reference that allows the reader to quickly establish a differential diagnosis and view possible imaging findings in a relatively brief amount of time. Unfortunately, this organization may be perceived by some as a drawback, particularly those accustomed to texts divided according to anatomic or pathologic criteria. It is quite possible that these readers may be left feeling less fulfilled than with a more “traditional” text. Regardless, the authors should be applauded for improving on an already outstanding book. This latest entry continues to live up to its title as a practical and relevant resource in dealing with the challenges unique to the imaging of pediatric patients.
