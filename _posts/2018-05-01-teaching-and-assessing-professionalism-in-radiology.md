Teaching and assessing trainees' professionalism now represents an explicit expectation for Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education–accredited radiology programs. Challenges to meeting this expectation include variability in defining the construct of professionalism; limits of traditional teaching and assessment methods, used for competencies historically more prominent in medical education, for professionalism; and emerging expectations for credible and feasible professionalism teaching and assessment practices in the current context of health-care training and practice.

This article identifies promising teaching resources and methods that can be used strategically to augment traditional teaching of the cognitive basis for professionalism, including role modeling, case-based scenarios, debriefing, simulations, narrative medicine (storytelling), guided discussions, peer-assisted learning, and reflective practice. This article also summarizes assessment practices intended to promote learning, as well as to inform how and when to assess trainees as their professional identities develop over time, settings, and autonomous practice, particularly in terms of measurable behaviors. This includes assessment tools (including mini observations, critical incident reports, and appreciative inquiry) for authentic assessment in the workplace; engaging multiple sources (self-, peer, other health professionals, and patients) in assessment; and intentional practices for trainees to take responsibility for seeking our actionable feedback and reflection. This article examines the emerging evidence of the feasibility and value added of assessment of medical competency milestones, including professionalism, coordinated by the Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education in radiology and other medical specialties. Radiology has a strategic opportunity to contribute to scholarship and inform policies in professionalism teaching and assessment practices.

## Introduction

Teaching and assessing trainees' development of competence in professionalism now represents an explicit expectation for Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited programs in radiology. Existing peer-reviewed publications in medical education, including publications in _Academic Radiology_ , have identified challenges for teaching and assessing competency in professionalism. These challenges include variability in defining professionalism and ethics, as well as the predominance of traditional methods for teaching (eg, lectures) that emphasized efficiently transmitting knowledge about the cognitive basis of other medical competencies historically more prominent in medical training. Additional challenges include that the implicit curriculum, in which learners see and hear practices disparaging or contradicting professionalism, heavily influences what trainees learn about professionalism. Professionalism education can also be challenged to help trainees anticipate and reflect on perceived threats to professionalism from the larger social context, in, for example, perceptions of vulnerability to market pressures over patient advocacy, or gender or class-based harassment.

To address these challenges and expectations, this article identifies defined expectations for developing competency in professionalism, and reviews teaching approaches for professionalism that acknowledge and work with each learners' (medical student or resident) unique professional experiences and interactions affecting their understanding of professionalism. It also identifies assessment approaches intended to promote safe and effective learning of professionalism, and considers opportunities for radiology educators to contribute to scholarly evaluation of professionalism teaching and assessment practices and policies for evaluating professionalism education.

## Definition of Competence in Professionalism

The social contract underlies the “ _why_ ” of professionalism; the definition of “ _what_ ” the ACGME explains professionalism consists is that “residents must demonstrate a commitment to carrying out professional responsibilities, adherence to ethical principles…” To meet this definition, residents are “expected to demonstrate respect, altruism, honesty, compassion and integrity; demonstrate a commitment to ethical principles; and demonstrate sensitivity and responsiveness to patients' culture, age, gender and disabilities” .

Professionalism can also be framed in terms of roles, duties, actions, skills, behavior, beliefs, and attitudes.
