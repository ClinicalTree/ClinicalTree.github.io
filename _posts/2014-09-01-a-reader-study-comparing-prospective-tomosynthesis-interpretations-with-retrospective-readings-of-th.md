## Rationale and Objectives

To compare performance of prospective interpretations of clinical tomosynthesis (digital breast tomosynthesis \[DBT\]) plus full-field digital mammography (FFDM) examinations with retrospective readings of the corresponding FFDM examinations alone.

## Methods and Materials

Seven Mammography Quality Standard Act–qualified radiologists retrospectively interpreted 10,878 FFDM examinations that had been interpreted by other radiologists during prospective clinical interpretations of DBT plus FFDM. The radiologists were blinded to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) category given during the clinical interpretations and the verified outcome by follow-up and/or any diagnostic workup that may have followed. Ratings (BIRADS 0, 1, or 2) were recorded. Group performance levels in terms of recall rates and attributable cancer detection rates were compared to the prospective clinical interpretations of the same examinations (DBT plus FFDM) using McNemar test (two sided/tailed) with significance level of .05.

## Results

During the prospective clinical interpretations of DBT plus FFDM, 588 cases were recalled (588 of 10,878, 5.41%) compared to 888 cases recalled (888 of 10,878, 8.16%) during the FFDM-alone retrospective interpretations (absolute difference, 35%; _P_ < .0001). There were 59 and 38 suspicious abnormalities later verified as cancers detected during the DBT plus FFDM and the FFDM-alone interpretations, respectively (absolute increase, 55%; _P_ < .0001). Invasive cancer detections were 48 and 29, respectively (absolute increase, 66%; _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusions

The combination of DBT plus FFDM for screening asymptomatic women resulted in a significant reduction in recall rates and a simultaneous increase in cancer detection rates when compared to retrospective interpretations of corresponding FFDM examinations alone.

Although routine full-field digital mammography (FFDM) is widely accepted as a screening tool in the United States, its limitations are well known. Of concern are the reported high recall rates and low positive predictive values for recalls, a reported 10% (range: 6%–13%) and ∼5% (range: 4.4%–16.8%), respectively . This means that ∼95% of abnormalities recalled from screening mammography are ultimately found to be negative. In addition, mammography screening has a relatively low cancer detection rate, particularly after the first 2 years of screening and for women with dense breast tissue. Variability in performance levels among radiologists who read and interpret mammograms is large and is attributed in part to the difficulty in distinguishing suspicious lesions from the adjacent overlapping tissue .

In recent years, a major effort has been expended to develop new and better approaches in screening for early detection of breast cancer, one of which is the use of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). DBT enables the reconstruction of cross-sectional images aimed to assist radiologists with the interpretation process through better visualization of breast tissue patterns by minimizing issues associated with overlapping tissue . The goal of this approach is to improve screening performance by lowering recall rates while increasing sensitivity, particularly for invasive cancers . There have been several reports on the performance of radiologists during interpretations of DBT examinations, which to date have been performed primarily in combination with FFDM . These studies included both retrospective and prospective interpretations . The results of these studies were quite consistent in exhibiting combined performance gains in recall and cancer detection rates when radiologists interpret DBT-based screening examinations. Although these studies exhibited a wide variability in terms of the magnitude of improvements, all studies reported a combined improvement in the range of 30%–60% despite the variability in the type of practices. The issue of comparing examinations in DBT-based clinical practices that typically compare both FFDM plus DBT to FFDM alone is that differences in clinical decision making under the two approaches could affect care. In Europe, where double reading is often performed routinely followed by an arbitration or consensus decision, this is a substantially easier task. With the arbitration process, one can design a prospective study in which the workflow is quite similar to traditional practices . However, because of the limitation of professional resources in the United States, combined with primarily the single reader approach to the interpretation of mammograms, the process that leads to the decision of whether to recall a patient is more difficult to perform in a prospective manner.

DBT, digital breast tomosynthesis; FFDM, full-field digital mammography.


Note that different cases were read by different radiologists under each of the two modes. Totals for FFDM alone include two cases that were “recalled” (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 0) during the retrospective interpretation and were actually recalled as a result of the secondary/arbitration review and found to have cancers; hence, they constitute false-negative cases for DBT.
