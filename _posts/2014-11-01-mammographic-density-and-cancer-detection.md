## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the impact of breast density on the performance of radiologists when mammograms are digitally acquired and displayed.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 150 craniocaudal digital mammograms including 75 cases with cancer were examined by 14 radiologists divided into two groups: those who read more (six) and less (eight) than 2000 mammograms per year. Cases were classified as low or high mammographic density. For both types of cases, detection of cancers within and outside the dense fibroglandular tissue was investigated. The performance of radiologist was measured using jack-knife free-response receiver operating characteristic (JAFROC) figure of merit (FOM).

## Results

Radiologists with over 2000 annual reads had significantly higher JAFROC FOM ( _P_ = .03) for high (0.76) mammographic density compared to low (0.70) mammographic density cases. When lesions overlaid the fibroglandular tissue, cases with high mammographic density compared to low mammographic density displayed increased location sensitivity for all radiologists ( _P_ = .03) and for those radiologists reading more than 2000 mammograms annually ( _P_ = .04), whereas JAFROC FOMs increased for all radiologists ( _P_ = .05). No significant changes were observed when the lesion was outside the fibroglandular region.

## Conclusions

Increased mammographic density improves the performance of experienced radiologists when using digital mammograms. This finding, which does not align with those previously reported for film screen systems, may be because of windowing/leveling opportunities available with digital images.

Mammography is the leading imaging modality for early detection of breast cancer, and as a screening tool it has significantly decreased breast cancer mortality . Mammographic images depict adipose and fibroglandular tissues, with the latter appearing as visually bright because of its higher attenuation coefficient compared to the more radiolucent adipose tissue . The visual representation of increased amounts of fibroglandular tissue is often referred to as mammographic density .

Previous studies have shown that increased mammographic density is associated with higher risk of missed malignancies and interval cancers , with sensitivity dropping from 80%–98% in fatty breasts to 29%–75% in mammographically dense breasts . In addition, increased numbers of large screen-detected tumors (>15 mm) , higher recall rates , and decreased efficiency of breast screening programs have all been linked to high levels of mammographic density.
