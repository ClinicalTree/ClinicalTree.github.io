## Rationale and Objectives

To determine lobar ventilation patterns in asthmatic lungs with hyperpolarized  3 He magnetic resonance imaging (HP  3 He MRI).

## Materials and Methods

Eighty-two subjects (14 normal, 48 mild-to-moderate asthma, and 20 severe asthma) underwent HP  3 He MRI, computed tomography (CT), and pulmonary function testing. After registering proton to  3 He images, we segmented the lungs from proton MRI and further segmented the five lung lobes (right upper lobe \[RUL\], right middle lobe \[RML\], and right lower lobe \[RLL\]; left upper lobe and left lower lobe \[LLL\]) by referring to the lobar segmentation from CT. We classified the gas volume into four signal intensity levels as follows: ventilation defect percent (VDP), low ventilation percent, medium ventilation percent, and high ventilation percent. The local signal intensity variations in the ventilated volume were estimated using heterogeneity score (Hs). We compared each ventilation level and Hs measured in the whole lung and lobar regions across the three subject groups.

## Results

In mild-to-moderate asthma, the RML and RUL showed significantly greater VDP than the two lower lobes (RLL and LLL) ( _P_ ≤ .047). In severe asthma, the pattern was more variable with the VDP in the RUL significantly greater than in the RLL ( _P_ = .026). In both asthma groups, the lower lobes (RLL and LLL) showed significantly higher high ventilation percent and Hs compared to the three upper lobes (all _P_ ≤ .015).

## Conclusions

In asthma, the RML and RUL showed greater ventilation abnormalities, and the RLL and LLL were more highly ventilated with greater local heterogeneity. These findings may facilitate guided bronchoscopic sampling and localized airway treatment in future studies.

## Introduction

Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway narrowing that leads to symptoms of wheezing, chest tightness, cough, and difficulty breathing. These symptoms result from underlying chronic inflammatory processes that render the airways hyper-responsive to perturbations that in normal airways would evoke a negligible response . The heterogeneity of airway obstruction is now well accepted, suggesting localized disease processes including persistent and reversible regions of obstruction, both of which have been visualized using functional imaging methods .

Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been used to characterize regions of airway thickening and regions of low parenchymal density at expiratory lung volume to identify air trapping . Independently, hyperpolarized helium-3 (HP  3 He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has demonstrated regions of lower than normal ventilation termed “ventilation defects” in asthma. Regional ventilation abnormalities have also been associated with airway disease including airway narrowing , air trapping, and inflammation . HP  3 He MRI and CT have been used in combination to compare structure-function associations between anatomical markers of airway remodeling and ventilation defects . Such regionally specific approaches show promise for better characterizing regional ventilation heterogeneity in asthma generally as well as localized therapy, for example, bronchial thermoplasty .
