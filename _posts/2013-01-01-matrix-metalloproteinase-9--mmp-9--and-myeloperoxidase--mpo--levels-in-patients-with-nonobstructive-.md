## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether matrix metalloproteinase–9 (MMP-9) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) are elevated in patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease.

## Materials and Methods

Eighty-four patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease (group A) and 90 patients with no coronary plaques (group B) were enrolled. MMP-9 and MPO levels were compared between the two groups. The relationships between these biomarkers and Framingham risk score were analyzed. Receiver-operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the ability of these biomarkers to predict the presence of coronary artery plaques.

## Results

The MMP-9 and MPO values in group A were significantly higher than in group B ( _P_ < .001). The levels of MMP-9 and MPO showed significant correlations with Framingham risk score ( _r_ = 0.796, _P_ < .001, and _r_ = 0.409, _P_ < .001, respectively). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for MMP-9 and MPO were 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.87) and 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.81), respectively.

## Conclusions

Levels of MMP-9 and MPO are positively correlated with Framingham risk score. Additionally, in patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease, elevated levels of MMP-9 and MPO may identify patients at risk for future myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death.

Early reports have revealed that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), as identified by coronary computed tomographic angiography (cCTA) and defined by coronary plaques causing ≥50% reductions in luminal diameter, is valuable for the prognosis of individuals at risk for major adverse cardiovascular events . Nevertheless, individuals undergoing cCTA commonly exhibit nonobstructive plaques. Prior invasive ultrasound and autopsy studies have implicated nonobstructive plaques as central to the pathophysiologic processes of sudden cardiac death and myocardial infarction . But percutaneous or surgical revascularization is performed only in patients with >50% luminal stenosis. Nonobstructive plaques cannot be detected by traditional coronary angiography and may be considered normal.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of structurally and functionally related zinc endopeptidases, degrade extracellular matrix proteins and have been implicated in connective tissue destruction and remodeling . MMP-9, a significant member of the MMP family, has been found to degrade a wide range of extracellular matrix proteins, including gelatin, type IV collagen, and other basement membrane proteins . Increased levels of MMP-9 have been found in human atherosclerotic plaques involved in plaque rupture . Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is the most abundant component of primary azurophilic granules in neutrophils and is promptly discharged after activation by different agonists . First identified within human atherosclerotic plaques nearly a decade ago, MPO has emerged as an important factor in the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease . In clinical studies conducted in patients with acute coronary syndromes, an elevated level of MPO was associated with an adverse prognosis and the occurrence of major cardiovascular events .
