## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze the morphologic and functional features of metastatic lymph nodes of colorectal carcinoma on  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) images and correlate these with pathologic results to explore the best diagnostic performance.

## Methods

Sixty-eight patients without any previous treatment underwent  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT examinations and subsequent operations. All lymph nodes were evaluated by recording short diameter and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) on axial images and were carefully verified on the surgically resected specimens. The radiologic diagnostic efficacies on the basis of different diagnostic criteria were compared and evaluated with pathologic results.

## Results

There was a significant difference for SUVmax between metastatic and benign juxtaintestinal lymph nodes ( _F_ = 96.836, _P_ = .000) and a correlation between size and SUVmax in metastatic juxtaintestinal lymph nodes ( _r_ = 0.352, _P_ = .038). Diagnosing according to short diameter ≥ 10 mm and SUVmax ≥ 2.5, the sensitivity, specificity, positivity prediction value (PPV), and negative prediction value (NPV) were 10.00%, 98.26%, 66.67%, and 75.84% and 82.50%, 90.43%, 75.00%, and 93.69%, respectively. Considered together, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 10.00%, 99.13%, 80.00%, and 76.00%, respectively. Receiver-operating characteristic curves showed that the best cutoff values for SUVmax and short diameter were 2.0 and 4.85 mm, respectively; the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV, were 91.43%, 87.83%, 69.57%, and 97.12% and 85.71%, 60.87%, 40.00%, and 98.2%, respectively. Considered together, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 95.00%, 86.96%, 71.70%, and 98.04%, respectively.

## Conclusions

Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was a more reliable indicator in diagnosing malignant juxtaintestinal lymph node of colorectal carcinoma. The optimal diagnostic efficacy could be reached by considering morphologic and functional features together.

A great deal of research has shown that lymphatic metastasis is the most valuable prognostic factor for patients with resectable primary tumors . In addition, the survival rate of patients with colorectal carcinoma after operation would be markedly increased if the number of resected lymph nodes increased. Thus, it has been suggested that no fewer than 12 lymph nodes should be resected during an operation for colorectal carcinoma . Therefore, it is of great significance to precisely assess the range of lymph nodes involved preoperatively and to resect them during the operation to determine the correct nodal staging of colorectal cancer and subsequent therapy.

Computed tomographic (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were once the primary noninvasive methods for preoperative diagnosis of lymphatic metastasis of colorectal carcinoma. The identification of metastatic lymph nodes with CT imaging and MRI was based mainly on the size of lymph nodes, and a short-axis diameter > 1cm was accepted as the diagnostic criterion in many previous studies. However, the limitations of the simple morphologic criteria were obvious; metastases in normal-sized lymph nodes could be missed, and lymph node enlargement could not be reliably differentiated from cancerous infiltration. Thus, the accuracy of the detection of metastatic lymph nodes and nodal staging has been unsatisfactory for many years .

(a) A segment of sigmoid colon showed irregularly thickening and markedly abnormal 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) as high as 11.2. A small lymph node, without remarkable 18 F-FDG uptake, was noticed immediately adjacent to the tumor. This lymph node was radiologically considered a nonmetastatic juxtaintestinal lymph node and was proven by pathologic examination. (b) A lymph node could be seen located superior to the tumor. This lymph node showed abnormally increased 18 F-FDG uptake, and the SUVmax was 4.8. This lesion was diagnosed as a metastatic juxtaintestinal lymph node radiologically, and pathologic examination confirmed the result.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/TheMethodandEfficacyof18FfluorodeoxyglucosePositronEmissionTomographyComputedTomographyforDiagnosingtheLymphaticMetastasisofColorectalCarcinoma/2_1s20S1076633211006118.jpg)
