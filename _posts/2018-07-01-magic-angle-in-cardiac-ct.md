## Rationale and Objective

To identify the influence of various parameters for reducing artifacts in computed tomography (CT) of commonly used pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead tips.

## Materials and Methods

This ex vivo phantom study compared two CT techniques (Dual-Energy CT \[DECT\] vs. Dual-Source CT \[DSCT\]), as well as the influence of incremental alterations of current-time product and pacemaker lead-tip angle with respect to the gantry plane. Four pacemaker leads and one ICD lead were evaluated. The images were assessed visually on a five-point Likert scale (1 = artifact free to 5 = massive artifacts). Likert values 1–3 represent clinically relevant, diagnostic image quality.

## Results

344 of 400 total images were rated with diagnostic image quality. The DECT and dual-source DSCT technique each scored 86% diagnostic image quality. Statistically, DECT images showed significantly improved image quality ( _P_ < .05). Concerning the current-time product, no statistically significant change was found. Regarding lead-tip positioning, an angle of ≤70° yielded 100% diagnostic image quality. Pacemaker and ICD leads were assessed to have statistically significant differences.

## Conclusions

Surprisingly, the lead-tip angle of 70° has been established as the key angle under which diagnostic image quality is always ensured, regardless of the imaging technique. Thus, we call 70° the “Magic angle” in CT pacemaker imaging.

## Introduction

Patients with implanted metallic devices are a common sight in clinical practice using computed tomography (CT). In particular, more than one million cardiovascular implantable electronic devices such as pacemakers (PMs) and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are being implanted in patients with cardiovascular diseases every year, and this number is rising .

These devices are usually implanted in an infraclavicular subcutaneous or submuscular pocket with a transvenous lead. Most ventricular leads are placed in the apex of the right ventricle (RV), and most atrial leads are implanted in the right atrial appendage. There is a 4.4% incidence of a lead dislodgement or malfunctioning (~44,000 patients) 1 year after implantation from which approximately 10,000 patients are suffering from possible lead perforation.
