## Rationale and Objectives

To detect whether the efficacy of microwave ablation (MWA) could be improved by preinjected fluids in an ex vivo porcine liver model.

## Materials and Methods

Ablations were performed for 12 minutes using energy output of impedance-based (power output gradually rose to 200W, maintained until increases in tissue impedance of 20 Ω, reduced to 10W, and switched on again 15 seconds later) in radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or 80 W in MWA. Before ablation, 5 mL of ethanol, distilled water, 0.9% NaCl solution, or 10% NaCl solution ( _n_ = 6 each) was injected into the targeted liver tissue. Ablations without fluid injection served as control. The ablation diameter, volume, shape index, and temperature were recorded and compared.

## Results

Preinjection of 0.9% or 10% NaCl solution resulted in larger coagulation volumes than that of the control group in RFA experiments (28.1 ± 2.9 cm  3 , 45.3 ± 6.3 cm  3 , 20.0 ± 2.5 cm  3 , respectively; _P_ < .05). Ethanol and distilled water had no impact on coagulation volumes in RFA. Preinjection of ethanol or 10% NaCl solution created smaller coagulation volumes than that of the control group in MWA experiments (34.3 ± 2.0 cm  3 , 33.9 ± 4.1 cm  3 , 58.0 ± 6.6 cm  3 , respectively; _P_ < .001). 0.9% NaCl solution and distilled water had no impact on coagulation volumes in MWA.

## Conclusion

In an ex vivo porcine liver, preinjected fluids do not benefit microwave ablation as those in radiofrequency ablation.

Image-guided microwave ablation (MWA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are two widely used thermal ablation therapies to eliminate primary or metastatic liver tumors, especially for patients who are not candidates for surgical resection or liver transplantation . In RFA, a high-frequency alternating electric current (375–500 kHz) is used to create ionic flow, which produces frictional heat and heat conduction to induce tissue necrosis. Tissue electrical and thermal conductivities are important during RFA . In contrast, MWA involves the application of electromagnetic field by perturbing polar molecules (primarily H  2 O) in tissue. Tissues with high water content readily absorb microwave .

Currently, thermal ablation therapy is being developed to yield a large area of controlled coagulation necrosis with a single application of energy. Several strategies have been developed to increase the amount of coagulation necrosis, including increasing energy deposition, modulating tissue characteristics, and modifying tissue blood flow . RFA efficacy was shown to be improved when tissue was injected with ethanol or NaCl solution prior to, or during the ablation procedure . In MWA, however, the mechanisms for increasing ablative coagulation may not necessarily be the same, because heating relies on a different mechanism. To improve MWA, the question of whether preinjected liquids improve ablation should be explored independently. The purpose of this study was to detect whether the efficacy of MWA could be improved by preinjected fluids, as those in RFA.
