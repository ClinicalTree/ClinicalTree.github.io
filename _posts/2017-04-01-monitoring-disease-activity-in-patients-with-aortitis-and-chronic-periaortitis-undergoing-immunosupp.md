## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the role of perfusion CT for monitoring inflammatory activity in patients with aortitis and chronic periaortitis undergoing immunosuppressive therapy.

## Materials and Methods

Seventeen symptomatic patients (median age 68.5 years) who underwent perfusion-based computed tomography (CT) monitoring after diagnostic contrast-enhanced CT were retrospectively included in this study. Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), volume transfer constant (k-trans), time to peak, and mean transit time were determined by setting circular regions of interest in prominently thickened parts of the vessel wall or perfused surrounding tissue at sites where the perfusion CT color maps showed a maximum BF value. Differences in CT perfusion and, morphological parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were tested for significance during therapy.

## Results

In all patients BF and BV dropped at second perfusion CT ( _P_ < 0.05). In aortitis patients, CRP dropped from 3.86 ± 5.31 mg/dL to 0.9 ± 1.37 mg/dL and in periaortitis patients from 1.78 ± 2.25 mg/dL to 0.79 ± 1.55 mg/dL, whereas ESR dropped from 45.71 ± 37.59 seconds to 8.57 ± 3.1 seconds and 36.78 ± 34.67 seconds to 17.22 ± 21.82 seconds in aortitis and in periaortitis, respectively.

## Conclusions

The course of perfusion CT parameters in aortitis and chronic periaortitis undergoing immunosuppressive therapy dropped at different extent after therapy.

## Introduction

Inflammatory disorders of the large vessel walls or such arising around large vessels are rare and generally difficult to diagnose because of discrete, unspecific symptoms and poor or partially missing serologic alterations. Aortitis and periaortitis (A/PA) are all-encompassing terms ascribed to these disorders. Due to the fact that large-vessel vasculitis and periaortitic conditions are commonly autoimmune-mediated and may be associated with other, potentially severe systemic diseases, imaging plays a major role in their diagnosis. Moreover, histological proof is mostly impracticable and risky. To limit these mostly incurable pathological conditions, immunosuppressive therapy is necessary and, once a diagnosis has been verified, generally prompted.

Morphological changes such as regression of pathological vessel wall thickening or perivascular tissue formation are expected during immunosuppression, but their magnitude and temporal course are quite variable and depend on the histological substrate (eg, inflammation vs. fibrosis) . Some of the retroperitoneal fibrosis persists even after successful systemic therapy . Using serological parameters like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and even leukocyte count has been proposed for monitoring these entities, but they can fail in up to 22% of cases, in particular in patients with PA. Moreover, these follow-up markers rapidly turn normal after onset of some novel therapeutic agents . Therefore, functional imaging techniques have advanced to the methods of choice in A/PA diagnosis, assessment of disease activity, and even therapy monitoring. Among them, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is capable of demonstrating vessel wall edema by increased T2-signal in the vessel wall as already reported in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or giant cell aortitis . Complementary, contrast enhancement in postcontrast T1w MRI sequences is considered more sensitive and a surrogate for inflammation-related angiogenesis . Another very frequently applied imaging technique in this clinical setting is 18F-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), reported to be a highly sensitive imaging tool that increases overall diagnostic accuracy and has a beneficial impact on medical management . However, due to its high sensitivity, FDG–PET-positive findings rapidly normalize during immunosuppression (hours—few days) so that the course of the underlying autoimmune process cannot be reliably assessed anymore.
