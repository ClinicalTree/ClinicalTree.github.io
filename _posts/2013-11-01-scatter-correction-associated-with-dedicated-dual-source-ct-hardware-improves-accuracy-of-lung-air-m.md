## Rationale and Objectives

Accurate assessment of air density used to quantitatively characterize amount and distribution of emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects has remained challenging. Hounsfield units (HU) within tracheal air can be considerably less negative than –1000 HU. This study has sought to characterize the effects of improved scatter correction used in dual-source pulmonary computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

Dual-source dual-energy (DSDE) and single-source (SS) scans taken at multiple energy levels and scan settings were acquired for quantitative comparison using anesthetized ovine ( _n_ = 6), swine ( _n_ = 13), and a lung phantom. Data were evaluated for the lung, inferior vena cava, and tracheal segments. To minimize the effect of cross-scatter, the phantom scans in the DSDE mode were obtained by reducing the current of one of the tubes to near zero.

## Results

A significant shift in mean HU values in the tracheal regions of animals and the phantom is observed, with values consistently closer to −1000 HU in DSDE mode. HU values associated with SS mode demonstrated a positive shift of up to 32 HU. In vivo tracheal air measurements demonstrated considerable variability with SS scanning, whereas these values were more consistent with DSDE imaging. Scatter effects in the lung parenchyma differed from adjacent tracheal measures.

## Conclusion

Data suggest that the scatter correction introduced into the dual-energy mode of imaging has served to provide more accurate CT lung density measures sought to quantitatively assess the presence and distribution of emphysema in COPD subjects. Data further suggest that CT images, acquired without adequate scatter correction, cannot be corrected by linear algorithms given the variability in tracheal air HU values and the independent scatter effects on lung parenchyma.

Quantitative computed tomographic (QCT) imaging is increasingly used for the characterization of the lung . Yet, reliable, repeatable, and accurate quantification of volumetric computed tomography (CT) data for assessment of lung density, particularly for longitudinal and multicenter studies, remains a challenge. It has been observed that air in the trachea of a chest CT scan is often significantly different from its true value of −1000 Hounsfield units (HU), and this varies between scanner makes and models . The variability of intrathoracic air HU measurements across sites, scanner makes, and models limits the accuracy when measuring air trappings and the extent of emphysema-like lung parenchyma, which has been defined as the percentage of voxels below −950 HU within the lung field on volumetric CT scans or the HU value below which 15% of lung voxels fall . The variability in intrathoracic air values makes comparisons between CT scanner makes and models challenging.

The motivation for this study was our preliminary observations in animal experiments that air in the trachea was consistently closer to −1000 HU when using Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash dual-source dual-energy (DSDE) scan mode compared to the same scanner's single-source (SS) scan mode. The primary difference between the DSDE and SS modes is the implementation of a dedicated hardware-based scatter correction in the DSDE mode, whereas the SS mode simply uses an antiscatter grid that is expected to block all scattered radiation. Therefore, the goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the scatter correction employed in the DSDE mode results in more accurate (closer to the nominal −1000 HU) CT numbers of air in the trachea compared to the antiscatter grid solution typical for conventional single-source CT.

The tracheal lumen, inferior vena cava, and lung parenchyma were segmented for determination of the respective mean HU and standard deviations. Two-tailed paired-difference _t_ -tests were used to determine the _P_ values for the SS versus DSDE comparisons across subjects. Shown are the HU values from the animal models from 80-kVp scans, with all scanning parameters matched except for scanning mode. A significant shift in HU is seen when comparing the trachea, IVC, and lung tissue in the paired SS versus DSDE scans for both swine and ovine.

A consistent CTDIvol of 12 (±0.1) mGy was used for each. The results here show the mean Hounsfield units (HU) for a sampling of the analyzed parameter changes. Additional controlled scans comparing slice thickness (0.6 or 0.75 mm), slice spacing (0.5 or 0.6 mm), and scan direction (craniocaudal or caudocranial) were also analyzed but not shown any meaningful difference in mean values compared to the control. Reference computed tomography number for internal “trachea” air is −1000 HU.
