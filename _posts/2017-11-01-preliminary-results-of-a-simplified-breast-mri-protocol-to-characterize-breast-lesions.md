## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to investigate whether a simplified breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol consisting of a localizer, one precontrast sequence, and three time-point postcontrast sequences (at 28 seconds, 84 seconds and 252 seconds after the contrast agent administration) is suitable for the characterization of breast lesions as compared to a full diagnostic protocol (FDP). This study also aimed to review the current literature concerning abbreviated breast MRI protocols and offer an alternative protocol.

## Materials and Methods

Breast magnetic resonance (MR) examinations with detected breast lesions of 98 patients were retrospectively evaluated. Two expert radiologists in consensus reviewed the simplified breast protocol (SBP) first and only thereafter the regular FDP, recording a diagnosis for each detected lesion for both protocols. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic performance of the SBP compared to the standard FDP. A revision of the previously reported abbreviated breast magnetic resonance protocols was also carried out.

## Results

A total of 180 lesions were identified; of these, 110 (61%) were malignant and 70 (39%) were benign. Of the 110 malignant lesions, 86 (78%) were invasive ductal carcinoma, 18 (16%) were invasive lobular carcinoma, and 6 (6%) were ductal carcinoma in situ. Areas under the curve for the receiver operating characteristic curves for the SBP vs the FDP were equivalent (0.98 vs 0.99, respectively; _P_ = 0.76). The SBP could be performed in approximately 6 minutes and 58 seconds, compared to 14 minutes and 48 seconds for the FDP.

## Conclusions

An SBP protocol including a late postcontrast time point is accurate for the characterization of breast lesions and was comparable to the standard FDP protocol, allowing a potential reduction of the total acquisition and interpretation times.

## Introduction

MMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely recognized as a useful imaging modality for the screening of high-risk women because of its higher sensitivity, for preoperative and post-treatment evaluation, for the investigation of carcinoma of unknown primary tumor or syndrome, and for patients without conclusive mammographic or sonographic imaging findings . Recently, there is increasing evidence on the use of abbreviated protocols (APs) for diagnostic purposes; many different abbreviated breast MRI protocols have been proposed as possible alternatives to the standard full breast MRI protocol to reduce acquisition time for breast cancer screening and for lesion characterization . In particular, Kuhl et al. have recently shown the accuracy of an AP for screening purpose, consisting of only one precontrast and one postcontrast acquisition and their derived images (first postcontrast subtracted and maximum intensity projection images). We have noticed that almost all the APs reported in the literature include a combination of morphologic T2-weighted sequence or early dynamic postcontrast time points; none of the above-mentioned APs include the later postcontrast time point, which is, according to our experience, as important as the first postcontrast time point to detect essential morphologic and dynamic breast lesions details. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether a breast MRI protocol consisting of a localizer, a precontrast acquisition, and three time-point postcontrast sequences (at 28, 84, and 252 seconds after the contrast agent administration), which we defined as a “simplified breast protocol” (SBP), is accurate for the characterization of breast lesions and faster as well, compared to a full diagnostic breast MRI protocol; we also aimed to revise the current literature concerning abbreviated breast MRI protocols.
