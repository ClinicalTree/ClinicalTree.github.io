## Rationale and Objective

In 2004, Harvard Medical School initiated a pilot program, the Cambridge Integrated Clerkship, in which students study the core third-year medical disciplines in a longitudinal yearlong experience. In this paper, the authors describe the design of the radiology portion of this program and compare outcomes to those of students in a traditional curriculum.

## Materials and Methods

Students in the integrated curriculum were compared to students in traditional clerkships on the basis of Objective Structured Clinical Examination cases, final exams, fourth-year comprehensive exam scores, and choice of specialty.

## Results

Scores on Objective Structured Clinical Examination cases and imaging final exams were not statistically different between the two groups, but Integrated Clerkship students had statistically lower scores on final exams. Integrated Clerkship students scored higher on the fourth-year radiology comprehensive exam than traditional students, but differences were not statistically significant. Choice of radiology as a specialty was not statistically different between the two groups.

## Conclusions

Teaching radiology in an integrated yearlong curriculum is feasible, with a minimal drop in exam scores but no changes in other evaluative measures and no decrease in the choice of radiology as a specialty. The program may give students a better appreciation of the role of radiology in an ambulatory setting and in relationship to other specialties.

Changes in the US health care delivery system, with shortening of hospital stays and a shift toward ambulatory care, have had a negative impact on the educational environment for medical students during many clinical rotations . In the traditional hospital-based intensive-immersion model of clinical education, medical students have less time with patients and fewer substantial duties in patient care, with little emphasis on generalist or primary care skills . Some traditional clerkships have responded by increasing outpatient experiences or changing the proportion of time in acute care environments, but these changes may be difficult depending on the specific practice setting. In an attempt to rethink the way third-year medical students are trained, a pilot program was developed at a teaching hospital with extensive ambulatory sites, Cambridge Health Alliance, a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School (HMS), that included a major shift away from hospital-based settings as well as integration over a yearlong period of all core disciplines, including radiology .

In this paper, we describe the methodology and evolution of the radiology component of the Cambridge Integrated Clerkship. Preliminary results comparing student outcomes on summative radiology examinations are presented, as well as information on residency selection by students in the traditional clerkship compared to the Integrated Clerkship over the past 4 years. Future plans for the program are also presented, along with a discussion of the limitations of this approach.
