## Rationale and Objectives

A number of studies have reported decreases in fractional anistropy (FA) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis in order to estimate the diagnostic test accuracy measures of DTI for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

## Materials and Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966–April 2011), EMBASE (1999–April 2011), CINAHL (1999–April 2011), and Cochrane (2005–April 2011) databases to identify studies that measured FA in ALS subjects. Human, single-center studies using a DTI region of interest (ROI) or tractography techniques were used to compare FA values along the brain corticospinal tracts between ALS subjects and healthy controls. There were no language restrictions. Independent extraction of articles by 2 authors using predefined data fields including study quality indicators. We identified 30 case-control studies that used region of interest or tractography DTI techniques. We applied binormal receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assign specificity and sensitivity for each study. We applied the bivariate mixed-effects regression model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulation to calculate summary estimates for the sensitivity and specificity. We used the _metan_ module in Stata, version 11.0, to calculate the area under the ROC curve, diagnostic odds ratio and the test effectiveness summary estimates.

## Results

The pooled sensitivity was 0.65 (95% CI 0.61–0.69); the pooled specificity, 0.67 (95% CI 0.63–0.72); the pooled diagnostic odds ratio, 1.88 (95% CI 1.46–2.30); the pooled test effectiveness, 1.04 (95% CI 0.81–1.27); and the pooled area under the ROC curve, 0.76 (95% CI 0.71–0.81). Subanalyses comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T) and brain location (corticospinal tract average vs. internal capsule) revealed no significant differences in the test accuracy measures. Reference standard used for the diagnosis of ALS was the El Escorial criteria. There was at least moderate heterogeneity between the studies. True study quality is uncertain.

## Conclusion

The discriminatory capability of DTI to make a diagnosis of ALS is only modest. There were no significant differences in the diagnostic test accuracy summary estimates with respect to MRI field strength or brain location.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative condition of the corticospinal tract and spinal anterior horn cells, presents with varying degrees of lower motor neuron (LMN) and upper motor neuron (UMN) signs . The incidence of ALS is estimated to be 1.5–2.7 per 100,000 , with a uniformly fatal outcome. Mean survival of 2–4 years after initial diagnosis has been reported . Delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis reaches one year , which in part is due to an absence of reliable biomarkers. Thus, objective diagnostic tests to establish and corroborate extent of UMN disease are needed .

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an advanced neuroimaging technique, quantifies the local microenvironmental characteristics of water diffusion and evaluates the integrity of white matter fiber tracts . DTI holds promise as a potential biomarker to detect the pathologic changes in ALS, particularly UMN involvement . One of the key measurements provided by DTI is the fractional anisotropy (FA), which provides a scalar measurement of the degree of water diffusion . When the integrity of the white matter tracts is compromised by disease processes that interfere with water diffusion directionality, the FA is reduced . Over the past decade, a number of published studies have described decreases in the FA of the brain's corticospinal tract in ALS. However, the vast majority of the publications do not report the test accuracy of DTI to differentiate between diseased and nondiseased populations. In particular, the diagnostic value of DTI in patients presenting with possible or “early” signs of ALS is unknown. If the diagnostic test accuracy measures of this advanced neuroimaging technique are adequate, DTI could be used in the clinical workup of suspected ALS similar to electromyography. The purpose of this study was to aggregate the reported data across the different studies and to estimate summary diagnostic test accuracy measures of DTI in the diagnosis of ALS using standard meta-analysis techniques. Our secondary aims were to investigate study-specific sources of heterogeneity in test accuracy measures.

The vertical axis expresses study size, as measured by standard error (SE). Studies with larger standard errors have a wider confidence interval from smaller sample size. The graphed vertical line represents the observed mean AUC and the dashed lines represent the 95% confidence interval limits for the expected distribution for published studies. The points represent the observed distribution of the published studies. Visual inspection of the plot demonstrates the presence of publication bias, with many studies outside the 95% confidence interval limits. Further, the plot demonstrates that studies with smaller study size (ie, larger standard errors) have lower test performance (ie, AUC).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DiagnosticAccuracyUsingDiffusionTensorImagingintheDiagnosisofALS/5_1s20S1076633212002322.jpg)
