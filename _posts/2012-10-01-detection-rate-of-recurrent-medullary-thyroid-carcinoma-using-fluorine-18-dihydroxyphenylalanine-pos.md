## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis of published data about the diagnostic performance of  18 F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) in detecting recurrent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC).

## Materials and Methods

A comprehensive literature search of studies indexed in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases through January 2012 and regarding  18 F-DOPA PET or PET/CT in patients with suspected recurrent MTC was carried out. Pooled detection rates (DR) in per patient and per lesion analyses were calculated. A subanalysis considering serum levels of calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen, device used, and carbidopa pretreatment was also performed.

## Results

Eight studies including 146 patients with suspected recurrent MTC were included. The DRs of  18 F-DOPA PET and PET/CT in per patient and per lesion analyses were 66% and 71%, respectively. DRs significantly increased in patients with serum calcitonin ≥1000 ng/L (86%) and calcitonin doubling times <24 months (86%).

## Conclusions

Fluorine-18-DOPA PET and PET/CT may be useful functional imaging methods in detecting recurrent MTC. The DR of recurrent MTC using these imaging methods increases in patients with higher calcitonin levels and lower calcitonin doubling times.

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an uncommon neuroendocrine tumor that originates from parafollicular C cells and accounts for approximately 5% of thyroid tumors, occurring in either sporadic (75% of cases) or familial (25% of cases) forms. This tumor is frequently aggressive; the most frequent sites of metastatic disease are the cervical and thoracic lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone. The mainstay of treatment for MTC is surgical resection .

Serum calcitonin represents the most sensitive and accurate tumor marker in the postoperative management and surveillance of MTC. In about one third of patients with MTC lesions, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels may also be increased, and this finding has prognostic significance, because increased CEA levels are characteristic of advanced forms when the tumor tends toward dedifferentiation. Serum calcitonin and CEA doubling times are efficient tools for assessing tumor progression and are useful prognostic factors in patients with MTC . In the presence of a significant increase of serum calcitonin or CEA levels after surgery, the search for recurrent or metastatic disease by imaging is indicated . These imaging modalities include neck ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography (PET) with different radiopharmaceuticals, and bone scintigraphy .
