## Rationale and Objectives

Although contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging techniques such as harmonic imaging (HI) have evolved to reduce tissue signals using the nonlinear properties of the contrast agent, levels of background suppression have been mixed. Subharmonic imaging (SHI) offers near complete tissue suppression by centering the receive bandwidth at half the transmitting frequency. The aims of this study were to demonstrate the feasibility of three-dimensional (3D) SHI and to compare it to 3D HI.

## Materials and Methods

Three-dimensional HI and SHI were implemented on a Logiq 9 ultrasound scanner with a 4D10L probe. Four-cycle SHI was implemented to transmit at 5.8 MHz and receive at 2.9 MHz, while two-cycle HI was implemented to transmit at 5 MHz and receive at 10 MHz. The ultrasound contrast agent Definity was imaged within a flow phantom and the lower pole of two canine kidneys in both HI and SHI modes. Contrast-to-tissue ratios and rendered images were compared offline.

## Results

SHI resulted in significant improvement in contrast-to-tissue ratios relative to HI both in vitro (12.11 ± 0.52 vs 2.67 ± 0.77, _P_ < .001) and in vivo (5.74 ± 1.92 vs 2.40 ± 0.48, _P_ = .04). Rendered 3D subharmonic images provided better tissue suppression and a greater overall view of vessels in a flow phantom and canine renal vasculature.

## Conclusions

The successful implementation of SHI in 3D allows imaging of vascular networks over a heterogeneous sample volume and should improve future diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, 3D SHI provides improved contrast-to-tissue ratios relative to 3D HI.

Despite its advantages in cost, portability, and real-time nature, ultrasound suffers from low blood-to-tissue contrast relative to other imaging modalities. Segmentation of vascular formations from the surrounding tissue is clinically useful in a variety of radiologic applications. For example, malignant lesions often show a more tortuous, sporadic vascular network relative to benign lesions . This more chaotic growth pattern can often be quantified by the number of bifurcations , microvascular density , or fractal dimensionality as a means for differentiation of diseased from healthy tissue. Additionally, temporal parameters within the vasculature such as perfusion or filling time of intravenous contrast can also be used for the identification and classification of diseased tissue .

Although the feasibility of experimental, nanoscale agents has been demonstrated , clinically approved ultrasound contrast agents are small gas bubbles stabilized by an outer shell (generally composed of protein or phospholipids), with diameters ranging from 1 to 8 μm that constrain their distribution within the body to the blood supply . The differences in the compressibility and acoustical impedance of the gas cores within these microbubbles relative to the surrounding fluid (roughly 20,000× and 250×, respectively, for most gases) result in up to 30 dB of vascular enhancement . Numerous studies of the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound for lesion characterization have been reported, although results have been mixed , in part because of an inability to distinguish signals from the contrast agent, perfused within the microvasculature, and signals from the surrounding tissue.

represent the variance in the respective ROIs . In vitro CTRs were calculated from the ROIs as shown in  Figure 1 . The vessel ROI was selected as a square region of 45 to 55 pixels (approximately 20 mm  2 ) within the vessel lumen. Four equidistant, equal-sized tissue ROIs along the same horizontal and vertical axes as the vessel ROI were then selected and averaged together. This process was performed for each plane within the volume (45–50 slices/volume), for each volume over the 5-second period (9 to 11 volumes depending of volume acquisition rate). Final in vitro CTR was calculated as the average of three repetitions of 5-second acquisitions.
