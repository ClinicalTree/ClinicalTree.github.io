## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of hyperpolarized helium-3 magnetic resonance (MR)-based imaging markers in predicting future forced expiratory volume in one second decline/chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder progression in smokers compared to current diagnostic techniques.

## Materials and Methods

Total 60 subjects (15 nonsmokers and 45 smokers) participated in both baseline and follow-up visits (∼1.4 years apart). At both visits, subjects completed pulmonary function testing, a six-minute walk test , and the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire. Using helium-3 MR imaging, means (M) and standard deviations (H) of oxygen tension (P  A O  2 ), fractional ventilation, and apparent diffusion coefficient were calculated across 12 regions of interest in the lungs. Subjects who experienced FEV1 decline >100 mL/year were deemed “decliners,” while those who did not were deemed “sustainers.” Nonimaging and imaging prediction models were generated through a logistic regression model, which utilized measurements from sustainers and decliners.

## Results

The nonimaging prediction model included the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire total score, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide by the alveolar volume (DLCO/VA), and distance walked in a six-minute walk test. A receiving operating character curve for this model yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 68% with an overall area under the curve of 65%. The imaging prediction model generated following the same methodology included ADC  H , FV  H , and P  A O  2 H . The resulting receiving operating character curve yielded a sensitivity of 87.5%, specificity of 82.8%, and an area under the curve of 89.7%.

## Conclusion

The imaging predication model generated from measurements obtained during  3 He MR imaging is better able to predict future FEV1 decline compared to one based on current clinical tests and demographics. The imaging model's superiority appears to arise from its ability to distinguish well-circumscribed, severe disease from a more uniform distribution of moderately altered lung function, which is more closely associated with subsequent FEV1 decline.

## INTRODUCTION

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) is a progressive disease of the lungs in which obstructed airflow and destruction of the lung parenchyma cause disrupted and deteriorating lung function often accompanied by sputum production, dyspnea, and cough ( ). In 2015, 3.17 million deaths were attributed to COPD, accounting for nearly 5% of total global deaths ( ). COPD is typically diagnosed by assessing forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV  1 ) together with the presentation of associated symptoms; however, while tracking annual FEV  1 decline has been considered the most effective way to monitor COPD progression since the 1970s ( ), it has proven ineffective for predicting future lung function decline. In recent years, the hyperpolarized noble gases have been developed as MRI contrast agents capable of delivering images of gas distribution throughout all regions of the lung, which can be used to quantify lung function during ventilation and diffusion ( ). As a result, assessing gas distribution and heterogeneity in signal intensity throughout the lung now offers an alternative method for monitoring COPD progression with better prognostic potential. In this paper, we present a model for using  3 He MR imaging markers to predict functional decline in the lungs of smokers with high sensitivity and specificity.

To diagnose symptomatic COPD, physicians utilize GOLD criteria based on the ratio of a patient's FEV  1 to their forced vital capacity (FVC) after bronchodilator use ( ). After initial diagnosis (FEV  1 /FVC < 70%), disease progression is tracked via changes in percent predicted FEV  1 (%FEV  1 ), and is staged from GOLD 1 (≥80% predicted) to GOLD 4 (<30% predicted). Depending on the annual rate of FEV  1 decline, clinicians can then determine whether a smoker's lung function is declining rapidly (“decliner”) or at a rate consistent with normal aging (“sustainer”) ( ). However, because spirometric measurements cannot differentiate between decliners and sustainers until after a significant functional decline has already occurred, they represent a much better tool for confirming disease progression than for predicting future functional decline ( ).

Once the images were adjusted, the analysis of ADC, P A O 2 , and FV began with the binning of images into the 12 ROI's (binned voxels) of 500 cm 3 each.
