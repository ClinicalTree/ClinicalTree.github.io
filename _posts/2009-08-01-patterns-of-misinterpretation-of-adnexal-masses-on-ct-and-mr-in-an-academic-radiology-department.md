## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess potential quality assurance (QA) issues in the diagnosis and characterization of adnexal masses on pelvic computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies.

## Materials and Methods

Images from 128 women who had oophorectomies during a 16-month period with CT and/or MR studies within 5 years of surgery (145 CT scans from 103 women and 49 MR studies from 42 women, with 17 having both MR and CT studies) were reviewed by three radiologists who assigned QA scores of 0 (no QA issue), 1 (minor issue with minimal impact on clinical care), or 2 (major issue with potential impact on clinical care). The difficulty of diagnosis was assigned a score of 0 (very difficult diagnosis to make), 1 (difficult but possible to make the diagnosis), or 2 (diagnosis should be made). The incidence of adnexal QA issues was calculated using total CT and MR pelvic examinations performed on women during the interval.

## Results

Twenty-nine QA issues were identified in 28 women in 17 of 145 CT studies (11.7%) and 12 of 49 MR examinations (24.5%) in women having adnexal surgery (17 of 11,194 \[0.15%\] of female pelvic CT studies and 12 of 603 \[2.0%\] of female pelvic MR studies performed in the time interval). Issues included missed lesions, lesions misidentified as leiomyomas, fat described in the lesion but not seen histologically, postmenopausal status of patient not considered, ultrasound correlation not recommended, and confusion of right and left sides.

## Conclusion

Errors in CT and MR studies regarding the diagnosis and characterization of adnexal masses in a highly enriched population of women undergoing adnexal surgery are common. Knowledge of the types of QA issues found in CT and MR studies of adnexal masses should aid in decreasing future errors.

Ultrasound is the primary method for imaging adnexal masses, with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging often used as the secondary modality for further characterization of lesions seen on ultrasound. However, pelvic computed tomographic (CT) and MR studies performed for indications other than adnexal imaging often reveal adnexal pathology. Because adnexal lesions are not necessarily in the region of patients' symptoms, these lesions can be overlooked. In addition, the CT and MR appearance of specific types of adnexal lesions might not be well recognized by general radiologists, and therefore, appropriate follow-up of lesions might not be recommended.

Peer review is increasingly used by radiologists to obtain feedback and reduce errors in the interpretation of imaging studies. However, little analysis of data from peer review has been published, including peer review for pelvic imaging.

This was called a physiologic cyst, which was reasonable, because simple adnexal cysts are so common. However, the histologic diagnosis was metastatic colon cancer.
