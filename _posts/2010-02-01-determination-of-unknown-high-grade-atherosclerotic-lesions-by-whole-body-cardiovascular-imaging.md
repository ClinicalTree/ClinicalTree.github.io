## Rationale and Objectives

The long-term prospects for patients with peripheral-arterial-occlusive disease (PAOD) must be considered in the context of coexistent generalized atherosclerosis. We sought to determine the added clinical information of noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for detecting asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease in patients already at high risk.

## Materials and Methods

Eighty-four patients (64 men, mean age 66.2 ± 10.0 years, range 34–84 years) with suspected or known PAOD were examined using a comprehensive cardiovascular MRI protocol. Two experienced observers reviewed all MRIs for the presence of “relevant findings,” which were defined as pathology requiring immediate therapy or mid-term follow-up.

## Results

Assessment of cardiac structures and function in 84 study patients yielded new pathology in 40 (48%) patients, whereas cerebral imaging revealed new findings in 45 (54%) patients. Previously unsuspected vascular findings were evident in 46 (55%) patients. Using the information from the MRIs, in 54 (64%) of patients mid-term follow-up was required, whereas in 7 (8%) patients a change of therapy or immediate treatment was necessary.

## Conclusion

Whole-body cardiovascular MRI is able to detect symptomatic and unsuspected findings in patients with PAOD. This technique was able to detect several vascular abnormalities that necessitated immediate medical attention and intervention in patients already identified as high-risk patients and, therefore, may show an increasing impact to determine individual therapeutic and follow-up concepts.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and accounts for almost 17 million deaths annually. Nearly 80% of these deaths occur in developed countries, mainly as a result of the aging of the population . Ideally, in a patient with systemic atherosclerotic disease, besides management and medical treatment of atherosclerotic risk factors, all major sites of atherosclerotic manifestation should be addressed in order to improve clinical outcomes and quality of life.

A high absolute cardiovascular risk, as defined, for example, by the SCORE (systematic coronary risk evaluation) mortality risk table , requires drastic lifestyle changes and medical treatment of atherosclerotic risk factors, whereas patients at low to moderate risk are mainly advised to adhere to lifestyle modifications. Noninvasive vascular imaging may be used for identifying patients initially considered to have a low vascular risk but, after detecting asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease, to reconsider these patients as high vascular risk . Patients with a (recent) clinical manifestation of an atherosclerotic disease are already classified as high risk; however, noninvasive vascular imaging may be useful in detecting vascular abnormalities that necessitate immediate medical attention (eg, aortic aneurysms, carotid artery stenosis). Because of the generalized nature of atherosclerosis, the prevalence of asymptomatic vascular diseases is high in these patients . In those patients with significant coexisting disease, myocardial revascularization therapies may improve myocardial perfusion and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure; treatment of carotid stenoses permits survival with reduced incidence of stroke; renal artery angioplasty reduces the incidence of renal insufficiency and the need for dialysis and transplantation; and, finally, treatment of lower extremity arterial occlusive disease may improve quality of life and functional status, facilitate wound healing, and decrease amputation rates. In patients who are scheduled for surgical interventions, undetected accompanying atherosclerotic disease may largely affect the surgical outcome or dramatically increase perioperative complication rates .
