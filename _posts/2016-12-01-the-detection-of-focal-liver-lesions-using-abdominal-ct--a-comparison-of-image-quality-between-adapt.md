## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate image quality characteristics of abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans reconstructed with adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction V (ASIR-V) vs currently using applied adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR).

## Materials and Method

This institutional review board-approved study included 35 consecutive patients who underwent CT of the abdomen. Among these 35 patients, 27 with focal liver lesions underwent abdomen CT with a 128-slice multidetector unit using the following parameters: fixed noise index of 30, 1.25 mm slice thickness, 120 kVp, and a gantry rotation time of 0.5 seconds. CT images were analyzed depending on the method of reconstruction: ASIR (30%, 50%, and 70%) vs ASIR-V (30%, 50%, and 70%). Three radiologists independently assessed randomized images in a blinded manner. Imaging sets were compared to focal lesion detection numbers, overall image quality, and objective noise with a paired sample _t_ test. Interobserver agreement was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient.

## Results

The detection of small focal liver lesions (<10 mm) was significantly higher when ASIR-V was used when compared to ASIR ( _P_ <  0.001). Subjective image noise, artifact, and objective image noise in liver were generally significantly better for ASIR-V compared to ASIR, especially in 50% ASIR-V. Image sharpness and diagnostic acceptability were significantly worse in 70% ASIR-V compared to various levels of ASIR.

## Conclusion

Images analyzed using 50% ASIR-V were significantly better than three different series of ASIR or other ASIR-V conditions at providing diagnostically acceptable CT scans without compromising image quality and in the detection of focal liver lesions.

## Introduction

The increase in CT utilization has raised concerns of the increased risk of cancer from medical radiation exposures because organ doses with CT are often higher than those with other imaging tests . For this reason, radiation dose reduction in body CT has become a top priority . However, dose reduction must be balanced by an acceptable level of image quality, and above all, diagnostic accuracy. Excessive dose reduction can compromise diagnostic image quality for lesion identification owing to substantial increase in image noise . Lesion detection is also affected by tissue contrast and lesion size. Variable dose reduction techniques, such as tube current modulation, low tube voltage, and noise reduction filters, have been successfully implemented; most promising are the iterative reconstruction algorithms that have evolved beyond the traditional reconstruction method of filtered back projection (FBP) . The adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) technique is one of the most widely studied iterative reconstruction techniques providing clinically acceptable image quality with an estimated dose reduction in the range of 25%–40% . Currently, many radiologists and manufacturers offer this technology as a combination of classic FBP and 20%~40% ASIR because of quality problems such as artificial texture or blotchy appearance in a high percentage of iterative reconstruction used.

Model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR; Veo) has become available as a fully iterative method. MBIR uses a more complex system to predict optical factors, the noise of the system, X-ray physics and objects, and therefore offers considerably better image quality than FBP and ASIR, even at ultralow doses . However, because MBIR requires a long processing time, it has not been widely used yet in routine clinical practice . The recently developed adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-V (ASIR-V) is a hybrid technique; it includes an algorithm that takes into account the noise of the system (photon statistics and electronic noise), X-ray physics, and objects with omitting optical factors requiring long processing time. Therefore, ASIR-V has the potential for clinically feasible dose reduction with better image quality than conventional ASIR and a shorter imaging processing time than MBIR. So it is conceptually “Augmented ASIR” or “Simplified MBIR” .
