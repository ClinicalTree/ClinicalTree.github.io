## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of the study is to determine if transitional year program (TYP) requirements foster realization of standards of excellence and clinical relevance for future radiologists and to explore demographic and economic factors pertinent to TYPs.

## Materials and Methods

A list of accredited TYPs were obtained from the American Medical Association's Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Directory 2006–2007. Specialty distribution of TYP graduates was examined from statistics provided by the ACGME, and data from the 2007 Main Residency Match was analyzed. Data derived from a concurrent survey of the perception of the value of internship sent to all current radiology residents and fellows was assessed. The institutional costs of employing TYP interns versus physician assistants were also calculated.

## Results

Forty-one of the 125 TYPs lack residencies in internal medicine (IM), general surgery (GS), or both, and approximately two-third of these lack full medical school affiliation. The interns who will graduate from these 41 programs account for 103 of the 1,128 radiology residents in their post-graduate year 2. Despite the longest elective time offered in TYPs compared to conventional preliminary programs, current radiology trainees who had participated in preliminary IM or GS internships were more satisfied compared to trainees completing TYPs.

## Conclusions

The requirements of the transitional internship and compliance with them need to be carefully assessed to determine their efficacy. Despite the strong economic impetus for hiring TYP interns, the availability of open slots in existing preliminary programs in IM and GS, coupled with radiology residents' greater level of satisfaction with traditional over transitional internships, makes the existence of TYPs less compelling.

Medical school graduates seeking to enter specialties distinct from primary care must complete a mandated internship prior to joining their residency of choice. A majority of these residents match in preliminary programs in internal medicine (IM) and general surgery (GS) with a small minority pursuing pediatric internships. Since its inception in 1982, the transitional year internship has also become a popular alternative option for medical graduates for postgraduate year (PGY)-1 training ( ). Differences between conventional internships and transitional year programs (TYPs) involve organizational structure, opportunities for electives, and evaluation and oversight. Transitional internships are multidisciplinary, whereas conventional internships are predominantly confined within one specialty. Furthermore, TYP requirements allow for residents to take up to 8 weeks of electives in nonclinical patient care experiences, eg, research, administration, and computer science, which is generally not offered in conventional internships. TYPs afford a common pathway for subsequent training in many medical disciplines. Specific requirements are in large measure independent of the requirements of specialty board certification. To a greater extent than preliminary programs, TYPs take place in community hospitals, many of which do not have a close relationship with a medical school or university-based health center.

TYP positions are sought by medical school graduates who aspire to seek a residency in a wide array of specialties. Among all such trainees, prospective radiologists comprise the largest share ( ). The putative value of transitional year preparation for radiologists is that it is designed to provide a diverse clinical experience across an array of diseases which residents may expect to encounter later as diagnosticians. Hence, an optimal curriculum should include ward-based and outpatient experiences in both IM and GS. To this end, the Transitional Year Residency Review Committee (TYRRC), an arm of the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), has enumerated extensive requirements to accommodate the opportunity for broad clinical exposure. In that regard, some of the distinctive features of transitional year regulations are:

Of the 125 transitional year programs (TYPs), 41 programs lack endogenous residencies in either internal medicine (IM), general surgery (GS), or both. Of these 41 TYPs, 27 (66%) are not affiliated or have a limited affiliation with a medical school. A total of 389 intern positions are available within these 41 programs, with an estimated 103 specializing in radiology. These 103 residents represent approximately 9% of the 1,128 radiology residents in their post-graduate (PGY)-2 year.

A large number of positions in general surgery (GS) and internal medicine (IM) preliminary and categorical programs were unmatched or filled by foreign medical graduates during the 2007 match. The preliminary internship slots remaining unfilled by U.S. medical graduates outnumbered the 300 transitional year program (TYP) interns joining radiology residencies.

Economic Benefit of Employing Transitional Year Program (TYP) Interns Versus Physician Assistants (PAs)


Physician Assistant Intern Base Salary $86,214 $49,746 Fringe Benefits $19,829 $11,442 One Primary Caregiver (FTE) 1.3 2.0 Hours worked/week 44 70 PA:Intern Ratio with Normalized Work Hours 1.6 1.0 FTE PA:Intern Ratio with Normalized Work Hours 2.1 1.0 Total Cost $219,317 $122,375 Medicare Contribution $0 $122,375 Cost to Institution $219,317 $0

One primary caregiver, computed as one full-time equivalent (FTE), normalized for equivalent work hours is equal to either two interns or 2.1 PAs. The institutional expenditure for salary and fringe benefits for 2.1 PAs is $219,317 and for 2.0 TYP interns is $122,375. However, if TYP intern positions are within the cap set by Medicare, salaries and fringe benefits for TYP interns may be fully reimbursed.
