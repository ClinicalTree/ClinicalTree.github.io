## Rationale and Objectives

Diagnostic imaging is under-represented in medical curricula globally. Adaptive tutorials, online intelligent tutoring systems that provide a personalized learning experience, have the potential to bridge this gap. However, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness for learning about diagnostic imaging.

## Materials and Methods

We performed a randomized mixed methods crossover trial to determine the impact of adaptive tutorials on perceived engagement and understanding of the appropriate use and interpretation of common diagnostic imaging investigations. Although concurrently engaged in disparate blocks of study, 99 volunteer medical students (from years 1–4 of the 6-year program) were randomly allocated to one of two groups. In the first arm of the trial on chest X-rays, one group received access to an adaptive tutorial, whereas the other received links to an existing peer-reviewed Web resource. These two groups crossed over in the second arm of the trial, which focused on computed tomography scans of the head, chest, and abdomen. At the conclusion of each arm of the trial, both groups completed an examination-style assessment, comprising questions both related and unrelated to the topics covered by the relevant adaptive tutorial. Online questionnaires were used to evaluate student perceptions of both learning resources.

## Results

In both arms of the trial, the group using adaptive tutorials obtained significantly higher assessment scores than controls. This was because of higher assessment scores by senior students in the adaptive tutorial group when answering questions related to topics covered in those tutorials. Furthermore, students indicated significantly better engagement with adaptive tutorials than the Web resource and rated the tutorials as a significantly more valuable tool for learning.

## Conclusions

Medical students overwhelmingly accept adaptive tutorials for diagnostic imaging. The tutorials significantly improve the understanding of diagnostic imaging by senior students.

A basic understanding of diagnostic imaging is vital for undergraduate medical students . In fact, application of this knowledge is often expected from students in their first postgraduate year . Medical imaging both requires and informs knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathology and allows students to develop an understanding of the role of radiology in diagnostic medicine . Failure to develop basic radiology skills also has significant health care and economic implications. In the United States, up to 30% of imaging studies are reported to be ordered inappropriately . This places a huge burden on the health budget and often results in unnecessary harm to patients .

Despite its clear importance, radiology is visited only briefly in many medical curricula . Indeed, many medical students believe that there is insufficient teaching of diagnostic imaging . This situation is exacerbated by the lack of accepted standard guidelines and curriculum in radiology for medical students at our institution, throughout Australia, and in many other countries, including the United States. As an image-centric specialty, radiology is well placed to use digital and online teaching solutions as a means of increasing student exposure to the core elements of the discipline .

> I really liked this tutorial—it was well structured, went through many basic concepts and was very clear … The best features were the context/information sections, and how they were followed up with questions, which were then followed by diagrams with answers.

A Representative Selection of Open-Ended Questionnaire Responses on the Strengths of the Adaptive Tutorials as a Learning Resource


Comment Themes “I loved that the adaptive tutorial started from the basics of X-rays right through to the diagnosis and presentation of various case studies. It was a good balance of theory and practical. I also liked that there were mini tests with real X-ray pictures to ensure that we were learning correctly. I enjoyed the variety of case studies and believe they will be quite useful for diagnosing X-rays in the future.” EX, IN, FE “The adaptive tutorial supplied basic information needed to understand diagnostic imaging and tested this when continuing with the tutorial. The cases at the end were especially helpful after learning about imaging by providing some practical use of the information in scenarios.” EX, IN “The adaptive tutorial was quite interactive at times which made it more engaging, eg, when we had to answer questions. This was the most stimulating and interesting part, particularly when we had to place pins on specific areas in the X-rays–this was particularly helpful as it really checked whether or not we could understand and apply our knowledge about chest X-rays. The instant feedback is helpful as it allows you to learn.” IN, VI, FE “The order of the tutorial was great as it was useful to have the basics taught before moving on to interpreting the chest X-rays. The visuals were great and complemented the text well.” UI, VI

EX, helpful explanations; FE, feedback; IN, interactivity; UI, effective user interface; VI, visual learning experience.
