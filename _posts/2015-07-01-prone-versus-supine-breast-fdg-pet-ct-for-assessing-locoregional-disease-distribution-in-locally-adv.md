## Rationale and Objectives

Prone  18 F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) may have advantages for breast imaging because of improved separation of deep anatomic structures. There are limited data on whether prone and supine FDG-PET/CT provide similar information regarding breast and axillary disease in the setting of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). The purpose of this study was to compare the information on locoregional disease distribution provided by prone versus supine FDG-PET in newly diagnosed LABC.

## Materials and Methods

In an Institutional Review Board-approved prospective trial, 24 patients with newly diagnosed LABC underwent both supine and prone FDG-PET/CT at the same scanning session. Three readers performed an independent review of all scans and categorized the locoregional disease distribution as breast only (BO)-unifocal, BO-multifocal, BO-multicentric, or breast + axillary involvement. For breast + axillary disease, the readers also assessed the number of involved axillary lymph nodes. Interobserver discrepancies were resolved at a consensus reading session.

## Results

Two scanning sessions were excluded because the prone scan had omitted part of the axilla from the field of view. In the remaining 22 patients, the consensus categorization of anatomic disease distribution was concordant between prone and supine scanning in 21 patients (linear kappa 0.91, 95% confidence interval \[0.79–1\]). In the 16 patients with breast + axillary disease, equal numbers of involved lymph nodes were identified on prone and supine scanning in 12 patients, whereas in the remaining four patients, prone scanning resulted in a higher number of visualized lymph nodes.

## Conclusions

Prone and supine FDG-PET/CT provided statistically identical information on locoregional disease distribution in LABC. However, prone scanning may perform better than supine for assessing the number of involved lymph nodes. Prone FDG-PET/CT may be useful in future clinical and research efforts, including hybrid PET–magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications.

## Introduction

18 F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is useful for the initial staging of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and for restaging breast cancer in the setting of recurrence . FDG-PET is typically performed with the patient in the supine position, but some initial studies have suggested that prone scanning may be more effective in breast cancer because of better separation of deep breast tissue, axillary, and chest wall structures . The recent introduction of hybrid PET–magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners provides additional motivation for studying prone FDG-PET of the breast, as breast MRI is currently performed with the patient in the prone position, prone FDG-PET may achieve better anatomic correlation with prone breast MRI in hybrid imaging applications .

At present, there are limited data on whether prone FDG-PET provides the same information as supine FDG-PET on locoregional disease distribution in breast cancer. Although FDG-PET does not currently play a major role in the clinical assessment of tumor multifocality or axillary nodal staging, these are areas in which FDG-PET performance may improve and new FDG-PET indications may emerge, especially with the evolution of higher spatial resolution positron emission mammography and hybrid PET-MRI systems . We therefore undertook this study to compare the information offered by prone versus supine FDG-PET in the context of newly diagnosed LABC. We investigated differences between prone and supine scanning in (1) qualitative categorization of the anatomic distribution of disease and (2) assessment of the number of involved axillary lymph nodes.
