## Rationale and Objectives

Delays between order and magnetic resonance (MR) exam often result when using the conventional paper-based MR safety screening process. The impact of an electronic MR safety screening process imbedded in a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system was evaluated.

## Materials and Methods

Retrospective chart review of 4 months of inpatient MR exam orders and reports was performed before and after implementation of electronic MR safety documentation. Time from order to MR exam completion, time from MR exam completion to final radiology report, and time from first order to final report were analyzed by exam anatomy. Length of stay (LOS) and date of service within the admission were also analyzed.

## Results

We evaluated 1947 individual MR orders in 1549 patients under an institutional review board exemption and a waiver of informed consent. Implementation of the electronic safety screening process resulted in a significant decrease of 1.1 hours (95% confidence interval 1.0–1.3 hours) in the mean time between first order to final report and a nonsignificant decrease of 0.8 hour in the median time from first order to exam end. There was a 1-day reduction ( _P_ = .697) in the time from admission to the MR exam compared to the paper process. No significant change in LOS was found except in neurological intensive care patients imaged within the first 24 hours of their admission, where a mean 0.9-day decrease was found.

## Conclusion

Benefits of an electronic process for MR safety screening include enabling inpatients to have decreased time to MR exams, thus enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment and reduced LOS.

Time to completion of inpatient magnetic resonance (MR) imaging exams was thought to prolong the inpatient length of stay (LOS) in our hospital . While this is a multifactorial problem, completion of the conventional paper MR Safety Screening Form was identified to cause delays. Specific activities contributing to these delays included neglecting to complete the paper form, forgetting to fax the completed form to radiology, and changes in the hospital service so the original ordering provider is no longer available to answer questions about the patient. The desire to improve safety with a patient-level overview of implant, medical, and surgical history motivated imbedding the MR safety screening process into the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) and requiring completion before placing the MR exam order. We also sought to reduce the time to the final report and hopefully enable earlier care decisions and treatment implementation, as well as improve patient outcomes .

To date, there have been no published reports of an electronic implementation of the MR safety screening process. Here, we describe the observed impact of creating an electronic replacement for the standard paper screening method in the inpatient care environment. We hypothesized that the electronic MR safety screening would result in decreased time from order to MR exam completion and decreased time from first order to final report.

Preimplementation (Nov–10) and postimplementation (Apr, May, Jun–11) times are compared. A significant increase in report turnaround time for abdominal exams (independent of implementation of the electronic MR screening tool) was found to adversely impact both the overall and the abdominal time from first order to final report.

Preimplementation (Nov–10) and postimplementation (Apr, May, Jun–11) times are compared. A significant increase in report turnaround time was found for abdominal exams; this was reviewed and found to be independent of the electronic MR screening tool implementation. Small increases were also found for chest exam reports. Both of these increases caused increases in the time from first order to final report.
