## Rationale and Objectives

With rapid scientific and technological advancements in radiological research, there is renewed emphasis on promoting early research training to develop researchers who are capable of tackling the hypothesis-driven research that is typically funded in contemporary academic research enterprises. This review article aims to introduce radiology residents to the abundant radiology research opportunities available to them and to encourage early research engagement among trainees.

## Materials and Methods

To encourage early resident participation in radiology research, we review the various research opportunities available to trainees spanning basic, clinical, and translational science opportunities to ongoing research in information technology, informatics, and quality improvement research.

## Conclusions

There is an incredible breadth and depth of ongoing research at academic radiology departments across the country, and the material presented herein aspires to highlight both subject matter and opportunities available to radiology residents eager to engage in radiologic research. The opportunities for interested radiology residents are as numerous as they are broad, spanning the basic sciences to clinical research to informatics, with abundant opportunities to shape our future practice of radiology.

Medical imaging—comprising computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques, among others—has become an indispensible clinical tool . With the advent and introduction of these new imaging technologies over the past 30 years, much of radiology research was focused on the modality-specific imaging features of disease. Although the importance of this descriptive research was critical to the development and maturation of these new imaging modalities, imaging and our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of disease have since become much more nuanced and sophisticated. In recognition of this, there has been a concerted effort by academic departments and the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) to promote early research training to develop researchers who are capable of tackling the hypothesis-driven research that is typically funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) .

To this end, the late 1990s and the early 2000s saw the development of several measures to spur the participation and development of radiologists in radiologic- and imaging-based research including the formation of the American Board of Radiology (ABR) Holman Pathway for training radiologists as basic and clinical research scientists, the launching of the Revitalizing the Radiology Research Enterprise by the RSNA, and capped by the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH in 2000. Despite these and ongoing efforts of academic radiology departments, academic radiology leadership (through the Society of Chairmen of Academic Radiology Departments), and clinical educators, resident participation has not significantly increased in the intervening time even with research and scholarly activity comprising an important component of the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education Next Accreditation System Milestone Project . To address this disconnect, it is imperative that radiology residents and fellows are made better aware of what contemporary research questions and directions exist in radiology research and the tools available to starting tackling these questions today.

A measured first step toward recruiting and training radiologic researchers is ensuring that trainees are aware of the abundant research opportunities available to them. Efforts to engage residents in contemporary research range from programmatic approaches that incorporate formal research tracks or NIH research training programs (eg, T32 programs) into residency programs to less-structured and informal research opportunities scattered throughout training. Numerous funding opportunities to provide residents the resources to pursue radiologic research are also widely available. These range from institutional seed grants, research grants from the RSNA (including both basic science and educational grants), grants and research sponsorship from the AUR to grants from the industrial sector (General Electric, Siemens and other) and other allied academic societies (eg, American Heart Association and American College of Medical Quality). As the accessibility and application of medical imaging grow, the importance of nourishing physician investigators trained in the radiologic sciences is increasingly important and highlights how critical opportunities and funding for radiology research, especially at the resident level, are toward realizing that today's research is tomorrow's practice .
