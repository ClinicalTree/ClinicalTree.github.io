The second edition of the _Pocket Atlas of Radiographic Positioning_ is one of a three-volume set that also includes the _Pocket Atlas of Radiographic Anatomy_ and the _Pocket Atlas of Sectional Anatomy_ . The book covers conventional imaging of the skull, spine, upper and lower extremities, chest, abdomen, breasts, and gastrointestinal tract. Angiographic exams, interventional exams, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also included. The MRI and CT chapters are new in the second edition, and the chapter on mammography has been expanded.

The book is coauthored by Drs Torsten Moeller and Emil Reif, of the Department of Radiology at Caritas Hospital in Dillingen, Germany, with collaboration from several additional authors. The book was originally written in German and has been translated to English. Some of the wording is unusual, and several projection names and positioning methods are unfamiliar (eg, the Clementschitsch method for the mandible, the Altschul method for the petrous ridges). Positioning instructions also use terms and abbreviations not commonly used in the United States. “Finger breadth” is used in many projections throughout the text to describe centering points or cassette placement. This term is both unfamiliar and imprecise. Additional editing to replace the awkward translations is desirable.

Despite translation and terminology issues, the text is well organized, with all information for each position concisely presented. The images chosen for the routine radiographic studies are well positioned, and superimposed lines have been drawn to help identify pertinent anatomy. Additional sketches assist in the visualization of proper positioning, and the “Tips and Tricks” sections provide practical information to make exams easier.

The chapters on the gastrointestinal tract, intravenous studies, angiography, CT, and MRI do not include images of all anatomic areas, nor are sketches provided to illustrate patient positioning. The CT and MRI chapters do, however, include imaging protocols and illustrations of anatomic boundaries for specific exams.

Overall, the second edition of the _Pocket Atlas of Radiographic Positioning_ provides detailed information that will assist radiographers in performing and evaluating a broad spectrum of radiographic procedures. The size of the book (378 pages, weighing 1.2 pounds) prevents it from truly being a “pocket” atlas, but it would serve as a good desk reference.
