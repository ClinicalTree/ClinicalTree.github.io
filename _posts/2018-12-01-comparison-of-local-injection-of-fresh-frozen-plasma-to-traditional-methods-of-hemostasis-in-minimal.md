## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate different techniques for reducing hemorrhagic complications in coagulopathic patients with elevated international normalized ratio having an image-guided percutaneous invasive procedure; techniques included systemic transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), local injection of FFP, percutaneous injection of gelatin sponge, and percutaneous placements of angiographic coils.

## Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of 232 consecutive patients with known coagulopathy undergoing image-guided minimally invasive procedures were selected. Ninety-one patients had local FFP injected, 40 patients underwent local synthetic gelatin injection, 16 patients had percutaneous coil embolization, and 85 patients received systemic FFP. The number of bleeds, complications related to bleeds, and systemic complications were recorded. A 30 cc threshold was used to delineate significant bleeding.

## Results

No patients experienced clinically significant or insignificant bleeding with local FFP injection ( _P_ value <.05). Other local hemostatic methods (Gelfoam, systemic FFP, and coil embolization) were associated with higher levels of bleeding (12.5%, 17.1%, 37.5%, respectively) and complications (7.5%, 31.4%, 37.5%, respectively). Systemic FFP infusion was associated with respiratory, infectious, and mortal complications.

## Conclusions

Local injection of blood products provides a safe and efficacious hemostatic agent to reduce the incidence of postprocedural bleeding. The technique is associated with lower rates of bleeding and systemic complications when compared to other local and systemic techniques. Further randomized prospective studies with a larger patient cohort need to be performed to corroborate these initial findings.

## Introduction

Patients presenting with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) or other clotting factor abnormalities are at risk of bleeding when undergoing a variety of procedures, and this bleeding may be difficult to detect . Bleeding can present a unique problem to interventional radiologists as the minimally invasive nature of the procedures precludes direct visualization of bleeding and subsequent hemostatic maneuvers possible in open surgical procedures. Bleeding from interventional procedures can present insidiously and unexpectedly . Percutaneous biopsies of solid organs can result in high major bleeding rates in patients with an elevated INR . It is therefore important for clinicians to know methods to mitigate risk and provide procedures to patients with coagulopathy.

Traditionally, risk remediation in patients with elevated INR is performed with intravenous infusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), which helps reverse elevated INR values by providing systemic clotting factors. This approach may not mitigate significant bleeding risk, as studies have shown large volume transfusions have no significant effect on bleeding outcomes . Large volume infusions carry the risk of transfusion-related reactions, infections, and volume overload, especially in patients with significant comorbidities such as congestive heart disease . The cost of blood products can be more substantial when given in larger volumes and when added to the cost of testing patient compatibility . Despite the narrow indications for FFP, there is widespread use of FFP largely attributed to procedural preparation .
