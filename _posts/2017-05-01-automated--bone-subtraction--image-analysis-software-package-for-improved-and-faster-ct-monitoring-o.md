## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to assess the diagnostic benefit of a novel computed tomography (CT) post-processing software generating subtraction maps of longitudinal non-enhanced CT examinations for monitoring the course of myeloma bone disease in the spine.

## Materials and Methods

The local institutional review board approved the retrospective data evaluation. Included were 82 consecutive myeloma patients (46 male; mean age, 65.08 ± 9.76) who underwent 188 repeated whole-body reduced-dose Multislice Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT) at our institution between December 2013 and January 2016. Lytic bone lesions were categorized as new or enlarging versus stable. Bone subtraction maps were read in combination with corresponding 1-mm source images comparing results to those of standard image reading of 5-mm axial and 2-mm multiplanar reformat reconstructions (MPR) scans and hematologic markers, and classified as either progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD or remission). The standard of reference was 1-mm axial CT image reading + hematologic response both confirmed at follow-up. For statistical purposes, we subgrouped the hematologic response categories similarly to those applied for CT imaging (progression vs stable/response).

## Results

According to the standard of reference, 16 patients experienced PD and 66 SD at follow-up. Th sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for axial 5 mm + 2 mm MPR image versus bone subtraction maps in a “lesion-by-lesion” reading were 97.6%, 92.3%, and 97.2% versus 97.8%, 96.7%, and 97.7%, respectively. The use of bone subtraction maps resulted in a change of response classification in 9.7% of the patients ( _n_ = 8) versus 5 mm + 2 mm MPR image reading from SD to PD. Bone sclerosis lesions were detected in 52 out of 82 patients (63.4%). The reading time was significantly lower with the software bone subtraction compared to standard reading ( _P_ < 0.01) and 1-mm image reading ( _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusion

Accuracy of bone subtraction maps reading for monitoring multiple myeloma is slightly increased over that of conventional axial + MPR image reading and significantly speeds up the reading time.

## Introduction

Multiple myeloma is a malignant hematologic disease of mature B cells with an often guarded prognosis. The disease is characterized by an overproduction of monoclonal immunoglobulins or light-chain molecules. One major feature is myeloma bone disease (MBD), which manifests as focal or diffuse generalized bone destruction. A misbalance of osteoblasts and osteoclasts function results in an overall increased osteoclast activity and subsequent bone resorption as well as disabled osteoblasts . As a consequence, these osteolyses do not heal in the majority of patients .On first diagnosis, almost 80% of the patients with multiple myeloma present with lytic bone lesions , which due to an often high number and small size can pose a challenge for radiological detection. In particular at follow-up and during treatment, the determination of MBD progression can be time-consuming and potentially inaccurate.

In the last decades, post-processing techniques, such as multiplanar reconstructions and the use of thin-slice reconstructions, significantly improved lesion detection. In multiple myeloma, typically the axial skeleton is involved first as the disease predominates in regions of predominant red marrow. Typically, myeloma first involves the bone marrow, which follows bone destruction as the tumor nests enlarge and the dense trabecular architecture of the cancellous bone limits their expansion. Before bone destruction becomes evident on radiographs or even computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging proves superior for the detection of infiltrative medullary lesions. Nevertheless, CT can provide helpful information during or after therapy, specifically for the detection of residual abnormalities, which are concerning for localized relapse . Although many myeloma patients can be monitored reliably with hematologic parameters such as M-gradient, the non-secretory group of patients does not secrete paraproteins and is therefore difficult to monitor. In this group of patients, imaging plays an important diagnostic role. Moreover, progression of MBD is often not affected by chemotherapy even in responding patients . For this reason, the detection of changes occurring in the axial skeleton at follow-up is critical for accurate assessment of progressive disease. CT is the most accurate technique for imaging assessment of bone. Several new techniques have been tested in the last years with the goal to increase detection of bone changes during disease surveillance. Some researchers applied automatic detection of bone metastases in the thoracolumbar spine and visualization of bone metastases with maximum intensity projection and surface-shaded display techniques . In a small animal myeloma model, Evans et al. tested a fully automatic image analysis method created to detect osteolyses in the cortical bone of the tibia .
