## Rationale and Objectives

Diffusion tensor imaging has been used to characterize tumor heterogeneity and invasion in human glioblastoma. Recently, higher order diffusion tensors have been proposed as solutions to errors associated with diffusion tensor imaging estimates of complex microstructures. The purpose of the current study was to examine higher order diffusion characteristics in human glioblastoma prior to surgical resection using the fourth-order diffusion tensor model.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma participated in the study. Diffusion-weighted images were collected in 21 directions. The second-order (traditional) and fourth-order diffusion tensors were calculated and compared in regions of contrast enhancement, T2 signal abnormality, and normal-appearing white matter.

## Results

Orientation distribution functions were strikingly different between the two tensor models, particularly in regions with tumor heterogeneity and/or regions of suspected tumor invasion. Image contrast was significantly higher in fourth-order scalar measures compared to second-order scalars. Results of particular eigenvalues and scalars using the fourth-order tensor showed differences between T2 abnormal regions and contrast enhancement, whereas second-order eigenvalues and scalars did not show differences. This suggests that higher order diffusion images could potentially be more sensitive to tumor invasion.

## Conclusions

These results suggest that the fourth-order diffusion tensor has the ability to add value to second-order (traditional) diffusion tensor imaging in the evaluation of glioblastoma.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are highly sensitive to the underlying microstructural characteristics of biologic tissues. This sensitivity to subvoxel, microscopic features has helped provide insight into many physiologic changes that occur as a result of brain tumor growth and invasion, such as cerebral edema , hypoxia , the increase in diffusion observed after successful radiotherapy due to cell breakdown , and the change in diffusion characteristics resulting from increasing tumor cellularity and invasion . Additionally, diffusion magnetic resonance characteristics have been shown to be predictive and prognostic biomarkers in new brain tumor therapeutics and have shown utility in histopathologic grading of gliomas .

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) involves the addition of directional encoding to diffusion measurements, allowing novel structural information about the microenvironment to be acquired. For example, in normal tissues, DTI typically shows high diffusion anisotropy within tightly packed white matter fiber bundles because of diffusion restriction perpendicular to axon fibers. This high degree of diffusion anisotropy within white matter regions provides the basis for DTI tractography , in which pseudoaxonal tracts are “grown” from seed regions placed within white matter tracts. For relatively simple tissue structures, such as the thick white matter bundle within the corpus callosum, the “traditional” diffusion tensor model may be an adequate representation of the general tissue architecture. For more complex tissues, “nontraditional” diffusion models may be beneficial.

Where _m_ tissue is the average measurement within the tissue, and σ is the standard deviation of the background image noise. Last, a repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare diffusion measurements among each of the ROIs outlined above (ie, tumor, peritumor, and NAWM). Tukey's test for multiple comparisons test was used if the ANOVA showed statistical significance.

![Figure 1, Traditional and fourth-order orientation distribution functions (ODFs) in glioblastoma. (a) Region of the corpus callosum suspect of tumor infiltration according to fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal abnormality and mass effect. The second-order tensor (left) shows regions of high anisotropy indicative of normal white matter tissue; however, fourth-order tensor shows more complex changes that may indicate invasion. For example, the voxel in (a) appears relatively normal according to the traditional tensor but is quite complex, as shown in (b). (b) These differences are more pronounced when examining second-order and fourth-order ODFs within a highly heterogeneous, contrast-enhancing tumor. Similarly, voxels in (c) represented by the second-order tensor are relatively similar to surrounding tissues; however, when examining the fourth-order tensor (d), the ODF is more complex.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/HighOrderDiffusionTensorImaginginHumanGlioblastoma/0_1s20S1076633211001589.jpg)
