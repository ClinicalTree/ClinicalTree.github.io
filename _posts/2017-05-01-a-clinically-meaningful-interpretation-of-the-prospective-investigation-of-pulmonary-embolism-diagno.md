## Rationale and Objectives

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Diagnostic test characteristics reported in terms of sensitivity and specificity are difficult to translate at the clinical level. More relevant measures are likelihood ratios (LRs), which can convert a pretest into a posttest probability. The aim of our study was to calculate the LRs and posttest probabilities for multiple-level test result for ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scintigraphy and for perfusion scintigraphy combined with chest radiography using modified Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II and the Prospective Investigative Study of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PISAPED) criteria for each clinical probability level for the most commonly used clinical prediction rules (CPR) using the PIOPED data.

## Materials and Methods

PE pretest probability was estimated for the most commonly used CPRs (Wells, Geneva, Miniati, and Charlotte) at each clinical probability level (two-, three-, and four-level). Multiple-level LRs (high, indeterminate, low, very low probability, and normal) and the positive, indeterminate, and negative results for V/Q scintigraphy, and the positive, indeterminate, and negative results for perfusion scintigraphy were generated and used to calculate posttest probabilities based on the sensitivity and specificity data from PIOPED for each clinical probability level (low, intermediate, and high) for each CPR. Nomograms were also created.

## Results

The LRs for a positive V/Q and perfusion scintigraphy test using modified PIOPED II and PISAPED criteria were 20.6, 11, and 23.7, and for a negative test result were 0.15, 0.16, and 0.2, respectively. In the three-level Wells score, the posttest probability for an initial low clinical probability PE for a positive, indeterminate, and negative test result, respectively, for V/Q scintigraphy is 56, 5, and 0.9; for perfusion scintigraphy with modified PIOPED 40, 7, and 0.9, and with PISAPED 59, not available (N/A), and 1.2; for an initial moderate clinical probability PE for V/Q scintigraphy 86, .22, and 4; for perfusion scintigraphy with modified PIOPED 77, 26, and 5, and with PISAPED 88, N/A, and 6; for an initial high clinical probability of PE for V/Q scintigraphy 95, 48, and 13; and for perfusion scintigraphy with modified PIOPED 92, 53, and 13, and with PISAPED 96, N/A, and 16.

## Conclusions

With LRs >10, a positive test result for V/Q and perfusion scintigraphy can confirm the presence of PE. Only a normal test result has low enough LR to exclude PE.

## Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death, after myocardial ischemia and stroke . Prompt and accurate diagnosis of PE has been shown to greatly influence patient outcome . Clinical assessment of the probability of PE is a crucial step in contemporary diagnostic strategies because the correct interpretation of test results depends on it. From Bayes theorem, the probability of PE after testing depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the test but also on the clinical probability before testing. Current recommendations from the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) II investigators, Fleischner Society, European Society of Cardiology, and others for the investigation of suspected acute PE recommend that clinical assessment should be performed in each patient suspected of having PE before any laboratory testing or imaging is performed so that the clinical probability of the disease can be determined . Clinical assessment should be made with an objective method and the use of clinical prediction rules (CPRs) is strongly recommended .

Within the last two decades, many different CPRs have been described. The most widely used CPR is the Wells (Canadian) rule. However, one of the main criticisms of the Wells score is the inclusion of the clinician's implicit assessment as to whether an alternative diagnosis is more likely than PE, an item that carries significant weight but is a subjective parameter and demonstrates poor interobserver reproducibility . Efforts were made to develop entirely objective scores, such as the Geneva (Wicki), Charlotte, and Miniati (Pisa) rules . Three scoring systems (Wells score, Geneva score, and Pisa score) have been tested prospectively and validated in large clinical trials. All three scoring systems perform reasonably well in outpatients and emergency departments . The Pisa score is more optimized for use in inpatients . In the last decade, the most used rules were modified to increase their usefulness and acceptability for clinicians. Cutoff scores of the three-level rules that stratified patients into three levels of clinical probability (low, intermediate, or high) were modified to obtain two-level rules classifying patients in only two categories (“PE likely/unlikely” for the Wells score or “safe/unsafe” for the Charlotte rule) (  Table 1 ).
