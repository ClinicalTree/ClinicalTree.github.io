This is one of Elsevier's popular _Problem Solving in Radiology_ book series, compiled by two well-recognized experts in the field of cardiovascular imaging. The text is organized into five sections. The first section systematically reviews the technical aspects of the various imaging modalities, including echocardiography, catheter angiography, multidetector computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radionuclide imaging, and vascular ultrasound and provides a logical framework for selecting the most optimum imaging test. This is followed by a comprehensive illustrative review of cardiovascular anatomy within the different imaging modalities. The third section focuses on the imaging appearance and complications of cardiovascular devices. After this general discussion, the imaging spectrum of different disease entities that affect the cardiovascular system are reviewed in detail, with a special emphasis on the multimodality imaging appearance of the diseases, role of imaging in problem solving, and differential diagnostic considerations.

There is an armamentarium of beautifully selected and carefully annotated images within each section, some of which are accompanied by complementary colored illustrations. Useful tips, imaging pitfalls, and valuable teaching points are organized into user-friendly tables and boxes. In addition to the text and illustrations, there is complimentary online access to regularly updated web content, which will ensure that readers can keep track of continuing advances in this evolving and exciting field.

_Problem Solving in Radiology: Cardiovascular Imaging_ is an excellent reference and day-to-day source for physicians, residents, fellows, and others interested in understanding the applications, techniques, and interpretive diagnostic nuances of cardiovascular imaging.
