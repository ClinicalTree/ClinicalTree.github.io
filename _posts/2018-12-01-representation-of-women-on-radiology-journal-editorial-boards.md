## Rationale and Objectives

We examined female representation on editorial boards of four prominent radiology journals. We compared editorial board representation to female academic radiology career advancement and the proportion of female authorship in three journals over four decades.

## Methods

We collected data on the gender of editorial board members as listed on mastheads of _Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), Academic Radiology_ , and the _Journal of the American College of Radiology_ in 5-year intervals plus the most recent year available (1973–2017), and the gender of their editors-in-chief for all years since each journal's inception. We compared _Radiology, AJR_ , and _Academic Radiology_ data to published data on gender of the journals' authors, all US medical students, and academic radiologists over time.

## Results

Gender was determined for 171 editors-in-chief (100%) and 2139 (100%) editorial board members listed in the selected journals for each of the study years. The proportion of women on editorial boards increased from 1.4% (1 of 69) in 1978 to 18.8% (73 of 388) in 2013 ( _P_ < .001), but remained below the proportion of female first authors (7.5% in 1978 and 27.1% in 2013) and female faculty in radiology (11.5% in 1978 and 28.1% in 2013). None of the four general radiology journals had a female editor-in-chief during the study period.

## Conclusions

Female representation on editorial boards has increased over time, but still lags behind increases seen in female first authorship in radiology journals and radiology faculty appointments over the last four decades. There was no female editor-in-chief during the study period.

## Introduction

Medical journal editorial board appointments, including becoming editor-in-chief, are indicators of professional achievement and are often influenced by research and national leadership prominence. Editors, reviewers, and authors have influence over the scientific community and, therefore, lead the direction of scientific advancement and health policy . Academic advancement and leadership roles in medicine are important to career fulfillment and impact, but historically have been obtained by more men than women, raising concern for gender bias .

While women in leadership positions are important role models for younger women , recent studies suggest that the higher the leadership rank, the fewer the women. For example, a 1994 study of editors-in-chief of 100 high-impact-factor clinical medicine journals found only four women and suggested that lack of female role models and gender bias were potential causes for this gender gap . In 2015, section heads and vice chairs of academic radiology departments were three times more likely to be male, and 91% of departmental chairpersons were male .

Correlation coefficient (r) and _P_ values in parentheses displayed above were used to examine the presence of correlation between female editors, authors, medical students, faculty in radiology, and radiology department chairs over time. We transformed the proportions of women each year into logs of odds and then used Pearson correlations. A _P_ value <.05 was considered a significant correlation.
