## Highlights

- DBT use has continued to grow over the course of 2011–2016.

- DBT use is now equally likely at academic centers versus in private practices.

- Synthetic 2D has yet to replace conventional 2D for DBT interpretation.

- Majority of DBT users do not currently perform DBT-guided procedures.

- DBT remains a limited resource (40% 1 unit only), likely impacting usage.

![Figure 2, Reported time to read a digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) study (minutes) versus duration of use (years). There was a weak but statistically significant ( P < 0.001) Spearman rank correlation ( r = −0.18) between the time to read DBT and the length of DBT use, implying that the time to read tends to decline with continued DBT use.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DigitalBreastTomosynthesisPracticePatternsFollowing2011FDAApproval/1_1s20S1076633217300132.jpg)
