Survey research is appealing to many clinical researchers, including radiologists. Emerging interest in patient preferences and patient-centered outcomes related to imaging likely will stimulate additional use of questionnaires in our field. However, like other quantitative methods, survey-based research requires meticulous planning, execution, and analysis to generate reliable results and support meaningful conclusions. The purpose of this review is to provide a guideline for radiologists embarking on this type of research, with attention to questionnaire design, sampling, survey administration, and analysis.

## Introduction

Survey research appeals to many academic radiologists. On the surface, these projects seem quick, inexpensive, and relatively simple. In the age of e-mail, social media, and smartphones, the broad potential reach and clickable immediacy of a questionnaire are attractive. However, the perception that “anyone can do it” and the rush to push “send” may contribute to flawed data and inappropriate conclusions .

Survey research should be approached with the same rigor and planning as other quantitative research methods . In fact, survey research is itself an entire academic discipline within social science. Although abundant throughout the medical literature, most medical professionals lack formal training in this area .

A point about terminology: a survey, in its pure sense, is a sampling of any value from a larger population, whereas a questionnaire is a tool often used in survey research that consists of a series of written or verbal questions. Therefore, although “survey” and “questionnaire” often are interchangeably used, they are not synonymous. Examples of survey research that do not include a questionnaire might include samples of blood pressure values, heights, or test scores. For the purposes of this manuscript, we will be focusing on questionnaire-based survey research.

Reliable survey research requires substantial forethought to refine the scientific question, design the survey instrument, select and engage the appropriate population, and analyze the data. This review outlines the steps in designing and implementing a questionnaire-based study. The process is broken down into its key components in  Figure 1 . The purpose of this review is to provide a stepwise guideline for radiologists embarking on this type of research.

TABLE 1


Pearls and Pitfalls for Questionnaire-based Studies Conducted by Radiologists


Phase of Study Pearls Pitfalls Developing the construct Establish a clear vision of the purpose of the project Proceed to questionnaire design without developing a research question Define important outcomes in advance Questionnaire design Engage statistician early in the process Overlapping answer options Use validated instruments when available Noncontiguous answer options Build redundant items around important concepts to confirm internal validity “Stacked” questions within one stem Pilot the questionnaire Double negatives Difficult hypothetical questions Keep questions at an 8th grade reading level or below Intimate questions without regard for respondent privacy Sampling Identify target population Use convenience sample without considering implications Define method of sampling, considering all options Know your population and obstacles to survey completion Compare sample demographics to target population Data collection Consider implications of mode of survey administration Use the quickest and cheapest method without regard for population characteristics Use institutional resources to assist in data collection Assume clerks, technicians, or clinical colleagues will be motivated to consent patients and collect questionnaires Pay modest incentives to boost response rate Use reminders to boost response rate Publish questionnaire without pilot-testing the method of administration Data analysis Carefully oversee data entry and coding steps Make conclusions before comparing sample to target population Spend time on descriptive analysis and “get to know” your data Ignore missing data and haphazardly include or exclude patients Assess for missing data, create a formal analysis plan, and report it Perform multiple hypothesis tests without statistical significance correction Inference Present results in the context of prior literature Make bold claims without reference to relevant prior research or considering limitations Provide appropriate confidence intervals for results Consider potential bias Ignore issues of sampling and representation Create road map for future research Ignore potential bias
