## Rationale and Objectives

Digital professionalism is increasingly being integrated into postgraduate medical education. We developed a small-group, reflective practice–based session incorporating radiology-specific cases to heighten residents' awareness about digital professionalism.

## Materials and Methods

Case-based, radiology-specific scenarios were created for a small-group, reflective practice–based session on digital professionalism. Anonymous pre- and postsession surveys evaluating residents' use of social media and their thoughts about the session were administered to the radiology residents.

## Results

Twenty-five of 38 (66%) residents responded to the presession survey with 40% (10/25) reporting daily social media use; 50% (12/24) witnessing an unprofessional posting on Facebook; and 8% (2/25) posting something unprofessional themselves. Of the 21 residents who attended the session, 13 (62%) responded to the postsession survey. Residents reported that the session added to their understanding of professionalism 3.92, 95% CI (3.57–4.27). As a result of the session, residents stated that they were more aware of protecting patient privacy and confidentiality on social media sites 3.92, 95% CI (3.47–4.37), and would take a more active role in ensuring professional use of social media as it relates to patient care 4.00, 95% CI (3.66–4.34).

## Conclusion

Residents favorably viewed the reflective case–based session on digital professionalism as a means to be more aware of ways to avoid unprofessional interactions on the internet. Our results suggest that such reflective sessions are an effective method to educate residents on key concepts regarding digital professionalism.

## Introduction

As the Internet has become fully integrated into society, the ability to access personal information through social networking and media-sharing sites has proliferated. Radiologists, like other professionals, use sites such as Facebook to communicate and share thoughts with colleagues and friends. The multiple benefits of this technology include instantaneous communication, networking, and consultation. The ease of accessibility of such sites, however, often blurs the boundary between professional and personal identities. This is especially concerning because patients, colleagues, and future employers may have access to this online information.

There is no clear definition for digital professionalism, but the American Medical Association has guidelines on the Professional Use of Social Media ( ;  Appendix 1 ) and both medical schools and residency programs must ensure professional behavior among their trainees, as the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated professionalism as one of the core competencies . The issue is pervasive in graduate medical education as well; a survey of US medical schools revealed that 60% of schools reported incidents of students posting unprofessional online content .

Digital Professionalism Presession Handout


Physician use of social media is on the rise and is evolving as a means of communication. The boundary between personal and public aspects of physicians' lives on the web can often be unclear. Even if inadvertent, breaches of patient privacy can occur via Facebook, Twitter, or other media despite using secure privacy settings. So how can physicians use social media safely? In this session, we will discuss some of the recent cases surrounding social media as well as radiology-specific case scenarios to better understand the issues surrounding patient confidentiality, what constitutes acceptable online professional conduct, and how to safely incorporate social media into both personal and professional lives.**Clinical Cases:** Employees used a camera phone to take a picture of an x-ray and text it to one another. The image also was posted to one employee's personal Facebook page, but has since been removed and no information identifying the name or other information about the patient was displayed with the image. Question:  Is this a breach of patient privacy? Should these employees be disciplined? Dr. T. communicated a few of her clinical experiences in the hospital's emergency department on her Facebook account but never specifically named the patients. However, one patient's injuries were such that an unidentified third party was able to identify the person. Question:  Should the doctor be found guilty of “unprofessional conduct” and should her clinical privileges be terminated?**Radiology department–specific scenarios:**
