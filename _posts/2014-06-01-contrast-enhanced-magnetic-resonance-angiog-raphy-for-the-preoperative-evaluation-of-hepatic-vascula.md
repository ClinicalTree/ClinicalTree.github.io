## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) when used in the preoperative evaluation of hepatic vascular anatomy in living liver donors.

## Materials and Methods

A computer-assisted literature searching of EMBASE, PubMed (MEDLINE), and the Cochrane library databases was conducted to identify potentially relevant articles which primarily examined the utility of contrast-enhanced MRA in the preoperative evaluation of hepatic vascular anatomy in living liver donors. We used the Q statistic of chi-squared value test and inconsistency index (I-squared, I  2 ) to estimate the heterogeneity of the data extracted from all selected studies. Meta-Disc software (version 1.4) (  ftp://ftp.hrc.es/pub/programas/metadisc/Metadisc\_update.htm ) was used to perform our analysis.

## Results

Eight studies were included in the present meta-analysis. A total of 289 living liver donor candidates and 198 patients who underwent liver harvesting were included in the present study. The pooled sensitivities of hepatic artery (HA), portal vein (PV), and hepatic vein (HV) in this meta-analysis were 0.84, 0.97, and 0.94, respectively. The pooled specificities of HA, PV, and HV were 1.00, 1.00, and 1.00, respectively. The pooled diagnostic odds ratios of HA, PV, and HV were 127.28, 302.80, and 256.59, respectively. The area under the summary receiver-operating characteristic curves of HA, PV, and HV were 0.9917, 0.9960, and 0.9813, respectively.

## Conclusions

The high sensitivity and specificity demonstrated in this meta-analysis suggest that contrast-enhanced MRA was a promising test for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic vascular anatomy in living liver donors.

Living donors liver transplantation (LDLT) is becoming more and more common recently because of the shortage of donor livers . One of the main clinical issues of this procedure is the risk to the donors who are healthy until the date of transplantation. To reduce the morbidity and mortality and to ensure a successful LDLT, careful preoperative evaluations of the hepatic vascular and biliary anatomy, as well as the parenchyma, are essential for us to get useful information and help us in the surgical planning for vascular and biliary anastomoses .

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is considered as the diagnostic criterion standard for the preoperative evaluation of hepatic vascular anatomy in living liver donors. However, DSA is not an ideal screening test. One of the most important reasons is because DSA is not only associated with high cost but also have an invasive nature. Because of this, DSA is associated with some potential complications . Computed tomographic (CT) angiography has also been used recently in the preoperative evaluation of the hepatic vasculature of living liver donors . In particular, multidetector CT can now provide detailed images of the arterial system in a short breath-hold. However, because CT requires using ionizing radiation and potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast material, it could also potentially lead to nephrotoxicity, thus contraindicated in those patients with decreased renal function.
