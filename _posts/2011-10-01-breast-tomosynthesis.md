Standard analog mammography is a screening success story with the proven capacity to reduce mortality from breast cancer . Conventional full-field digital mammography (FFDM) has improved the ability to detect breast cancer in select patient populations . Unfortunately, the accuracy of both analog and digital mammography remains low, with sensitivities reported at 36%–70% depending on breast tissue density and recall rates for many practitioners remaining well above the 5%–10% target range .

A fundamental reason for missed breast cancer is overlapping breast tissue, which can conceal or obscure important features of malignancy . Overlapping tissue is also a frequent cause of false-positive findings which require additional imaging, radiation exposure, expense, and anxiety for patients without added health benefit . Breast tomosynthesis is a new imaging technique designed to eliminate the issue of overlapping tissue. This new technique has the potential to reduce false positive exams while maintaining equal, or possibly improved, sensitivity for detecting breast cancer.

## Development of digital tomosynthesis

Digital tomosynthesis uses conventional x-rays and a digital detector to create tomographic cross-sectional images or “slices” of a volume of tissue. These slices are typically thin, with only a 1-mm thick plane of tissue in sharp focus; tissue above and below this plane is out of focus. These thin slices largely eliminate the issue of confusing overlapping tissue often evident on conventional projection mammography and may therefore improve the accuracy of breast imaging.

In contrast to conventional mammography, the tube head of a tomosynthesis system is engineered to move in an arc over the breast, while numerous low-dose projection images are obtained (  Fig 1 ). Data from these low-dose projection images are then manipulated using reconstruction algorithms similar to computed tomography (CT) scans to produce thin-slice cross-sectional images through the breast . Because the system is a modified digital mammography unit (  Fig 2 ), tomosynthesis images can be obtained in any orientation that can be obtained with conventional mammography including craniocaudal (CC), mediolateral oblique (MLO), and true lateral orientations.

Each of the cross-sectional slices created in digital tomosynthesis is parallel to and at different heights above the detector like conventional tomography . Conventional geometric tomography creates a single in-focus image by moving the x-ray tube and detector in synchrony about the patient, with the in-focus plane determined by the fulcrum of motion . A conventional tomography exam requires a separate acquisition—and, therefore, a separate exposure to ionizing radiation—for each in-focus plane. In contrast, digital tomosynthesis produces tomographic “slices” of an entire tissue volume using a single acquisition and single radiation exposure. The radiation dose for a tomosynthesis exam is therefore similar to that for a single conventional mammographic image .
