A little over a decade ago, three initiatives appeared that were aimed at increasing participation of radiologists in research.

- 1.
In 1998, the American Board of Radiology approved the B. Leonard Holman Pathway for training radiologists as basic and clinical research scientists.

- 2.
In 1999, the Radiological Society of North America launched a research initiative entitled Revitalizing the Radiology Research Enterprise that was intended to refocus the research mission by educating leaders on how to grow and sustain research programs in departments of radiology.

- 3.
In 2000, the Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Biomedical Engineering (NIBIB) was established at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).


In 2000, Baum, in an editorial in this journal , summarized reasons that these well-conceived entities should have a positive influence on attracting young radiologists to research. The Holman pathway with its specific intent to train radiologists as basic and clinical investigators is a well-structured, forward-thinking program. Graduating medical students can elect the 5-year Holman program that includes 27 months of clinical radiology training and 21 to 24 months of research training.
