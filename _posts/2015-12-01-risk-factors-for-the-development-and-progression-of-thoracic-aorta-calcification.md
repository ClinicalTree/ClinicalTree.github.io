## Rationale and Objectives

Vascular calcification independently predicts cardiovascular disease (CVD), and computed tomography (CT) is a useful tool to evaluate and quantify not only coronary but also thoracic aortic calcification (TAC). Previous TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident CVD at entry.

## Methods

Non–contrast-enhanced cardiac CTs were obtained in 5886 of 6814 Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants (mean age, 62 years; 48% males; 40% white, 27% black, 21% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese). Baseline and follow-up TAC scores were derived.

## Results

Overall, 4308 (73%) participants had no detectable baseline TAC. Mean follow-up duration was 2.4 ± 0.8 years, during which 12% developed TAC. The overall incidence rate was 4.8%/year and was greater with age across gender and ethnic groups; TAC incidence was significantly lower in blacks than whites. After adjustment for follow-up duration, regression analyses showed age, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensives, and smoking were associated with incident TAC. A total of 1578 (27%) participants had TAC at baseline with a positive association between average annual TAC change and baseline age. Although the overall median change was 32.9 (−1.4 to 112.2) Agatston units, 27% showed an annual score change of ≥100 and blacks showed the lowest median across ethnic groups; 22.7 (−3 to 86.8). Age, systolic blood pressure, lipid-lowering medication, diabetes, and smoking were associated with TAC progression.

## Conclusions

In MESA, traditional CV risk factors were related to both TAC incidence and progression. Blacks had the lowest incidence and median change across ethnic groups, consistent with previous findings for coronary calcification.

Vascular calcification has long been a major area of interest in cardiovascular medicine. Intimal calcification, a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, has been associated with traditional and nontraditional (uremia-related) risk factors and predictive of future cardiovascular events .

Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive method to quantify vascular calcification. Previous reports from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study have shown that traditional cardiovascular risk factors were associated with thoracic aortic calcification (TAC) with the highest prevalence in both white and Chinese populations . Moreover, TAC was shown to be a significant predictor of future coronary events in women with increased event rate in symptomatic patients with stable angina . In contrast to coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression, TAC progression reports were limited to dialysis and renal transplant patients. This is the first study to evaluate TAC progression in a large multiethnic cohort without clinically evident clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) at entry. We evaluated the risk factors associated with both TAC incidence and progression.
