## Rationale and Objectives

Patient-centered healthcare delivery has become increasingly established as a cornerstone of quality medical care, but teaching these principles in a radiology residency setting is often difficult and ineffective in a traditional lecture format. We developed a novel educational session in which actual patient letters about a healthcare provider are used to facilitate a case-based discussion of key principles of patient-centered care.

## Materials and Methods

A novel patient letter-facilitated, case-based session was conducted at two different university-based teaching institutions. Prior to the educational session, patient letters introducing the principles of patient-centered care were distributed to residents for review. During the session, radiology-specific cases were discussed in the context of the principles introduced by the letters. A post-session survey was administered to evaluate the efficacy and usefulness of the session.

## Results

Forty-six of the 61 session attendees (75%) completed the post session survey. Most respondents (93%) preferred this case-based, interactive session to a typical didactic session. A majority of the residents indicated that both the patient letters (64%) and radiology specific cases (73%) helped them think differently about how they interact with patients. They indicated that the session enhanced their understanding of professionalism (3.7 out of 5.0 \[95% CI 3.4–4.0\]) and increased their motivation to become more patient-centered (3.0 out of 4.0 \[95% CI 2.8–3.3\]).

## Conclusions

Our findings suggest that patient letter-facilitated, case-based sessions may influence resident attitudes regarding the principles of patient-centered care and may help to increase resident motivation to become more patient-centered in their own practice.

## Introduction

Patient-centered healthcare delivery has become increasingly accepted as a cornerstone of safe and high-quality medical care . The Institute of Medicine includes patient-centered care as one of its six principles of quality health care . Because of the increasing importance of patient-centered care in the practice of modern medicine, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) now includes its teaching as an essential component of resident training, under the purview of the core competency of professionalism .

The term “patient-centered care” was introduced into the medical lexicon in 1988 by the Picker/Commonwealth Program for Patient-Centered Care . A few years later, the Picker Institute elaborated on this concept, identifying several characteristics of health care that have come to be identified as core principles of patient-centered care. These core principles include (1) respect for patient values, preferences, and expressed needs; (2) coordinated and integrated care; (3) clear communication between patient and provider, including education for the patient and family; (4) physical comfort, including pain management; (5) emotional support and alleviation of fears and anxiety; (6) involvement of family members and friends, as appropriate; and (7) continuity of care, including during transitions between sites of care .
