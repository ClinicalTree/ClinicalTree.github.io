_Interventional Radiology in Women’s Health_ is a comprehensive yet concise text encompassing the gamut of interventional radiology procedures specific to women. As the emergence of subspecialization of radiology continues, there exists a need for references that are specific to these fields. This book certainly satisfies that need and belongs on the bookshelf of physicians and medical trainee at all levels. The book comprises 28 chapters arranged into seven sections. With the exception of the first, all sections begin with a clinical review chapter, each of which is excellent. These clinical review chapters provide, comprehensive information about the pathophysiology and symptomatology necessary for the implementation of accurate patient evaluation/imaging diagnoses, management, and treatment. In addition, each section contains two to six chapters that cover the subset of organ-specific disorders.

The first section, titled “Women and Interventional Radiology,” takes a significant divergence form the remainder of the book format. The author eloquently educates the reader on the practice of interventional radiology in women. The thesis of the section is “Female Physician in Interventional Radiology.” This chapter gives the perspective on the field from that of a female interventionalist. Throughout the chapter, there is a plethora of very valuable and insightful pearls likely not immediately evident to others, especially trainees.

The remaining six sections are very well organized with associated chapters encompassing pertinent patient evaluation and management, imaging, and interventional procedural information. The high-resolution illustrations reiterate and clarify the text. Additionally, given the incidence of osteoporosis in women, the author astutely includes four chapters on spinal interventions. These chapters contain well-detailed pathologic and procedural explanations with associated images referencing bone densitometry, multisequence magnetic resonance imaging, and fluoroscopic images of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.

In summary, the book is a well organized and informative resource for medical professionals of all levels. The large number of high-resolution images is very helpful to more junior radiology trainees or clinician not familiar with many interventional radiology procedures. I highly recommend this book not only for radiology, practitioners but also for others involved in women’s health care.
