## Rationale and Objectives

Aneurysm morphodynamics is potentially relevant for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. A method is proposed for automated quantification and visualization of intracranial aneurysm morphodynamics from electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) data.

## Materials and Methods

A prospective study was performed in 19 aneurysms from 14 patients with diagnostic workup for recently discovered aneurysms ( _n_ = 15) or follow-up of untreated known aneurysms ( _n_ = 4). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. An image postprocessing method was developed for quantifying aneurysm volume changes and visualizing local displacement of the aneurysmal wall over a heart cycle using multiphase ECG-gated (four-dimensional) CTA. Percentage volume changes over the heart cycle were determined for aneurysms, surrounding arteries, and the skull.

## Results

Pulsation of the aneurysm and its surrounding vasculature during the heart cycle could be assessed from ECG-gated CTA data. The percentage aneurysmal volume change ranged from 3% to 18%.

## Conclusion

ECG-gated CTA can be used to study morphodynamics of intracranial aneurysms. The proposed image analysis method is capable of quantifying the volume changes and visualizing local displacement of the vascular structures over the cardiac cycle.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) caused by rupture of an intracranial aneurysm is a devastating event associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate . Risk factors such as smoking, hypertension and alcohol consumption, and aneurysm characteristics including size, location, and shape, are known to be important indicators of aneurysm rupture risk . Associations have been found between these risk factors and the static state of the aneurysm. Aneurysmal wall motion may also be considered a risk factor and may provide additional predictive information on rupture risk because it is related to the mechanical properties of the aneurysmal wall. Several modalities have been used to study aneurysmal wall motion, such as cine phase-contrast magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) , transcranial Doppler ultrasound , time-resolved rotational angiography , and electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) . Of these, ECG-gated CTA is a suitable technique to evaluate aneurysm morphodynamics because it provides high spatial and temporal resolution within a short scanning time. In addition, CTA is used as a routine modality for diagnosis of vascular diseases . Most of these studies focused on aneurysm visualization, except from a few studies in which aneurysm morphodynamics was quantified manually . However, the small size of intracranial aneurysms, their limited volume change over the cardiac cycle, and the limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in four-dimensional (4D) CTA, make manual assessment of aneurysmal dynamic behavior a challenging task. Therefore, this study presents an automated image processing method to assess intracranial aneurysm morphodynamics from ECG-gated CTA data to facilitate visualization and quantification of aneurysmal wall motion.

## Materials and methods

## Patients

Patients aged ≥18 years were recruited via the outpatient clinic of the department of neurology. With the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), an additional ECG-gated CTA of the intracranial circulation was performed for the purpose of this study and all patients gave written informed consent. In total 14 patients (5 men and 9 women, age range 47–70 years) with 19 unruptured aneurysms were included; they were scanned as a diagnostic workup for a recently discovered unruptured aneurysm or follow-up of a known untreated aneurysm between February 2008 and November 2009.
