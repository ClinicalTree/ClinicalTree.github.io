## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the ability of normalized versus non-normalized metabolite ratios to differentiate recurrent brain tumor from radiation injury using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in previously treated patients.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five patients with previous diagnosis of primary intracranial neoplasm confirmed with biopsy/resection, previously treated with radiation therapy (range, 54–70 Gy) with or without chemotherapy and new contrast enhancing lesion on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging at the site of the primary neoplasm participated in this retrospective study. After MRS, clinical, radiological, and histopathology data were used to classify new contrast-enhancing lesions as either recurrent neoplasm or radiation injury. Volume of interest included both the lesion and normal-appearing brain on the contralateral side. Non-normalized metabolic ratios were calculated from choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) spectroscopic values obtained within the contrast-enhancing lesion: Cho/Cr, NAA/Cr, and Cho/NAA. Normalized ratios were calculated using the metabolic values from the contralateral normal side: Cho/normal creatinine (nCr), Cho/normal N-acetylaspartate (nNAA), Cho/normal choline, NAA/nNAA, NAA/nCr, and Cr/nCr. Results were correlated with the final diagnosis by Wilcoxon rank-sum analysis.

## Results

Two of three non-normalized ratios, Cho/NAA (sensitivity 86%, specificity 90%) and NAA/Cr (sensitivity 93%, specificity 70%) significantly associated with tumor recurrence even after correcting for multiple comparisons. Of the six normalized ratios, only Cho/nNAA significantly correlated with tumor recurrence (sensitivity 73%, specificity 40%), but did not remain significant after correcting for multiple comparisons.

## Conclusion

Cho/NAA and NAA/Cr were the two ratios with the best discriminating ability and both had better discriminating ability than their corresponding normalized ratios (Area under the curve = 0.92 versus 0.77, AUC= 0.85 vs. 0.66), respectively.

Differentiation between recurrent neoplasm and postradiation change in patients who were treated for primary brain tumors is often difficult, based on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features alone. Previous studies suggest that magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can discern between postradiation changes and recurrent neoplasm in patients treated for a primary brain tumor who have nonspecific contrast-enhancing lesions on follow-up imaging and have shown adequate correlation with pathologic specimens obtained at biopsy and/or resection . Prior investigators evaluating the ability of multivoxel MRS—either two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) chemical shift imaging (CSI)—to differentiate between recurrent neoplasm and postradiation change have suggested that specific standard ratios, such as the choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) or choline/N-acetylaspartate (Cho/NAA), could be used as “cutoffs” to define the different groups .

The key question is which of the different ways to measure ratios and obtaining so called cutoff values works the best?
