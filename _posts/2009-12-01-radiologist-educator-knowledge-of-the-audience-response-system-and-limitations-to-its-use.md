## Rationale and Objectives

Audience response systems (ARS) have been proven to increase residents' retention in the short and long terms. The purpose of this study was to determine what teaching faculty members know about the ARS at one institution, what the obstacles are to its use, and ways to increase its use.

## Materials and Methods

An anonymous and voluntary survey was sent to teaching faculty members. Fifty-two faculty members received the survey request and were included in the study set. The survey included questions regarding the faculty members' prior use of, understanding of, and ideas about ways to improve the ARS, as well as obstacles to its use.

## Results

Thirty of 52 faculty members (58%) responded. Eight (27%) reported prior use of the ARS. Impediments to using the system more, for infrequent users, included “no need for it again,” that it was “a bit tedious to incorporate into lectures,” and time limitations. However, most users felt that the system was overall easy to use, and they did so by incorporating it into existing lectures. Perceptions that residents learned more effectively with the ARS motivated faculty members to use it more. They noted that residents seemed to like the ARS lectures more and were more engaged than with other didactic techniques. Faculty members would increase their use of the ARS if more information technology support were available, if training sessions were held, and if they had knowledge that residents preferred this lecture format.

## Conclusions

Faculty members at the authors' academic institution used its ARS infrequently but expressed an overall desire to use it more. They suggested methods that would increase their use of the device and were particularly motivated by residents' satisfaction with their lectures. If their suggestions can be implemented, use of the ARS should increase.

Audience response systems (ARS) have been shown to result in improved learning outcomes through better short-term and long-term memory of lecture material as well as to generate excitement about teaching and learning . However, didactic lectures and hot seat–type conferences are the mainstay of postgraduate medical education in radiology residencies and unfortunately often do not include strategies for audience interaction, such as the use of ARS. The downsides of these lecture formats are that the first lacks active participation and can be boring, while the second can make trainees feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. ARS-based lectures incorporate audience participation in an anonymous fashion, which encourages active learning and removes the potential for embarrassment.

Current radiology residents are in either generation X (born 1963–1981) or the millennial generation (born 1982–2000). Generation Xers tend to be technologically savvy, to like informality, and to learn quickly . Those of the millennial generation are eager to learn and enjoy questioning things; they tend to have high self-esteem and are confident. Both generations have had high exposure to video games, computers, and cell phones. In contrast, the teachers, typically members of the baby boom generation (born 1945–1962), may not be as technologically savvy, potentially feel that trainees should “do what I did” and possibly bristle at the attitudes of trainees who are not afraid to show their independence and creativity . This generational gap can result in dissatisfaction on the parts of both the audience and the teacher, specifically in the lecture styles and in the levels of involvement and interest expressed by the attendees. Many trainees desire interactive, interesting, and unique teaching methods, whereas many faculty members often feel more comfortable continuing with the traditional didactic lecture formats when teaching.
