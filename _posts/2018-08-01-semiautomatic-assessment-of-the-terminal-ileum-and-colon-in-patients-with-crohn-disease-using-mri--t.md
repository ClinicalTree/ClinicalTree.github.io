## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to develop and validate a predictive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity score for ileocolonic Crohn disease activity based on both subjective and semiautomatic MRI features.

## Materials and Methods

An MRI activity score (the “virtual gastrointestinal tract \[VIGOR\]” score) was developed from 27 validated magnetic resonance enterography datasets, including subjective radiologist observation of mural T2 signal and semiautomatic measurements of bowel wall thickness, excess volume, and dynamic contrast enhancement (initial slope of increase). A second subjective score was developed based on only radiologist observations. For validation, two observers applied both scores and three existing scores to a prospective dataset of 106 patients (59 women, median age 33) with known Crohn disease, using the endoscopic Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) as a reference standard.

## Results

The VIGOR score (17.1 × initial slope of increase + 0.2 × excess volume + 2.3 × mural T2) and other activity scores all had comparable correlation to the CDEIS scores (observer 1: _r_ = 0.58 and 0.59, and observer 2: _r_ = 0.34–0.40 and 0.43–0.51, respectively). The VIGOR score, however, improved interobserver agreement compared to the other activity scores (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.81 vs 0.44–0.59). A diagnostic accuracy of 80%–81% was seen for the VIGOR score, similar to the other scores.

## Conclusions

The VIGOR score achieves comparable accuracy to conventional MRI activity scores, but with significantly improved reproducibility, favoring its use for disease monitoring and therapy evaluation.

## Introduction

Crohn disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease, which can present throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly affecting the small bowel and the colon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used for diagnosis and phenotyping of CD because it is safe, noninvasive, and has high accuracy for evaluating enteric disease and extramural complications . MRI features such as wall thickness and T1 and T2 bowel wall signals have been validated as biomarkers of CD activity, demonstrating good correlation with endoscopic and histopathologic grading of inflammation . Recent years have seen several MRI disease activity scores being developed and externally validated, combining multiple MRI features to predict overall disease activity . These scores are gradually disseminating into clinical practice, although at present, they are predominantly employed as research tools. The magnetic resonance index of activity (MaRIA), for example, has been developed using the Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) as a reference standard. The MaRIA is based on quantitative measurement of bowel wall relative contrast enhancement, along with subjective evaluation of mural ulceration and abnormal T2 signal . Other indices, such as the London score and the Crohn disease MRI index (CDMI), rely on qualitative grading of various features by reporting radiologists . Such activity scores can be applied to individual bowel segments, as well as to the patient as a whole, as both are important to clinical management. Before MRI scores can be widely adopted for evaluating disease activity and therapeutic monitoring, high accuracy across the spectrum of disease severity and good reproducibility among radiologists must be proven. The current literature, however, reports variable reproducibility for many features used in MRI activity scores .

One potential solution to the current limitations of MRI activity scoring is to incorporate novel software solutions, which can automatically extract relevant features from MRI data. Such software could reduce both interobserver variability and the risk of observer bias inherent to subjective evaluation . New MRI image processing methods are available, which give semiautomatic measurements of bowel wall thickness, providing superior reproducibility over manual measurement . Further techniques have been developed that automatically extract perfusion parameters from motion corrected free-breathing dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI . Although several studies have shown the potential of semiautomatic MRI assessment of CD , none of those have examined clinical practicability or validated their results using a large, independent cohort.
