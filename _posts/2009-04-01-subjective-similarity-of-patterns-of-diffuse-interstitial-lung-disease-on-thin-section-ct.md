## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the subjective similarity for pairs of images with various abnormal patterns of diffuse interstitial lung disease on thin-section computed tomography by experienced radiologists to explore a basis for selecting similar images to assist radiologists' interpretation.

## Materials and Methods

Four major patterns (ground-glass opacity, nodular opacity, reticular opacity, and honeycombing) on thin-section computed tomographic images were identified by at least two of three radiologists. One radiologist manually selected 104 image pairs, in which the images in each pair had the same pattern and were similar in appearance. An additional 208 image pairs were randomly selected and evenly divided among the four patterns. These pairs were then rated for subjective similarity (on a continuous scale ranging from 0 = not similar at all to 1.0 = almost identical) by 12 radiologists.

## Results

For radiologist-selected pairs, the mean similarity rated by the 12 radiologists was 0.72. For randomly selected pairs, the mean similarity was higher for the same pattern (0.47) than for the varying patterns (0.27) ( _P_ < .001), and among the same pattern, the mean similarity was 0.63 for ground-glass opacity, 0.58 for honeycombing, 0.45 for nodular opacity, and 0.32 for reticular opacity. The mean standard deviation for similarity ratings on all pairs given by the 12 radiologists was 0.05 (rang, 0.01–0.09).

## Conclusion

Subjective similarity ratings for pairs of abnormal images can be measured reliably and reproducibly by radiologists and will provide a basis for the selection of similar images to assist radiologists' interpretation.

Computed tomography, especially thin-section computed tomography, is a major modality that has played an important role in the diagnosis of diffuse interstitial lung disease (DILD) . DILD includes a large subgroup of lung diseases with both specific and nonspecific pathologic findings. Radiologists classify these diseases into different patterns on the basis of pathologic or radiologic features determined from thin-section computed tomographic (CT) images . The differential diagnosis of DILD is a very challenging subject, even for pathologists , but there is good agreement among thoracic radiologists for the CT diagnosis of DILD with certain abnormal patterns . A previous study reported that a method for the computer recognition of regional lung disease patterns was reproducible and performed as well as experienced human observers who had been told patients' diagnoses. However, both the observer versus the computer agreement and the interobserver agreement regarding the pattern types were not high (52% and 54%).

Subjective comparisons of two images that show similar or dissimilar categories of disease, such as comparison between two malignant lesions or between malignant and benign lesions on chest CT images or mammograms, have been investigated previously in our studies of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) . Our previous results indicated that the subjective similarity of a pair of lesions in medical images could be quantified consistently by a group of radiologists . For assisting in differential diagnosis, we believe that it will be possible to search for and retrieve images with known pathology, which are very similar to a new unknown case, from a Picture Archiving and Communication System when a reliable and useful method has been developed for quantifying the similarity of pairs of images for visual comparison by radiologists .
