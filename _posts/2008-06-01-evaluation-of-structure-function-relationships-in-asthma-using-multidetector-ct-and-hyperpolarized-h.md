## Rationale and Objectives

Although multiple detector computed tomography (MDCT) and hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging (HP MRI) have demonstrated ability to detect structural and ventilation abnormalities in asthma, few studies have sought to exploit or cross-validate the regional information provided by these techniques. The purpose of this work is to assess regional disease in asthma by evaluating the association of sites of ventilation defect on HP MRI with other regional markers of airway disease, including air trapping on MDCT and inflammatory markers on bronchoscopy.

## Materials and Methods

Both HP MRI using helium-3 and MDCT were acquired in the same patients. Supervised segmentation of the lung lobes on MRI and MDCT facilitated regional comparisons of ventilation abnormalities in the lung parenchyma. The percentage of spatial overlap was evaluated between regions of ventilation defect on HP MRI and hyperlucency on MDCT to determine associations between obstruction and likely regions of gas trapping. Similarly, lung lobes with high defect volume were compared to lobes with low defect volume for differences in inflammatory cell number and percentage using bronchoscopic assessment.

## Results

There was significant overlap between sites of ventilation defect on HP MRI and hyperlucency on MDCT suggesting that sites of airway obstruction and air trapping are associated in asthma. The percent ( _r_ = 0.68; _P_ = .0039) and absolute ( _r_ = 0.61; _P_ = .0125) number of neutrophils on bronchoalveolar lavage for the sampled lung lobe also directly correlated with increased defect volume.

## Conclusions

These results show promise for using image guidance to assess specific regions of ventilation defect or air trapping in heterogeneous obstructive lung diseases such as asthma.

Asthma affects millions of people worldwide and trends indicate increasing incidence, especially in children ( ). Subjects with asthma experience periodic wheezing and shortness of breath that manifests on pulmonary function tests as reduced forced expiratory lung volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) and increased lung residual volume normalized to the total lung capacity (RV/TLC) compared with normal subjects. Bronchodilation with beta agonists such as albuterol can partially reverse this obstructive physiology by relaxing airway smooth muscle, but evidence from airway biopsies suggests that obstruction is also accompanied by chronic inflammation and airway remodeling ( ).

Functional imaging in the lungs has great potential for mechanistic studies of lung disease, particularly for identifying regional patterns of obstruction that test physiologic hypotheses ( ). Regional mosaics of reduced parenchymal density, apparently from air trapping, are associated with asthma on computed tomography (CT) ( ). More recently, CT, and especially multidetector CT (MDCT), have been used to quantitatively measure lung parenchymal density and correlate these measures to obstructive physiology ( ).
