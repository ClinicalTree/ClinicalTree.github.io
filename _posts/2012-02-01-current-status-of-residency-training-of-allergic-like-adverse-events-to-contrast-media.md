## Rationale and Objectives

Acute allergic-like adverse reactions to contrast media are rare but life-threatening events. Residents may complete training without ever managing such an event. Surveys have shown practicing radiologists to incorrectly dose and administer medications for treatment. Thus, contrast education may be deficient or inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to assess the current status of contrast reaction education in US radiology residency programs and the methods used to test residents’ knowledge.

## Materials and Methods

A 10-question anonymous survey on residency education methods and testing pertaining to allergic-like adverse events to contrast media was distributed through the Association of Program Directors in Radiology to program directors of US diagnostic radiology residency programs. The past 4 years of the American College of Radiology in-service examination were reviewed to assess the number of contrast reaction questions.

## Results

Fifty-one programs responded to the Association of Program Directors in Radiology survey. Forty-nine percent of programs train with one lecture per year, 29.4% train with two lectures, and 16% train with three or more lectures. Only 44% include role-playing training during the lectures. Eighteen percent of programs are incorporating simulation training. Fewer than 50% of programs formally test residents’ knowledge, and there were no questions on the 2007 to 2010 American College of Radiology in-service examinations.

## Conclusions

Resident education for contrast reaction management is primarily performed with annual lectures. Only 18% of programs are using simulation training, and <50% are testing residents’ knowledge or skills. These findings suggest that education may need revision to incorporate simulation or other means of psychomotor learning.

Methods of educating radiology residents have evolved over the past decade. There has been an increase in the implementation of small-group sessions, simulation training, and Web-based models . This educational trend has occurred in part because of required compliance with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education’s six domains of clinical competence: patient care, medical knowledge, practice-based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice . The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education recommends the use of the educational method of high-fidelity simulation as one way of incorporating these domains .

Intuitively, simulation training and other types of psychomotor learning would be more applicable than lectures for learning procedural radiology skills and handling medication administration, such as when managing allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast media and gadolinium-based contrast agents. Hands-on training may be the only opportunity to apply didactic material, because of the rarity of allergic-like reactions to iodinated contrast media, estimated at a incidence of only 0.05% to 3.1% . Moderate or severe reactions are even less common, accounting for only 0.04% to 0.08% of all adverse events . Thus, a resident may complete a 4-year residency program without ever encountering an allergic-like adverse event to iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast media. This may explain the alarming results of several recent surveys.

Table 1


Survey Questions Sent Through the Association of Program Directors in Radiology


1\. Each year, how many lectures do your residents receive on contrast reactions? 2\. Do the lectures ever include practice scenarios/role playing? 3\. Do the lectures ever include hands on learning of what the different drugs look like and how to administer them? 4\. Do the residents receive special contrast reaction training during their CPR, Basic Life Support, and/or Advanced Life Support courses? 5\. Do your residents get Simulation Training (with interactive mannequins) to learn about contrast reactions? 6\. If yes, how long has your residency been using simulation? 7\. If yes, how many simulation sessions do you hold per year? 8\. How do you test residents on their knowledge of contrast reactions? Please mark all that apply. 9\. Do you use computer-based programs to teach residents about contrast reactions? 10\. If yes, how long has your residency been using computer programs?

CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
