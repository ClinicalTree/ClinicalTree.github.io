## Objectives and Rationale

Medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) in children. MB/PNET survivors are at an increased risk for developing second malignancies. Little has been reported on development of low-grade lesions of the calvarium in the radiation field in MB/PNET survivors. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of the low-grade bone lesion development in the radiotherapy field in pediatric MB/PNET survivors and describe the imaging characteristics of these lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective review which was compliant with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Forty-one MB/PNET patients (29 male) who survived for at least 2 years after initiation of radiation therapy were included. The medical records were reviewed. The most recent available brain magnetic resonance imaging studies were evaluated.

## Results

Three patients (7.3%) developed low-grade calvarial lesions and underwent resection and/or biopsy of the lesions. There were one Langerhans cell histiocytosis, one benign spindle cell lesion with myxoid change, and one fibrous dysplasia.

## Conclusion

Development of low-grade bone lesions of calvarium is not very rare in pediatric PNET/MB survivors. Bones in the radiation therapy field need to be carefully examined for assessment of secondary lesions.

Medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (MB/PNET) is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood . With contemporary therapy, including surgical debulking, radiation therapy, and multiagent chemotherapy, current progression-free survival rates are up to 81% at 5 years . However, it is known that this impressive survival outcome is accompanied by many late therapy effects, including delay in cognitive functions, hormone deficiencies, growth impairment, second neoplasms, and strokes .

In addition to the late recurrence of the original neoplasm, the common second neoplasms reported among survivors of childhood MB/PNET include secondary leukemia, high-grade gliomas, meningiomas, and basal cell skin cancer . There are few data on the development of the low-grade skull lesions in the radiation therapy fields of pediatric MB/PNET survivors . The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of low-grade skull lesions in the MB/PNET survivors at our institution and describe the imaging findings of these lesions.

![Figure 1, (a) Axial computed tomography image in bone window shows multiple well-defined, lytic lesions ( arrows ) of the calvarium. There is no bony matrix or expansile soft-tissue component. (b) The lesion is composed of sheets of histiocytes with occasional nuclear grooves and abundant cytoplasm consistent with Langerhans cells, accompanied by an infiltrate of eosinophils and neutrophils.

![Figure 2, (a) Axial T2-weighted image displays a hyperintense lesion ( arrow ) of the parietal bones at vertex. (b) Sagittal T1-weighted image demonstrates that the lesion ( arrows ) is hypointense. (c) After intravenous gadolinium administration, there is intense enhancement ( arrows ). (d) Computed tomography shows a nonspecific lytic lesion without a bony matrix or expansile soft-tissue component ( arrows ). (e) The lesion is composed of a sparsely cellular proliferation of bland, fusiform cells in a loose connective tissue matrix and labeled as “a benign spindle cell lesion with myxoid change.” (hematoxylin & eosin, original magnification 40×).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LowgradeBoneLesionsinSurvivorsofChildhoodMedulloblastomaPrimitiveNeuroectodermalTumor/1_1s20S1076633211004399.jpg)

## Case 3

![Figure 3, (a) Axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image shows a hyperintense left occipital bone lesion ( arrow ). (b,c) Sagittal precontrast and postcontrast images display that the T1-weighted hypointense lesion ( arrows ) enhances intensely with intravenous gadolinium. (d) Axial computed tomography image in bone window shows the characteristic “ground glass” appearance ( arrows ) of fibrous dysplasia. (e) The lesion exhibits biphasic histology, with irregularly shaped spicules and spherules of woven bone generally lacking a rim of osteoblasts and embedded in a stroma of bland fusiform cells without cytologic atypia or mitotic activity.
