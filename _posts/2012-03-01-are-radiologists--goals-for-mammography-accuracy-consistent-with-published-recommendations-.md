## Rationale and Objectives

Mammography quality assurance programs have been in place for more than a decade. We studied radiologists’ self-reported performance goals for accuracy in screening mammography and compared them to published recommendations.

## Materials and Methods

A mailed survey of radiologists at mammography registries in seven states within the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) assessed radiologists’ performance goals for interpreting screening mammograms. Self-reported goals were compared to published American College of Radiology (ACR) recommended desirable ranges for recall rate, false-positive rate, positive predictive value of biopsy recommendation (PPV2), and cancer detection rate. Radiologists’ goals for interpretive accuracy within desirable range were evaluated for associations with their demographic characteristics, clinical experience, and receipt of audit reports.

## Results

The survey response rate was 71% (257 of 364 radiologists). The percentage of radiologists reporting goals within desirable ranges was 79% for recall rate, 22% for false-positive rate, 39% for PPV2, and 61% for cancer detection rate. The range of reported goals was 0%–100% for false-positive rate and PPV2. Primary academic affiliation, receiving more hours of breast imaging continuing medical education, and receiving audit reports at least annually were associated with desirable PPV2 goals. Radiologists reporting desirable cancer detection rate goals were more likely to have interpreted mammograms for 10 or more years, and >1000 mammograms per year.

## Conclusion

Many radiologists report goals for their accuracy when interpreting screening mammograms that fall outside of published desirable benchmarks, particularly for false-positive rate and PPV2, indicating an opportunity for education.

Of all the specialties within radiology, breast imaging lends itself to the objective assessment of interpretive performance. As information technology infrastructure in medicine develops, more specialties may be added. Benchmarks for desirable interpretation in breast imaging have been published for the United States and Europe . Many countries now mandate that audit performance data be collected and reviewed so that administrators and radiologists know how well they are performing . It is not clear, however, what impact these efforts to collect and review audit data are having on individual radiologists or whether radiologists have goals for their own performance that align with published benchmarks.

Educational studies have shown that when clinicians understand that a gap exists between their performance and national targets, they can be predisposed to change their behavior . Interpretive accuracy in mammography could be improved if radiologists are motivated by recognizing a gap between their individual performance and desirable benchmarks. One web-based continuing medical education (CME) intervention used individual radiologist’s own recall rate data and compared it to rates of a large cohort of their peers . Radiologists with inappropriately high recall rates were able to come up with specific plans to improve their recall rates based on this recognition of a need to improve. For improvements to occur, radiologists must recognize the difference between their own performance and desired targets, which is potentially feasible given collection and review of Mammography Quality Standards Act audit data. However, it is not clear if radiologists are aware of common desirable performance goal ranges.
