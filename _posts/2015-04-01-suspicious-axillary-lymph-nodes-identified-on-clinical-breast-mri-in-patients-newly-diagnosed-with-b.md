## Rationale and Objectives

To determine whether quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features can discriminate malignant from benign axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) identified as suspicious on clinical breast MRI in patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

After approval from institutional review board, all clinical breast MR examinations performed from March 2006 through January 2010 describing at least one morphologically suspicious ipsilateral ALN in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer were identified. Each suspicious ALN underwent ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and nodes with benign results were subsequently sampled surgically. Quantitative DCE and DW MRI parameters (diameters, volume, enhancement kinetics, and apparent diffusion coefficients \[ADC\]) were measured for each suspicious ALN and a representative contralateral normal node, and each feature was compared between the ALN groups (normal, benign, and malignant).

## Results

Thirty-four suspicious ALNs (18 malignant and 16 benign) and 34 contralateral normal-appearing ALNs were included. Suspicious malignant and benign nodes exhibited larger size, greater volume, and lower ADCs than normal ALNs ( _P_ < .05). Among suspicious ALNs, the only quantitative measure that discriminated between malignant from benign outcome was percent of ALN demonstrating washout kinetics ( _P_ = .02).

## Conclusions

In ALNs deemed morphologically suspicious on breast MRI, quantitative MRI features show little value in identifying those with malignant etiology.

Axillary lymph node (ALN) status in patients newly diagnosed with invasive breast cancer provides vital prognostic information to guide therapy. In clinically node-negative women with T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer, determination of ALN status has evolved from routine surgical removal of all level I and II ALNs with complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to the modern practice of selective surgical sampling of a few (typically less than five) level I ALNs to exclude the presence of axillary nodal metastases with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This less-invasive strategy results in completion ALND in only those patients with SLNB-proven lymph node metastases, has proven to be highly accurate, and allows most patients to avoid ALND and its associated high rate of morbidity . The use of ALND is expected to decline further since recent data from the American College of Surgery Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial showed a lack of survival or locoregional recurrence benefit of completion ALND in clinically node-negative but SLNB-positive women .

Although surgical evaluation of the axilla continues to trend toward less-extensive operations, the role of imaging in axillary assessments needs to evolve with surgical technique accordingly. Several recent studies have suggested breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of ALNs , and breast primary malignancies may hold promise to confirm the presence or absence of metastatic ALNs. Because breast MRI is increasingly being used at centers for preoperative evaluation of patients newly diagnosed with breast cancer, this potential added benefit is appealing . However, given new trends in management of the axilla in the post-ACOSOG Z0011 era, determining the presence of one or more ALN metastases that are not clinically suspicious but are detected solely by imaging may provide less clinical utility than determining the number of disease-laden ALNs by SLNB. Thus, we sought to assess the ability of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI features to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical breast MRI assessments of morphologically suspicious ALNs using direct pathology-to-imaging verification.
