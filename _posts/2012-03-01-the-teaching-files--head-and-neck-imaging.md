This first edition collection of 225 head and neck cases offers a well-organized, comprehensive overview of both the common and uncommon entities most likely to be encountered in either clinical practice or board examinations. The target audience includes medical students, residents in radiology or otolaryngology, neuroradiology fellows, subspecialist neuroradiologists, and general practice radiologists who read head and neck cases.

The text is organized as a collection of cases displayed on two facing pages, with one page of text and one page containing between one and four high-quality images. A standard format is strictly adhered to for each case, beginning with a brief statement of the patient demographics and clinical history, followed by a description of the imaging findings corresponding to the figures. The imaging findings are also printed as captions for the figures on the facing page. There is no case in which the imaging findings are not clearly described. A discussion section follows, subcategorized into Definition/Background, Characteristic Clinical Features, and Characteristic Radiologic Findings. Variably included are sections for Less Common Radiologic Findings and Differential Diagnosis, as appropriate. When included, the differential diagnosis is followed by a focused discussion of the distinguishing features of each of the entities listed. The final diagnosis is then stated under its own section heading. Suggestions for further reading are listed at the end.

Although there are no chapter breaks or divisions between sections in the book, topics and related cases are grouped together; therefore, the cases are best read in the order presented rather than jumping from section to section. If, however, the reader wishes to review a specific topic, for instance, lesions of the thyroid gland, this can be easily accomplished by referencing the index of topics in the back of the book. The 14 topics covered include: orbit, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, facial fractures, temporal bone, sella, cranial vault, skull base and brain, salivary glands, oral cavity and floor of mouth, masticator space including jaws and temporomandibular joint, pharynx, larynx, parapharyngeal space, thyroid and parathyroid glands, brachial plexus, and miscellaneous neck conditions.

This concise, well-written collection of head and neck cases offers a valuable resource for practicing radiologists as well as fellows, residents, or medical students navigating the complex anatomy and pathology of the head and neck region. Head and neck imaging is widely regarded as one of the more complex areas of radiology, and this teaching file helps to demystify the subject by providing concrete examples demonstrating the spectrum of abnormalities.
