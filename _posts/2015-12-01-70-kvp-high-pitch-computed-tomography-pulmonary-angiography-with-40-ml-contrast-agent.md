## Rationale and Objectives

To assess image quality, radiation dose, and diagnostic accuracy of 70-kVp high-pitch computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) using 40 mL contrast agent and sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction (SAFIRE) compared to 100-kVp CTPA using 60 mL contrast agent and filtered back projection.

## Materials and Methods

Eighty patients underwent CTPA at either 70 kVp (group A, _n_ = 40; 3.2 pitch, 40 mL contrast medium, and SAFIRE) or 100 kVp (group B, _n_ = 40; 1.2 pitch, 60 mL contrast medium, and filtered back projection). Signal-to-noise ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio were calculated. Subjective image quality was evaluated using a five-grade scale, and diagnostic accuracy was assessed. Radiation doses were compared.

## Results

Computed tomography values, signal-to-noise ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio of pulmonary arteries were higher in group A compared to group B (all _P_ < 0.001). Subjective image quality showed no difference between the two groups ( _P_ = 0.559) with good interobserver agreement (κ = 0.647). No difference was found regarding diagnostic accuracy between the two groups ( _P_ > 0.05). The effective dose for group A was lower by 80% compared to group B ( _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusions

70-kVp high-pitch CTPA with reduced contrast media and SAFIRE provides comparable image quality and substantial radiation dose savings compared to a routine CTPA protocol.

## Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered the third most common acute cardiovascular disease after myocardial infarction and stroke . The prompt diagnosis and early initiation of appropriate medical treatment can reduce mortality of acute PE . Therefore, it is imperative to correctly diagnose PE in a timely fashion. Currently, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is established as the first-line imaging procedure to exclude PE . Wide availability and overuse of CTPA may result in substantial radiation exposure to patients, especially those requiring multiple follow-up CTPA studies for the evaluation of PE. Thus, increasing attention is now being paid to the optimization of radiation exposure from CTPA examinations . An additional concern is the contrast-induced nephropathy related to the administration of large doses of iodinated contrast media . In recent years, usage of reduced contrast agent volume has been advocated for CTPA .

Multiple strategies have been developed to reduce radiation dose and contrast volume of computed tomography angiography (CTA), including tube current modulation techniques, reduced tube voltage, automatic tube potential selection, high-pitch acquisition, iterative reconstruction algorithms, and combinations of these techniques . Among these dose-saving techniques, reduced tube voltage acquisition has been shown to be a powerful tool to lower radiation dose and contrast volume. A tube voltage of 80 kVp has been confirmed to be feasible for CTPA, with substantial reduction of radiation dose . Recently, Wichmann et al. demonstrated the feasibility of 70-kVp CTPA with 1.2 pitch and 70 mL contrast agent, and the lowest effective dose (ED) reported was 0.94 ± 0.17 mSv for single-source CTPA . By combining reduced tube voltage, high-pitch acquisition, and iterative reconstruction techniques, radiation dose and contrast agent volume can be substantially lowered. Lu et al. obtained sufficient image quality and a mean ED as low as 0.9 mSv in patients with suspected PE who underwent 80-kVp high-pitch CTPA with iterative reconstruction .
