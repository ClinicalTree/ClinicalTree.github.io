## Rationale and Objective

The computed tomography (CT) features of hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD) could play a role in its diagnosis. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis of studies examining the CT features of HVOD.

## Methods

Relevant studies published up to May 3, 2017 were searched in major electronic databases. The extracted data included the proportion of various CT features in patients with HVOD. The meta-analysis was conducted using R 3.3.3 with the “meta” package.

## Results

Eleven studies were included. The studies involved 326 patients with a mean age range of 50.2–58.9 years, and the proportion of female patients ranged from 20% to 57.5%. The meta-analysis showed the pooled proportion of CT features: hepatic parenchyma with heterogeneous hypoattenuation (81.05%, 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 56.97%–93.25%), patchy enhancement in the portal venous phase (87.09%, 95% CI: 75.15%–93.77%) with or without a narrow or invisible hepatic vein (71.02% 95% CI: 42.09%–89.20%), gallbladder wall edema (65.51%, 95% CI: 28.98%–89.84%), and patchy heterogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase (44.36%, 95% CI: 29.98%–59.76%) with or without slightly enlarged hepatic artery (56.61%, 95% CI: 40.62%–71.33%).

## Conclusion

Hepatic parenchyma with heterogeneous hypoattenuation and patchy enhancement with or without narrowing or an invisible hepatic vein in the portal venous or equilibrium phase may be the most important CT feature for diagnosing HVOD.

## Introduction

In 1954, Jelliffe reported on hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVOD), which is also known as hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) . This disease is defined as an obstruction of the sublobular veins or the central veins of hepatic lobules, which results in intrahepatic or postsinusoidal portal hypertension .

The clinical manifestation of HVOD is characterized by upper right abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, ascites, weight gain, jaundice, malaise, vomiting, and other digestive dysfunctions . The clinical manifestation of HVOD has been divided into three stages: acute, subacute, and chronic . The pathology of HVOD is centered around injury to the hepatic sinusoids or venules, with eventual infiltration by collagen and fibrous proteins leading to obliteration, and portal hypertension .
