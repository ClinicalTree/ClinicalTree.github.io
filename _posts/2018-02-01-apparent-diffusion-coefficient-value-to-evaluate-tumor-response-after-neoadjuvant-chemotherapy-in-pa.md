## Rationale and Objectives

This study explored tumor behavior in patients with breast cancer during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) by sequential measurements of tumor apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) after each chemotherapy cycle. The aim was to determine if the tumor ADC is useful to differentiate complete pathological response (cPR) from partial pathological response (pPR) during NAC.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 16 cases (in 14 patients) with diagnosis of breast cancer eligible to receive NAC were included. There were 70 magnetic resonance imaging examinations performed, 5 for each patient, during NAC cycles. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed on a 1.5T system (b values of 0 and 700s/mm  2 ). Four ADC ratios between the five MRI examinations were obtained to assess ADC changes during NAC. Absence of invasive breast cancer at surgical specimens (Miller-Payne 5) was considered as cPR and was used as reference for ADC cutoff ratios.

## Results

In this study, we were able to differentiate between cPR and pPR, after two cycles of NAC until the end of NAC before surgery (ADC ratios 2–4). The thresholds to differentiate between cPR and pPR of ADC ratios 2, 3, and 4, were 1.14 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s, 1.08 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s, and 1.25 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s, respectively, and have a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of 79.2%, 79.7% (ADC ratio 2); 100%, 66.7% (ADC ratio 3); and 100%, 83.8% (ADC ratio 4), respectively.

## Conclusions

The ADC ratios were useful to differentiate cPR from pPR in breast cancer tumors after NAC. Thus, it may be useful in tailoring treatment in these patients.

## Introduction

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), also known as primary or preoperatory chemotherapy, is used before surgical treatment. NAC is generally used as a part of conventional treatment in patients with locally advanced breast cancer with the potential to convert unresectable tumors into resectable tumors, to increase the possibility of breast conserving surgery, and also to provide an early management of micro-metastatic disease . In breast cancer, the survival benefit of patients receiving NAC is similar to that observed in patients who receive chemotherapy after surgery. Furthermore, the complete pathological response (cPR) or the absence of residual invasive disease in NAC is considered a favorable long-term predictive indicator or surrogate for survival . Even the measurement of tumor response in vivo to NAC may change the type and number of cycles of proposed chemotherapy .

The development of new anticancer therapies has prompted the search for new tools to assess the response to these therapies . The reference standard for evaluating the effects of new drugs is direct assessment of tumor tissue samples obtained through invasive techniques . In phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the evaluation of the response to treatment is mainly measured in an indirect and less invasive manner using biological markers .
