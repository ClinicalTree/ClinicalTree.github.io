## Rationale and Objectives

Diagnostic radiology resident assessment has evolved from a traditional oral examination to computerized testing. Teaching faculty struggle to reconcile the differences between traditional teaching methods and residents' new preferences for computerized testing models generated by new examination styles. We aim to summarize the collective experiences of senior residents at three different teaching hospitals who participated in case review sessions using a computer-based, interactive, anonymous teaching tool, rather than the Socratic method.

## Materials and Methods

Feedback was collected from radiology residents following participation in a senior resident case review session using Nearpod, which allows residents to anonymously respond to the teaching material.

## Results

Subjective resident feedback was uniformly enthusiastic. Ninety percent of residents favor a case-based board review incorporating multiple-choice questions, and 94% favor an anonymous response system.

## Conclusions

Nearpod allows for inclusion of multiple-choice questions while also providing direct feedback to the teaching faculty, helping to direct the instruction and clarify residents' gaps in knowledge before the Core Examination.

## Introduction

In 2013, substantive measures were implemented to change the assessment method used for board certification of diagnostic radiologists. These changes created a gap between how radiology faculty members have traditionally taught residents and how residents are now assessed for board certification. Here, we discuss how synchrony between faculty preparation of our residents for board certification testing can be achieved using audience response systems on portable computing devices, in an anonymous manner.

Diagnostic radiology candidates undergoing assessment for initial certification by the American Board of Radiology (ABR) have now transitioned from the long-standing certification process including an oral qualifying examination as the third and final step, to an assessment using two computerized examinations . First, the Core Examination is offered 36 months after commencement of their radiology residency training. This examination is administered over a 2-day period and assesses comprehension of anatomy, pathophysiology, all aspects of diagnostic radiology, and physics concepts relevant to diagnostic radiology. Categories tested include the following: breast imaging, cardiac, computed tomography, gastrointestinal, interventional radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, musculoskeletal, neuroradiology, nuclear medicine, pediatrics, physics, radiography or fluoroscopy, reproductive endocrinology, Radioisotope Safety Exam, safety, thoracic, ultrasound, and urinary. Whereas multiple-choice questions assessing the application of physics in radiology are integrated into each category, their composite score is calculated as a separate component of the examination score . If a candidate fails up to five categories, he or she must repeat testing in these categories. If a candidate fails more than five categories, the entire examination must be repeated . A candidate must pass the Core Examination before being eligible to take the Certifying Examination. The Certifying Examination can be taken 15 months after completion of diagnostic radiology residency .
