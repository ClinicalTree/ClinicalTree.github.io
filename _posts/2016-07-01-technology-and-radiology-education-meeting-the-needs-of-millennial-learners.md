Although the exact defining years vary, a millennial is generally considered someone who was born between the years 1980 and 2000. Millennials are now the largest and most diverse generational cohort in the United States and are expected to become the most educated generation in American history . By 2010, 75% of millennials had a social networking presence and 20% had posted a video of themselves online . They are more likely than the previous two generations to care about creativity in their work, and they spent more time with their parents while growing up than previous generations . Millennials view their generational identity as unique based on technology utilization and by the incorporation of technology into their social interactions . Graduate medical education is analyzing this generation of trainees' characteristics and is evolving to integrate technology to take advantage of their learning preferences.

Slanetz et al (2013) wrote about how teaching radiology in the millennial era required _facilitating_ learning and focusing on _experiences_ given these demographic features . In the 2014 educational issue of _Academic Radiology_ , with the support of the Alliance for Medical Student Educators in Radiology and the Alliance for Clinician Educators in Radiology, Kelly summarized the current themes of change and technology in radiology education . There has been an emergence of fused clinical content with social media, an effort to make education more experiential and interactive, and a migration of simulations into the virtual environment. Emphasis has been placed on merging technology into the teaching of the classic topics of anatomy, differential diagnoses, and pathognomonic findings. However, technology may also allow educators to quantify a shift from volume to value for trainees. With the dawn of decision support utilization, and radiology's evolution from a fee-for-service to a risk-based accountable care healthcare model, it will be important for our trainees to have the ability to demonstrate efficiency, safety, and quality . In short, technology may be used to teach our millennial trainees to be better diagnosticians _and_ better stewards of imaging, bringing increased value to stakeholders.

One of the first iterations of using online capability in radiology education was shifting clinical content to digital modules and e-books. Quite simply, there has been a migration of traditional book subject matter to web-based sources. Early adopters of web-based learning modules found favorable responses from millennial trainees . Paid subscriptions to online versions of classic radiology texts and unrestricted quick references are available. Digital content is rapidly supplanting hard copy texts as a preferred reference source . The ability for academic radiologists to quickly disseminate information to their trainees in the form of an e-book, using one of multiple free programs, gives increased flexibility to both the author and the end user .

Radiology applications take advantage of widespread utilization of smartphones by millennials . Many radiology resources now have downloadable applications, making access to content one touch and portable . A radiology organizational and meeting application, like Radiological Society of North America (RSNA)'s 2015 application, offered a list of technical exhibits, a site map, and the ability to personalize a daily agenda . Content applications range from radiology anatomy, such as the Brain MRI Atlas , to case-based questions, as offered by CTisus iQuiz . There are also applications that enable viewing of images, like the OsiriX HD for Mac users , and applications that allow medical image sharing and collaboration, as provided by the Nuance PowerShare application .
