## Rationale and Objectives

Abnormalities in brain structure have been implicated in psychosis. Herein, we investigated the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and average diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the bilateral anterior limb of internal capsules between neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients and appropriately matched healthy controls.

## Materials and Methods

Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with a 1.5 T superconductive MR scanner, and diffusion tensor imaging was carried out in 21 neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients and 18 matched healthy controls. FA and ADC were measured by region of interest analysis.

## Results

Compared with healthy controls, the neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients showed significantly reduced FA in the bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule. However, the difference in the ADC values between the patients and the controls was not significant.

## Conclusions

FA of the bilateral anterior limb of the internal capsule was reduced in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients, indicating that the integrity of the white matter of the bilateral thalamus-frontal connection or the bilateral thalamus-anterior cingulate gyrus connection was destroyed.

Schizophrenia is a common severe mental disorder mainly characterized by disordered thought, emotion, behavior, and will, and a disharmony between the self and environment. It has an estimated annual incidence of 0.11 in China ( ). Schizophrenia is accompanied by a very high disability rate, and most patients are unable to engage in employment or educational pursuits, and are thus a burden to both the society and their families. Thus far, the etiologic factors in schizophrenia have not been completely delineated. Thus exploring the etiologic factors and understanding the exact pathomechanism of schizophrenia are challenges for the clinicians and researchers of mental health departments.

An increasing number of studies have suggested that the clinical symptoms of schizophrenia may not result from the impaired function of some part of the brain, but an abnormal connection between cerebral neurons. The presence of cerebral structural abnormalities in schizophrenia has been confirmed, and a large number of encephalic regions are affected, many of which are closely associated with cognitive function. Microstructural abnormalities in the white matter fiber bundle interconnecting these encephalic regions could also cause schizophrenia that is characterized by a widely distributed disconnection of cerebral circuits ( ). Today, with the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become the primary method for studying the microstructure of the white matter in schizophrenia. By using DTI, this study aims to quantitatively explore the difference between the fractional anisotropy (FA) value and the average diffusion coefficient (ADC) value of the microstructure of the anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) interconnecting the frontal lobes and the anterior cingulate gyrus with the thalamus and to further investigate the pathomechanism of schizophrenia.
