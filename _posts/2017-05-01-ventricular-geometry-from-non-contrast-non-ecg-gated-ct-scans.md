## Rationale and Objectives

Imaging-based assessment of cardiovascular structure and function provides clinically relevant information in smokers. Non-cardiac-gated thoracic computed tomographic (CT) scanning is increasingly leveraged for clinical care and lung cancer screening. We sought to determine if more comprehensive measures of ventricular geometry could be obtained from CT using an atlas-based surface model of the heart.

## Materials and Methods

Subcohorts of 24 subjects with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 262 subjects with echocardiography were identified from COPDGene, a longitudinal observational study of smokers. A surface model of the heart was manually initialized, and then automatically optimized to fit the epicardium for each CT. Estimates of right and left ventricular (RV and LV) volume and free-wall curvature were then calculated and compared to structural and functional metrics obtained from MRI and echocardiograms.

## Results

CT measures of RV dimension and curvature correlated with similar measures obtained using MRI. RV and LV volume obtained from CT inversely correlated with echocardiogram-based estimates of RV systolic pressure using tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity and LV ejection fraction respectively. Patients with evidence of RV or LV dysfunction on echocardiogram had larger RV and LV dimensions on CT. Logistic regression models based on demographics and ventricular measures from CT had an area under the curve of >0.7 for the prediction of elevated right ventricular systolic pressure and ventricular failure.

## Conclusions

These data suggest that non-cardiac-gated, non-contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scanning may provide insight into cardiac structure and function in smokers.

## Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity in smokers, and as much as 50% of the estimated 24 million patients in the United States with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) die of cardiovascular causes . Although echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are often used to study cardiac structure and function in COPD , these are not routinely deployed in all smokers. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is broadly used in clinical care and is increasingly used for lung cancer screening in high-risk smokers . Assessment of cardiac structure on those CT scans may help identify patients with COPD at greater risk of developing cardiac dysfunction. Rapid, noninvasive assessments of cardiac morphology and a better understanding of the functional interdependence of heart and lung may improve healthcare outcomes through early detection and initiation of treatment.

CT has been used to quantify coronary and thoracic aortic calcification , study the size of the pulmonary artery and aorta , and describe the relationship between pulmonary vascular and parenchymal disease progression . The caliber of other vessels such as the pulmonary veins has been explored as an image-based metric of volume status .
