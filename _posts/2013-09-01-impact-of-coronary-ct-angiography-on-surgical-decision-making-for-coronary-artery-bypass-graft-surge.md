## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the impact of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) on treatment decisions made by cardiac surgeons and to explore barriers to implementation of CCTA as first-line imaging workup before coronary artery bypass.

## Materials and Methods

Tertiary academic medical center retrospective cohort study. Questionnaires administered to three cardiac surgeons regarding diagnosis and treatment decisions with level of confidence in decision making for 30 chest pain patients, after reviewing deidentified catheter coronary angiogram (CCA) and CCTA images on the same patients, several weeks apart.

## Results

All surgeons tended to report more severe disease with CCTA than CCA ( _P_ < .05). Treatment decisions differed in 12 (40%), 14 (47%), and 18 (60%) patients within each individual surgeon based on CCTA images compared to CCA images ( _P_ = .11, .01, and .02, respectively). Confidence levels were significantly higher with CCA for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease for all three surgeons ( _P_ < .05). There was a tendency toward more invasive treatment choices (angioplasty, stent insertion, or coronary artery bypass graft) when making treatment decisions based upon CCTA images.

## Conclusions

Severity of disease may be overestimated by cardiac surgeons when using CCTA as a decision-making test, tending toward more invasive treatment choices compared to CCA. Additionally, cardiac surgeons may be more confident with their diagnosis and treatment based on CCA. These may be important limitations in the application of CCTA in clinical practice and may reflect the maturation of CCTA use in practice, diffusion of the technology and/or a reflection of the technology itself.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality in the United States, responsible for approximately 1 in 6 deaths . In 2009, there were 1,476,000 inpatient diagnostic cardiac catheterizations performed, and less than half of these (693,000) were associated with a percutaneous coronary intervention . In 2008, there were almost a quarter of a million coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) performed (1081 per million adults) in the United States with the annual numbers decreasing, estimated at about 150,000 CABG performed in 2012 . Patients being evaluated for CABG require imaging of the coronary arteries to evaluate the vessels that require bypass and potential targets for distal anastomosis.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a relatively new noninvasive diagnostic test for CAD, which requires peripheral intravenous iodinated contrast injection and permits omniplanar imaging best suited to the position and angulation of each individual coronary artery segment. CCTA is a highly sensitive test with good specificity and a very high negative predictive value, most useful for patients at low or intermediate risk for CAD . Recent technological advancements allow faster imaging at higher heart rates with less radiation exposure . Catheter coronary angiography (CCA) is the reference standard for diagnosing CAD. It is invasive, requiring direct injection of contrast material into the coronary arteries, has a higher complication rate than CCTA, and is significantly more expensive, but permits concomitant intervention for coronary artery stenosis if appropriate . The costs billed for and payments received by the hospital for a CCA are about two to three times greater than for CCTA . CCTA could potentially replace CCA in patients who are at lower risk for CAD and have a lower probability of requiring subsequent intervention.
