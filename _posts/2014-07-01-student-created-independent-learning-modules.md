## Rationale and Objectives

Modern radiology clerkships require a rigorous, in-depth curriculum usually involving a variety of educational activities. With increasingly constrained faculty time and departmental resources, finding activities that are easy to implement and of high educational value can be a challenge.

## Materials and Methods

We introduced a novel educational activity to our radiology clerkship in which students created independent learning modules (ILMs) that were reviewed by their classmates. Feedback surveys were used to assess the activity and guide a revision to the program. Feedback surveys after the revision were used to assess the overall perceived value of the program.

## Results

Twenty-seven students in two successive sessions of our elective radiology clerkship completed the ILM activity and provided feedback. Sixty-four students in five subsequent sessions completed a modified version of the activity and provided feedback. Students in this final group rated the activity's educational value at 8.3/10, with most describing both the creation and reviewing of the ILMs as similarly or more educationally valuable than lectures (41 of 64 \[64%\], 48 of 64 \[75%\], respectively). Students indicated the target ILM length of 15 minutes was “about right” (61 of 64 \[95%\]), and that the overall proportion of the course dedicated to the ILM activity was appropriate (49 of 64 \[77%\]).

## Conclusions

A novel student-created ILM activity was highly reviewed by radiology elective students, both with regard to the educational value of creating and taking the ILMs. Clerkship directors wishing to supplement their curricula with an easy-to-implement high-value activity may consider adding a student-created ILM assignment.

The need for high-quality, engaging, and rigorous radiology clerkships has never been greater.

First, students demand it. Modern medical students come to medical school with extensive experience with digital resources . While in the preclinical years of medical school, students are increasingly exposed to nonlecture learning formats, including e-learning, problem-based learning sessions, small-group sessions, and workshop style formats .
