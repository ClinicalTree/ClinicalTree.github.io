## Rationale and Objectives

Our objective is to determine whether expected utility (EU) and the area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC) are consistent with one another as endpoints of observer performance studies in mammography. These two measures characterize receiver operator characteristic performance somewhat differently. We compare these two study endpoints at the level of individual reader effects, statistical inference, and components of variance across readers and cases.

## Materials and Methods

We reanalyze three previously published laboratory observer performance studies that investigate various x-ray breast imaging modalities using EU and AUC. The EU measure is based on recent estimates of relative utility for screening mammography.

## Results

The AUC and EU measures are correlated across readers for individual modalities ( _r_ = 0.93) and differences in modalities ( _r_ = 0.94 to 0.98). Statistical inference for modality effects based on multi-reader multi-case analysis is very similar, with significant results ( _P_ < .05) in exactly the same conditions. Power analyses show mixed results across studies, with a small increase in power on average for EU that corresponds to approximately a 7% reduction in the number of readers. Despite a large number of crossing receiver operator characteristic curves (59% of readers), modality effects only rarely have opposite signs for EU and AUC (6%).

## Conclusions

We do not find any evidence of systematic differences between EU and AUC in screening mammography observer studies. Thus, when utility approaches are viable (i.e., an appropriate value of relative utility exists), practical effects such as statistical efficiency may be used to choose study endpoints.

Laboratory observer performance studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology have become a mainstay for demonstrating improvements in technology or methodology for radiological imaging . These studies are now found widely in the radiological literature and are often used as evidence in submissions to regulatory agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration . Most commonly, ROC studies use a rating of suspicion (e.g., probability of malignancy) to determine the tradeoff between sensitivity and false-positive fraction in a diagnostic task. To generalize results to the population of patients and readers, a substantial effort is required to collect a sample of relevant cases and to evaluate a sample of readers from which inferences regarding the imaging modality are obtained .

These inferences are based on an index, or figure of merit, extracted from the ROC curve. The figure of merit summarizes a ROC curve with a single number representing overall performance that can be compared across readers, cases, and modalities. The predominant figure of merit for ROC studies of observer performance has been the area under the ROC curve (AUC), which is the diagnostic sensitivity averaged over all possible false-positive fractions . The AUC is independent of disease prevalence and can also be interpreted as a measure of class separability because it represents the probability that a case from the abnormal population will considered more suspicious than a case from the normal population.

![Figure 1, This diagram shows how area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and expected utility (EU) are determined for a given ROC curve. A smooth ROC curve is fitted to observed (hypothetical) data using the contaminated binormal model and maximum likelihood fitting. The AUC is depicted in gray. Under the assumption that task utilities result in iso-utility lines with a given slope, the y -intercept of the highest iso-utility line that intersects the ROC curve defines the EU measure. Note that the iso-utility line is tangent to the ROC curve at the optimal operating point.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ComparativeStatisticalPropertiesofExpectedUtilityandAreaUndertheROCCurveforLaboratoryStudiesofObserverPerformanceinScreeningMammography/0_1s20S1076633213005849.jpg)

![Figure 5, Power analysis. Plots of statistical power based on the Hillis and Berbaum method (35) are plotted as a function of the number of readers for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) (a) and expected utility (EU) (b) figures of merit in each study; legend in (a) applies to both plots. The number of cases used in the power calculation is the same as the number in the actual study. The effect size was set to the largest difference in reader averaged performance across modalities, except in the Digital Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial studies, in which a default of 0.1 was used for AUC and 0.136 was used for EU based on the regression line in Figure 2 b. The number of readers needed to get 80% power (c) varies considerably from study to study. On average, EU results in a 7% reduction in the number of readers needed to achieve 80% power.
