## Rationale and Objectives

Health agencies making regulatory marketing-authorization decisions use qualitative and quantitative approaches to assess expected benefits and expected risks associated with medical interventions. There is, however, no universal standard approach that regulatory agencies consistently use to conduct benefit-risk assessment (BRA) for pharmaceuticals or medical devices, including for imaging technologies. Economics, health services research, and health outcomes research use quantitative approaches to elicit preferences of stakeholders, identify priorities, and model health conditions and health intervention effects.

## Materials and Methods

Challenges to BRA in medical devices are outlined, highlighting additional barriers in radiology. Three quantitative methods—multi-criteria decision analysis, health outcomes modeling and stated-choice survey—are assessed using criteria that are important in balancing benefits and risks of medical devices and imaging technologies.

## Results

To be useful in regulatory BRA, quantitative methods need to: aggregate multiple benefits and risks, incorporate qualitative considerations, account for uncertainty, and make clear whose preferences/priorities are being used. Each quantitative method performs differently across these criteria and little is known about how BRA estimates and conclusions vary by approach. While no specific quantitative method is likely to be the strongest in all of the important areas, quantitative methods may have a place in BRA of medical devices and radiology.

## Discussion

Quantitative BRA approaches have been more widely applied in medicines, with fewer BRAs in devices. Despite substantial differences in characteristics of pharmaceuticals and devices, BRA methods may be as applicable to medical devices and imaging technologies as they are to pharmaceuticals. Further research to guide the development and selection of quantitative BRA methods for medical devices and imaging technologies is needed.

Weighing expected benefits against expected risks is essential for health agencies making regulatory marketing-authorization decisions. Benefit–risk balance of medical interventions also influences adoption and use after approval, although costs become a major factor as well. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) explicitly and implicitly weigh these tradeoffs in determining whether new pharmaceutical products and medical devices, such as diagnostic imaging tests, have met minimum standards for overall quality, that is, safety- (risk) and benefit-related effects. In 1998, a World Health Organization–United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization encouraged formalizing frameworks and methods for benefit–risk assessment (BRA) in a report calling for improvements in existing approaches to assessing pharmaceutical products . Greater attention has been applied to pharmaceutical products in the implementation of quantitative BRA methods, although initiatives have also focused on processes for medical devices . In 2012 alone, three publications from the FDA, EMA, and the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) have addressed BRA methods for pharmaceutical products or devices . Although there are distinct qualities or characteristics associated with diagnostic tests compared to medicines as “economic goods,” quantitative BRA methods may be useful—in terms of improving consistency, reliability, and transparency—via their application to device-related premarket decision-making processes.

The aim of this article is to identify and discuss opportunities and challenges associated with approaches to quantitative BRA applied to medical devices. First, we describe ways in which the environment for BRA assessment for devices differ from that of pharmaceutical products, and we focus on key issues of the device regulatory environment—predicate creep, multiple applications, and behavioral factors. As an important subcategory within medical devices, relevant applications to diagnostic imaging receive special attention. Second, we describe three promising methods by which quantitative BRA assessment may be conducted in the area of diagnostic imaging, pointing out positive features and limitations of each. Researchers and regulators may wish to formalize approaches to this evolving field. We suggest that policy changes and additional research are needed to better assess the expected benefits and expected risks of devices in specific applications, such as diagnostic imaging tests.

Potential Advantages and Disadvantage of Three Quantitative Methods: Relative Performance by Four Criteria


Criteria Multicriteria Decision Analysis Health Outcomes Modeling Stated-Choice Surveys Assessing multiple risks and benefits The Simplest and most direct method for weighing multiple criteria or attributes. Easily performed with ranking or rating methods. Multiple benefits and risks are combined into a single metric—net health benefit; results may not be transparent. Sample size requirements increase dramatically as risk and benefit criteria increase; cognitive burden of multiplicity may become problematic. Scoring or prioritizing qualitative criteria (eg, risk tolerance, severity of disease, and so forth) Qualitative criteria can be given weights and then combined with quantitative criteria into a single metric. May require the use of other methods to convert qualitative criteria into quantitative values although, in principle, the framework can be extended. Preference elicitation techniques may be used to quantify preferences for qualitative criteria. Accounting for uncertainty Uncertainty with regard to performance or preference weights of attributes may be explored with sensitivity analyses. Typically, no account is made for quality of information by way of confidence or credible intervals. One-way sensitivity analysis testing the impact of modifying individual parameters is generally a minimum standard. More advanced probabilistic sensitivity analyses incorporate distributions of inputs rather than fixed estimates. Excellent method for estimating tolerance for uncertainty. Respondents may struggle with assigning preferences to low probability events. Accounting for stakeholder preferences Makes explicit the decision makers' criteria weights of the decision makers. May have poor generalizability because of small sample sizes. Regulatory decision makers have not been receptive to the use of patient health state utilities combined with epidemiological models to project QALYs. A more formal method for eliciting stakeholder preferences via respondents choosing among specific discrete sets of attributes and levels of attributes. Best Applications When time and resources are very constrained and patient preferences and health outcomes are not known and cannot be collected in the time for decision making. When longer term outcomes influence the benefit–harm balance and/or there is substantial uncertainty around point estimates for quantifying benefits and/or harms. When patients' tolerance for uncertainty strongly influences the benefit–harm balance or when identifying preferences for specific attributes is highly relevant or useful.

Advantages and disadvantages of the methods are subjectively appraised by the authors.
