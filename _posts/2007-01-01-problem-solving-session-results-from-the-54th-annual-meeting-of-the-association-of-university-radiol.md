The problem-solving session at the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) was formulated by the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology (A  3 CR  2 ) steering committee at the 2005 RSNA meeting in Chicago. Two issues were discussed: 1) the impact on vascular interventional radiology training by nonradiology specialties and how radiology training programs must adapt to maintain and expand the specialty and 2) how can radiology programs meet the needs of residents who have differing professional expectations and goals, specifically the diversity of resident interest in private practice versus academic careers?

The topics were discussed in two sessions composed of A  3 CR  2 members as well as radiology residents from across the country. Solutions were then discussed in a joint session with the Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) and Association of Program Coordinators in Radiology (APCR) and final conclusions were formulated. Participants included several interventional radiologists.

## Issue 1: The impact on vascular interventional radiology training by nonradiology specialties and how radiology training programs must adapt to maintain and expand the specialty

This topic was introduced with an informal poll of the approximately 60 residents in attendance. The question posed was how many residents were interested in pursuing a career in interventional radiology as a medical student or junior resident? Approximately one-third of the residents responded affirmatively. The next question posed was how many residents are currently pursuing or have pursued a fellowship in interventional radiology. Exactly five hands remained up.

## Rekindle Resident Interest in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (VIR)

The informal poll emphasized that there is a problem. Groups then focused on what factors caused their diminished career interest in VIR.

A participant in one of the groups made an analogy that to successfully sell a product, you must market it. Many medical students are unaware of role the interventional radiologists take in patient care and what procedures and treatments they can offer. One method in increasing this awareness was to increase exposure to VIR and to establish a mentorship program for medical students. This could be done within radiology rotations or even completely separately. The mentorship program could also be implemented within radiology residencies especially for residents that have initial interest in VIR.

Another solution is to allow for a VIR rotation within the internship before radiology residency and to emphasize more of the preprocedural and postprocedural aspects rather than the procedure itself. Groups also discussed the dedicated VIR tract, which some programs have already implemented. Increased VIR research, especially by residents and medical students, should be encouraged.
