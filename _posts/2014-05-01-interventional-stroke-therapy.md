_Interventional stroke therapy_ is an overview of the field of stroke intervention and imaging with many short summaries and illustrations helpful for the novice and the advanced learner alike. Although not a comprehensive resource, it is useful for understanding the basic imaging techniques, scientific underpinnings, and current controversies in the field. This concise first edition publication is a collaboration of German authors, edited by Drs. Jansen and Brueckmann, who do a nice job in briefly summarizing developments in the field for easy understanding.

The book is divided into three sections: Neuroimaging of stroke; treatment of acute ischemic stroke; and treatment of supraaortic, extracranial, and intracranial stenosis.

The three sections are separated into chapters dedicated to specific areas, such as imaging of vertebrobasilar occlusion, intravenous thrombolysis, or treatment of intracranial stenosis. Overall, the chapters are concise and well constructed. They are easy to navigate with frequent summaries and occasional tables for quick reference. Treatment options and studies appear up to date, and the editors have made an effort to direct the text to a US audience. Each of the three sections includes a final summary that is also brief and helpful.

The first section covers stroke imaging, which is divided into chapters according to stroke etiology. Here, they describe the clinical presentation, standard imaging techniques, and some newer techniques such as computed tomographic perfusion. Magnetic resonance perfusion in the setting of acute ischemic stroke is not included, however. The images in the neuroimaging section are helpful, but limited because of the brevity of the discussion and constitute a succinct overview rather than a comprehensive text.

The second section discusses the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, including intravenous thrombolysis and intraarterial thrombolysis. There is a summary of the major clinical trials of thrombolysis in acute stroke that is condensed and valuable as an excellent overview of a confusing topic, one of the highlights of the book. Also included are discussions and illustrations of available mechanical devices with discussion of their treatment efficacy for various types of cerebrovascular occlusions.

The final section discusses treatment of stenosis, including extracranial stenosis, with brief overviews of clinical diagnosis, imaging diagnosis, indication, and treatment options.
