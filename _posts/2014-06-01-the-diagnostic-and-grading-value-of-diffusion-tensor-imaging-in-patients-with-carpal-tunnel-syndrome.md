## Rationale and Objectives

In this study, we investigated the diagnostic and grading value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

## Materials and Methods

Of the 120 subjects included in the present study, 72 were in the CTS group and 48 were in the healthy control group. In addition, the patients with CTS were further divided into three subgroups based on severity (mild, moderate, and severe) according to electrophysiological studies (EPS). DTI-derived parameters (fractional anisotropy \[FA\] and apparent diffusion coefficient \[ADC\]) were evaluated at four median nerve levels. The mean FA and ADC values of the CTS groups and healthy controls were compared separately. Correlations and possible relationships between DTI parameters and EPS results were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was used to calculate the FA and ADC cutoff values for CTS diagnosis and grading.

## Results

Statistically significant differences were observed in mean FA and ADC between the normal and mild, mild and moderate, and moderate and severe subgroups. Significant correlations were found between DTI parameters and EPS measurements based on severity. FA and ADC threshold values, as well as the sensitivity and specificity levels, for diagnosing and grading CTS were determined.

## Conclusions

DTI parameters can provide helpful information for CTS. The correlations of FA and ADC measurements versus EPS measurements based on severity were significant. Moreover, FA and ADC threshold values were sufficient for the diagnosis and grading of CTS.

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral neuropathy, caused by entrapment of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel level . Reportedly, the prevalence of CTS is 3.8% in the general population and is more common in women than in men, occurring predominantly in subjects aged between 40 and 60 years . Combined use of clinical symptoms, physical examinations, and electrophysiological studies (EPS) are considered as the reference standard for diagnosis of CTS. However, in some cases discrepancies in the diagnosis and severity of CTS may be because of the different measured clinical and EPS parameters . Imaging methods such as ultrasound (US) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may resolve these discrepancies . In particular, conventional MRI may show enlargement of the median nerve, nerve flattening, increased nerve signal intensity, and bowing of the transverse carpal ligament in patients with CTS . However, the sensitivity and specificity of conventional MRI findings are inadequate for diagnosis of CTS and provide insufficient diagnostic data .

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced MRI method used to measure the diffusion of water in tissue. The water diffusion anisotropy can be measured with DTI. Directional anisotropy of water diffusibility can be measured by microstructural parameters such as fractional anisotropy (FA; quantitative index used to characterize the degree of diffusion anisotropy) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC; one-third of the trace of the diffusion tensor) . The main clinical application of DTI is white matter tract visualization , which can be useful for imaging the median nerve . Studies showing that DTI is a feasible diagnostic method for CTS diagnosis are limited .
