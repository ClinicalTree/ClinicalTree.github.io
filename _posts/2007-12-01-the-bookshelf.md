_Casting Type Calcifications: Sign of a Subtype with Deceptive Features_ represents the second volume offered by Tabar, Tot, and Dean in their _Breast Cancer-Early Detection with Mammography_ series. I will admit that the prospect of digesting an entire 300-page book dedicated to one single subtype of mammographically detected calcifications sounded a trifle dreary, but, in the end, I felt rewarded on several fronts.

This book is less a textbook than a graphically presented argument for the authors’ theory that casting type calcifications (more familiarly known to American readers as fine linear/branching calcifications) represent an independent unfavorable prognostic factor when presenting as a component of small invasive breast cancers. Their case is laid out in a logical manner. The first chapter exhaustively reviews the variety of calcifications that can “live” within the ductal system of the breast via numerous gorgeous mammographic examples with correlative pathologic color templates. The second chapter outlines different ways that malignant calcifications can appear/morph over time, using several cases with consecutive mammographic studies spanning years. Chapter 3 presents the authors’ theory that cancers which contain casting calcifications represent a special subtype of breast cancer with a “divergent nature,” proposing that this subtype actually elicits new ducts to form (“neoductgenesis”) rather than simply colonizing existing ducts. Chapter 4 imparts supporting evidence for their theory in the form of comparative survival statistics, with “demonstration” cases interspersed. The last two chapters offer multiple additional sample cases, the last with stereoscopic pathologic images (three-dimensional viewer included with book).

The authors’ theories are intriguing, but are not uncontested in the literature. Still, even if one doesn’t swallow them whole, they serve as an important reminder that breast cancer is, almost certainly, a heterogeneous rather than single disease, and how much more research is needed, using a multispecialty approach, to address underdiagnosis or overdiagnosis and treatment. This book engenders much food for thought.

Additionally, the surfeit of high quality images with correlative histology makes this book a gold mine for mammographers-in-training who require volume and repetition before a “feel” for breast calcifications begins to take hold.

One mild limitation is the non–BI-RADS terminology used throughout the volume. In addition, some chapters are leanly referenced, with about half of the citations representing the authors’ own works.
