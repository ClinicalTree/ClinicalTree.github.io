We present an overview of the Centers for Quantitative Imaging Excellence (CQIE) program, which was initiated in 2010 to establish a resource of clinical trial-ready sites within the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Centers (NCI-CCs) network. The intent was to enable imaging centers in the NCI-CCs network capable of conducting treatment trials with advanced quantitative imaging end points. We describe the motivations for establishing the CQIE, the process used to initiate the network, the methods of site qualification for positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, and the results of the evaluations over the subsequent 3 years.

## Introduction

## Background and Objectives

Advanced imaging methodologies play a pivotal role in cancer care, providing early detection of tumors and guidance of therapy as well as subsequent disease monitoring and surveillance. Advantages inherent in imaging assays include the ability to obtain spatially localized information over large volumes of tissue or the entire body compared to the limited sampling available for biopsy-driven histopathology or in vitro blood- or serum-based assays and their inherent drawbacks. In addition, in vivo imaging assays have the ability to provide multiple evaluations of a molecular target or tumor metabolism over time, allowing for adaptive therapy without invasive procedures.

Continued progress in research and development of imaging agents, methodologies, and technologies holds promise for better cancer care—for example, with improved tumor detection and biological characterization. New imaging agents and approaches exploit various pathophysiologic characteristics of tumors with evaluations of phenomena such as metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia, angiogenesis, essential signal pathway blockage(s), and other tumor microenvironment modifications. These refined imaging procedures have the potential to be surrogate or primary biomarkers in oncologic patient evaluation. In addition, the use of validated molecular imaging probes is critical both to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) drug discovery and development process and the ongoing NCI commitment to further our understanding of cancer biology.

While imaging for patient care in clinical oncology practice is predominately focused on tumor diagnostics, imaging within oncology clinical trials has expanded to assess tumor biologic characteristics, including pretreatment patient stratification and functional changes during and after therapeutic interventions. This expanded focus on oncologic imaging necessitates a more stringent quality management program to ensure that imaging devices are functioning appropriately and that properly controlled imaging acquisition protocols are being used at radiology sites performing imaging on patients in clinical trials. It is essential that the resulting imaging examinations are of sufficient quality to assess the desired end points, and that the imaging assessment is performed in a consistent manner across sites. Finally, imaging data in clinical trials should be appropriately preserved for central analysis, regulatory documentation, and potential downstream secondary studies. As such, there has been increased recognition of the need to standardize imaging protocols in clinical trials .

With these objectives in mind, the NCI Cancer Imaging Program (CIP) initiated the Centers for Quantitative Imaging Excellence (CQIE) program in 2010 to establish a resource of clinical trial-ready sites within the NCI-designated Cancer Centers (NCI-CCs) network, capable of conducting treatment trials that contain integral molecular and functional advanced quantitative imaging end points. The NCI-CC sites serve as centers for transdisciplinary, translational, and clinical research, and link cancer research to health service delivery systems outside the center via proactive dissemination programs. Such centers were optimal sites in which to support and promote advanced quantitative imaging for measurement of response.

Delays can often occur in opening treatment trials with advanced imaging aims within a multicenter setting. Areas of delay may include site selection based on qualification of advanced imaging capabilities, dissemination of relevant qualification standards for molecular and/or functional imaging modalities, and lack of coordinated collaboration among imaging and treatment/research teams at a site. These areas of concern were addressed by organizing and implementing the CQIE program under the auspices of NCI CIP, with administrative coordination and oversight from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), NCI's cooperative group with an exemplary history of performing large phase II and III studies to evaluate imaging methods and agents for enhanced cancer management. This report on CQIE progress details the experience and lessons learned in the course of qualifying approximately 60 NCI-CC sites across the nation; these centers have now demonstrated competence in key areas of advanced imaging within the modalities of static and dynamic positron emission tomography (PET), volumetric computed tomography (vCT) or magnetic resonance (vMR), and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging (DCE-MRI) in body and/or brain. This CQIE network is now a proven resource supporting development and clinical implementation of quantitative imaging for measurement of response to therapy, with the potential to be extended to other NCI and National Institutes of Health programs that support advanced imaging within clinical trials under the NCI Divisions of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis as well as the Division of Cancer Prevention.
