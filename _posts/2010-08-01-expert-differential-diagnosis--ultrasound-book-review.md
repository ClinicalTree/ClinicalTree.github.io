_Expert Differential Diagnosis: Ultrasound_ is the sixth title in the highly acclaimed Expert Differential Diagnoses (EXPERTddx) series, a unique print-and-electronic reference that guides radiologists toward logical, on-target differential diagnoses based on key imaging findings and clinical information. It is a carefully catalogued and gorgeously illustrated reference book totaling 550 pages representing the latest in ultrasound imaging from Amirsys. The book presents the most useful differential diagnoses in ultrasound, grouped into a specific comprehensive list of anatomical sites including: head and neck, thyroid/parathyroid, liver, biliary system, pancreas, spleen, adrenal gland, kidney, abdominal wall/peritoneal cavity, bladder, prostate, scrotum, female pelvis, vascular, musculoskeletal, and breast. Each differential diagnosis includes at least eight clear, sharp, succinctly annotated images; a list of diagnostic possibilities sorted as common and less common; and brief, bulleted text offering helpful diagnostic clues for each differential. The companion online Amirsys e-Book Advantage provides additional annotated images.

_Expert Differential Diagnosis: Ultrasound_ focuses on the building blocks of ultrasound diagnosis. Each differential is discussed in bulleted text that distills the pertinent information down to the essentials, helping practicing radiologists make informed decisions quickly. The authors neatly organize the included entities into likelihood of occurrence with both text excerpts and imaging provided to further differentiate among differential possibilities in ultrasound imaging.

I find _Expert Differential Diagnosis: Ultrasound_ useful for practicing radiologists, radiology residents, fellows, sonographers, and clinicians alike who are interested in the daily practice of ultrasound imaging and as a study guide for people starting to become familiar with ultrasound and its broad application in medical imaging. The most captivating part of the reference is the eBook companion, which allows the authors to add, alter, and update the differential diagnosis lists. This allows for up-to-date information and easy search ability. The eBook is a unique feature of this reference text series that allows book owners to register their reference and easily search for the images and captions online in a similar format as the hardcover text. The online eBook companion offers hundreds of additional images not found in the book. The reference hardcover text can be burdensome to carry around at times and having the online eBook tool available is a quite welcome feature included with purchase. The EXPERTddx: Ultrasound text is more manageable in size, however, in comparison to other reference texts in this series.

_Expert Differential Diagnosis: Ultrasound_ is a great new addition to the successful EXPERTddx series and is designed specifically to help radiologists and clinicians reach reliable conclusions in a practical, easy to use, “go-to” reference. Designed specifically with the busy practitioner in mind, EXPERTddx: Ultrasound guides readers toward on-target differential diagnoses based on key imaging findings and clinical information, making it, in my opinion, today's ultrasound reference book of choice. Each differential is discussed in bulleted text that distills the pertinent information down to the essentials, helping practicing radiologists make informed decisions quickly. This unique reference book will surely become the go-to resource in ultrasound imaging in the academic and clinical setting.
