## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to investigate improving work flow efficiency by shortening the reading time of digital mammograms using a computer-aided reading protocol (CARP) in the screening environment and to increase detection sensitivity using CARP, compared to the current protocol, commonly referred to as the quadrant view (QV).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 200 cases were selected for a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) study to evaluate two image display work flows, CARP and QV, in the screening environment. A Web-based tool was developed for scoring, reporting, and statistical analysis. Cases were scored for and stratified by difficulty. A total of six radiologists of differing levels of training ranging from dedicated mammographers to senior radiology residents participated. Each was timed while interpreting the 200 cases in groups of 50, first using QV and then, after a washout period, using CARP. The data were analyzed using ROC and κ analysis. Interpretation times were also assessed.

## Results

Using QV, readers' average area under the ROC curve was 0.68 (range, 0.54–0.73). Using CARP, readers' average area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (range, 0.66–0.75). There was no statistically significant difference in reader performance using either work flow. However, there was a statistically significant reduction in the average interpretation time of negative cases from 64.7 seconds using QV to 58.8 seconds using CARP.

## Conclusions

CARP determines the display order of regions of interest depending on computer-aided detection findings. This is a variation of traditional computer-aided detection for digital mammography that has the potential to reduce interpretation times of studies with negative findings without significantly affecting sensitivity, thus allowing improved work flow efficiency in the screening environment, in which, in most settings, the majority of cases are negative.

Mammography has been and continues to be valuable in the detection of breast cancer. Because the early detection of a potential malignancy could improve the chance of survival, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 4 and 5 usually proceed to biopsy .

Changes in technology, most notably the advent and rapid adoption of full-field digital mammography, have improved the practice of mammography. However, the move to digital mammography does not come without drawbacks. In the setting of screening mammography interpretation, it has been demonstrated that digital mammograms take more time to read than similar film-screen mammograms .
