## Rationale and Objectives

Radiolabeled tyrosine analogues that have been successfully used in tumor imaging accumulate in tumor cells via an upregulated L-type amino acid transporter system. The anticancer drug melphalan is an L-type amino acid transporter substrate. Therefore, radiolabeled tyrosine analogues may have great potential in evaluating treatment responses to melphalan. In this study, a  99m Tc-labeled tyrosine analogue,  99m Tc tyrosine using N,N′-ethylene-di-L-cysteine (EC) as a chelator, was developed and its potential for noninvasively assessing tumors' early response to melphalan determined.

## Materials and Methods

EC-tyrosine was synthesized in a three-step procedure and labeled with  99m Tc. To assess cellular uptake kinetics, the percentage uptake of  99m Tc-EC-tyrosine in the rat breast cancer cell line 13762 was measured. Planar imaging was performed in rats with 13762 cell-derived tumors. To determine the transport mechanisms of  99m Tc-EC-tyrosine, a competitive inhibition study using L-tyrosine as an inhibitor was performed in vitro and in vivo. To assess tumors' response to melphalan, tumor-bearing rats were treated with different doses of melphalan, and planar imaging was performed 0 and 3 days after treatment. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to determine expressions of L-type amino acid transporter 1 and cellular proliferation marker Ki-67.

## Results

L-tyrosine significantly inhibited  99m Tc-EC-tyrosine uptake in vitro and in vivo. Tumor volume decreased in a dose-dependent manner with melphalan, and tumor/muscle ratios of  99m Tc-EC-tyrosine were significantly reduced in treated groups. Immunohistochemical data indicated that about 70% of tumor cells in the melphalan-treated groups underwent apoptosis, and the changes in tumor/muscle ratios reflected the decreased percentage of viable cells in treated tumors.

## Conclusions

These findings suggest that  99m Tc-EC-tyrosine has great potential for monitoring tumor response to melphalan in breast tumor–bearing rats.

Currently,  18 F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose (  18 F-FDG) is the most commonly used radiotracer in positron emission tomography (PET) for tumor detection and staging. However, it has several limitations that can give rise to false-positive and false-negative diagnoses. For instance, it has poor contrast in brain tumors because of the high glucose uptake in normal and neoplastic brain tissues . For breast cancer, whole-body  18 F-FDG PET is not quite suitable for primary breast cancer diagnosis, especially for low-grade tumors and those <1 cm in diameter . In addition,  18 F-FDG PET is not sensitive enough in detecting early-stage micrometastases and small tumor–infiltrated axillary lymph nodes .

Therefore, radiolabeled amino acids have been developed as alternatives to  18 F-FDG. Their application in tumor detection is based on the increased uptake of amino acids in tumor cells, which is presumed to reflect enhanced amino acid transporter expression, metabolism, and protein synthesis. The uptake of amino acids in macrophages and other inflammatory cells is lower than that of glucose analogue  18 F-FDG; thus, amino acid–based radiotracers are considered more specific than  18 F-FDG . Aromatic radiolabeled amino acids such as tyrosine and its derivatives are more suitable given their more readily chemical modifications and more favorable biologic characterizations. To date, tyrosine and its α-methyl-substituted analogue α-methyl tyrosine (AMT) have been successfully labeled with  11 C,  18 F, and  124/125 I for PET and with  123/131 I for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) . Most of these radiolabeled tyrosine analogues have shown promising preclinical and clinical results, particularly in brain tumor staging. They have also been successfully applied to breast cancer imaging. For instance,  11 C-labeled tyrosine appears to be better than  18 F-FDG because of its lower uptake in noncancerous fibrocystic disease . Radiolabeled tyrosine analogues have been found to accumulate in tumor cells, predominantly via the L-type amino acid transporter (LAT) system, which is the only system that can transport large neutral amino acids with aromatic rings . LAT, especially its subtype LAT1, is an ideal target for tumor imaging because it is upregulated and highly expressed in many cancer cell lines, and its expression is positively correlated with tumor growth . In fact, LAT1 has been determined as a prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer, even in those with triple-negative breast cancer .
