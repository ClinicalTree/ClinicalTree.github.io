## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of relative sensitivity (reader without computer-aided detection \[CAD\] vs stand-alone CAD) and reading mode on reader performance when using CAD software.

## Materials and Methods

Two sets of 100 images (low-contrast and high-contrast sets) were created by adding low-contrast or high-contrast simulated masses to random locations in 100 normal mammograms. This produced a relative sensitivity, substantially less for the low-contrast set and similar for the high-contrast set. Seven readers reviewed every image in each set and specified location and probability scores using three reading modes (without CAD, second read with CAD, and concurrent read with CAD). Reader detection accuracy was analyzed using areas under free-response receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and the number of false-positive findings per image.

## Results

For the low-contrast set, average differences in areas under free-response receiver operating characteristic curves, sensitivity, and false-positive findings per image without CAD were 0.02, 0.12, and 0.11, respectively, compared to second read and 0.05, 0.17, and 0.09 (not statistically significant), respectively, compared to concurrent read. For the high-contrast set, average differences were 0.002 (not statistically significant), 0.04, and 0.05, respectively, compared to second read and −0.004 (not statistically significant), 0.04, and 0.08 (not statistically significant), respectively, compared to concurrent read (all differences were statistically significant except as noted). Differences were greater in the low-contrast set than the high-contrast set. Differences between second read and concurrent read were not significant.

## Conclusions

Relative sensitivity is a critical factor that determines incremental improvement in reader performance when using CAD and appears to be more important than reading mode. Relative sensitivity may determine the clinical usefulness of CAD in different clinical applications and for different types of users.

Mammographic interpretation is a difficult and complex task that essentially determines the need for follow-up or biopsy . When interpreting screening mammograms, the task of the radiologist is to detect and analyze findings rapidly and only spend significant time analyzing difficult findings, if any. On average, in approximately 20% of patients with breast cancer, the cancer will be “missed” on mammographic examination . Some breast cancers are simply not mammographically visible, and breast cancers that are mammographically visible can still be missed by radiologists because of cognitive, perceptual, technical or administrative errors or some combination thereof . Even palpable breast cancers may not be mammographically visible . The limitations of mammography have been extensively discussed in the literature, including the fact that interpretive variability among radiologists represents a significant factor in breast cancer detection. The sensitivity of screening mammography ranges from approximately 60% to 100%, with specificity ranging from 35% to 98% . Small masses (particularly in patients with dense breasts) account for the vast majority of “missed cancers,” and the detection sensitivity for lesions of all types will be lower for less experienced radiologists .

Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems were introduced in mammography practice in 1998. These systems were developed to reduce errors of detection by drawing readers' attention to areas that the software identifies as containing potential abnormalities. CAD software operates by placing “prompts” or “marks” on the mammographic images. Many studies have been conducted to determine the sensitivity of CAD software in the absence of a radiologist to correctly place marks over true abnormalities (i.e., stand-alone CAD sensitivity) as well as the stand-alone false-positive (FP) mark rate. Stand-alone testing of mammographic CAD devices has revealed high sensitivity to mark microcalcifications (approximately 95% or higher) but much lower sensitivity (approximately 70%) to mark masses. At the same time, stand-alone testing of CAD devices has revealed an FP mark rate of between two and four marks per patient (i.e., 0.5 to 1.0 marks per view of a four-view mammogram). Stand-alone testing was initially used to estimate the potential reduction of detection errors by radiologists when using CAD in clinical practice.
