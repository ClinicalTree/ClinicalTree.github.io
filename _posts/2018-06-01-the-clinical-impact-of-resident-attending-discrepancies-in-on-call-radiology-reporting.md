## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study is to quantify the clinical impact of resident-attending discrepancies at a tertiary referral academic radiology residency program by assessing rates of intervention, discrepancy confirmation, recall rate, and management change rate; furthermore, a discrepancy categorization system will be assessed.

## Materials and Methods

Retrospective review of the records was performed for _n_ = 1482 discrepancies that occurred in the 17-month study period to assess the clinical impact of discrepancies. Discrepancies were grouped according to a previously published classification system. Management changes were recorded and grouped by severity. The recall rate was estimated for discharged patients. Any confirmatory testing was reviewed to evaluate the accuracy of the discrepant report. Categorical variables were compared to the chi-square test.

## Results

The 1482 discrepancies led to management change in 661 cases (44.6%). The most common management change was follow-up imaging. Procedural interventions including surgery occurred in 50 cases (3.3%). The recall rate was 2.6%. Management changes were more severe with computed tomography examinations, inpatients, and when the discrepancy was in the chest and abdomen subspecialty. Also, management changes correlated with the discrepancy category assigned by the attending at the time of review.

## Conclusions

Resident-attending discrepancies do cause management changes in 44.6% of discrepancies (0.62% overall); the most frequent change is follow-up imaging. The discrepancy categorization assigned by the attending correlated with the severity of management change.

## Rationale and Objectives

A fundamental concept in radiology residency training is the development of independence in a paradigm of graded responsibility. In the past, residents obtained this experience working nights for the practice in which their residency was embedded. Although this model persists in many departments, there is an increasing drive to a 24-hour coverage model with an attending radiologist, even subspecialty radiologist, providing direct resident supervision and final signing throughout the night. This model poses a challenge to fostering independence in residency, particularly in the early years of training.

One of the strongest arguments for the 24-hour attending coverage is the need to avoid resident-attending discrepancies that lead to significant changes in management, particularly for discharged or critically ill patients. Although this justification is inherently reasonable, it is easy to overemphasize its importance when the true impact of discrepancies is not well defined. Previous studies have determined what the discrepancy rates are in several resident practice environments . Others have shown that discrepancy rates are correlated with duration of shift and vary with different imaging study types .
