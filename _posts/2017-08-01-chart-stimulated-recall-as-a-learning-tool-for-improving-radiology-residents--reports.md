## Rationale and Objectives

Workplace-based assessments gauge the highest tier of clinical competence. Chart-stimulated recall (CSR) is a workplace-based assessment method that complements chart audit with an interview based on the residents' notes. It allows evaluation of the residents' knowledge and heuristics while providing opportunities for feedback and self-reflection. We evaluated the utility of CSR for improving the radiology residents' reporting skills.

## Materials and Methods

Residents in each year of training were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( _n_ = 12) or a control group ( _n_ = 13). Five pre-intervention and five post-intervention reports of each resident were independently evaluated by three blinded reviewers using a modified Bristol Radiology Report Assessment Tool. The study intervention comprised a CSR interview tailored to each individual resident's learning needs based on the pre-intervention assessment. The CSR process focused on the clinical relevance of the radiology reports. Student's _t_ test ( _P_ < .05) was used to compare pre- and post-intervention scores of each group.

## Results

A total of 125 pre-intervention and 125 post-intervention reports were evaluated (total 750 assessments). The Cronbach's alpha for the study tool was 0.865. A significant improvement was seen in the cumulative 19-item score (66% versus 73%, _P_ < .001) and the global rating score (59% versus 72%, _P_ < .001) of the intervention group after the CSR. The reports of the control group did not demonstrate any significant improvement.

## Conclusion

CSR is a feasible workplace-based assessment method for improving reporting skills of the radiology residents.

## Introduction

Over the last two decades, there has been a progressive shift toward outcome-orientated medical education . Assessment plays an essential role in identifying the residents' learning needs and guiding their learning efforts . The type and the frequency of assessment should match the objectives of the training program. Workplace-based assessment (WPBA) gauges the real-life practices of the residents, which represent the highest tier of clinical competence . A number of WPBA methods have been developed including Mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise, Direct Observation of Procedural Skills, chart audits, and chart-stimulated recall (CSR) .

Chart audits have been recommended by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education as part of the practice-based learning to improve the patients' care . The patient's chart is an excellent source of information about the residents' clinical practices. However, the residents' heuristics have to be deduced during a chart audit. According to one estimate, chart audits are only 70% specific when compared to the quality of care assessments by the standardized patients .

> _**Faculty:** The clinical history is shortness of breath. What should the clinician understand if your conclusion is “hilar vascular congestion?” What steps should the clinician take based on your conclusion?__**Resident** : I was implying that the patient has inflammation, possibly infection.__**Faculty** : Let's discuss the findings on a chest radiograph associated with infection and how can we clearly communicate these findings to the referring physician._
