## Rationale and Objectives

To compare contrast-enhanced coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 3.0 T with the same technique performed at 1.5 T using the contrast agent gadofosveset.

## Materials and Methods

In this prospective randomized study, 19 healthy male volunteers (mean age 28 years, mean weight 79.8 kg), after signing informed consents, underwent contrast-enhanced inversion recovery three-dimensional fast low angle shot (FLASH) MRA at 1.5 and at 3.0 T. Prospective electrocardiogram-triggering was combined with adaptive respiratory gating. For contrast-enhanced images, the intravascular contrast agent gadofosveset was used. Acquisition time, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of coronary blood, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) between coronaries and adjacent myocardium or epicardial fat and image quality were analyzed for statistical differences by using a two-tailed paired-sample _t_ -test. The ratio calculations were based on measurements performed on the raw data and the image quality was blinded and independently evaluated by two experienced radiologists using a five-point scale.

## Results

The mean values for the acquisition time were 14.58 ± 0.1 minutes at 1.5 T and 16.40 ± 0.2 minutes at 3.0 T. Overall SNR of all evaluated coronary segments proved higher at 3.0 T compared to 1.5 T (74.0 ± 42.1 at 3.0 T vs. 50.2 ± 20.2 at 1.5 T, _P_ = .04). Overall CNR between coronaries and myocardium was significantly increased at 3.0 T in comparison to 1.5 T (40.1 ± 21.9 at 3.0 T vs. 24.4 ± 17.2 at 1.5 T, _P_ = .01). Between the two methods, no significant difference in overall CNR between coronaries and epicardial fat was observed ( _P_ = .08, NS). The 3.0 T MRA demonstrated superior overall image quality with respect to 1.5 T (2.28 ± 0.71 at 3.0 T vs. 1.92 ± 0.38 at 1.5T, _P_ = .004).

## Conclusion

The use of higher field strength, 3.0 T instead of 1.5 T, resulted in similar CNR between coronaries and epicardial fat, higher SNR values and CNR between blood and myocardium, as well as an improved overall image quality, when gadofosveset in combination with electrocardiogram and respiratory triggering for coronary MRA was used.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Recent surveys suggest that three-dimensional whole-heart coronary magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 1.5 T is a promising technique for non-invasive assessment of the coronary arteries . When a contrast-enhanced whole-heart approach is used, electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory triggering require a contrast agent that enables increased blood signal intensity for a longer period than the first pass of an extravascular contrast agent. In theory, field strength of 3.0 T offers an almost twofold higher signal intensity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), than a 1.5 T system, if the same pulse sequence technique is used . In contrast to a steady-state free-precession (SSFP) readout technique, a spoiled gradient-echo sequence, such as fast low-angle shot (FLASH), proved relatively insensitive to the increased field inhomogeneities of 3.0 T .

Various contrast agents have been used at 3.0T in previous investigations for coronary MRA, such as gadopentetate dimeglumine or gadobenate dimeglumine . The intravascular contrast media provide long time windows for coronary MRA acquisition because of prolonged plasma half-life and slow extravasation in the interstitial space .
