Radiologists in teaching hospitals and in practices with residents rotating through are involved in the education of their residents. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires evidence that trainees are taught and demonstrate competency not only in medical knowledge and in patient care—the historic focus of radiology education—but also in the so-called non-interpretative core competencies, which include professionalism and interpersonal skills. In addition to accreditation agencies, the prominent assessment practices represented by the American Board of Radiology core and certifying examinations for trainees, as well as Maintenance of Certification for practitioners, are planning to feature more non-interpretative competency assessment, including professionalism to a greater extent. Because professionalism was incorporated as a required competency in medical education as a whole, more clarity about the justification and expected content for teaching about competence in professionalism, as well as greater understanding and evidence about appropriate and effective teaching and assessment methods, have emerged. This article summarizes justifications and expectations for teaching and assessing professionalism in radiology residents and best practices on how to teach and evaluate professionalism that can be used by busy radiology faculty in their everyday practice supervising radiology residents.

## Introduction

We are now in the age of managed health care and Accountable Care Organizations, which encourages specialties such as radiology to demonstrate the added value of the services we provide. In the context of changed expectations for health care, changes mandated for health profession education included competencies beyond the traditional focus on trainees' acquisition of medical knowledge . The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) specifically targets professionalism as a competency that training programs are required to teach and assess. Radiology's established tradition of education—defining and fostering competency in medical knowledge and patient care (the traditional interpretative skills emphasized in radiology education)—facilitates our ability to define the content and scope of our curricula, as well as share best practices in assessing progress on predictable milestones and competency attainment of our trainees. In contrast, formulating teaching and assessment in the essential “non-interpretative skill” of professionalism has posed challenges to medical education. We learned that challenges medical education encountered in teaching professionalism included diffuse and disparate definitions of professionalism; variability in trainees' experience and opportunity to reflect on professionalism; discrepancies between professionalism in explicitly planned curriculum and informal experience; and findings that faculty are less likely to explicitly articulate and share their standards for professionalism, let alone observe and provide constructive feedback to trainees on their progress in achieving competence in professionalism.

Moreover, generational differences emerge between young trainees, new faculty, and senior practicing radiologists, which along with technology are casting a different light on professional values and beliefs. As trainees mature and gain knowledge and autonomy, their learning and feedback preferences will also change and evolve; educators need to keep these factors in mind. Our collective experiments and experience have also enabled us to share lessons learned for strategic and effective education.

In the first article of this series, the authors outlined how the construct of medical professionalism has evolved, including pivotal historical events precipitating expectations for the practice and teaching of professionalism . In that paper, the authors share their insights on the teaching and assessment of professionalism in radiology trainees, supported by a literature review on more successful strategies. Multiple examples of opportunities and ways for readers to teach and assess professionalism to trainees in their radiology practices are provided.

## Why Should We Teach Professionalism? Sharing the Message with Our Faculty and Trainees

There is an explosion in the volume of literature and media coverage on medical professionalism owing to a perceived decline in professional values and behaviors among physicians . The teaching of professionalism also represents a regulatory and certification requirement, as well as the ethical thing to do.

The teaching of professionalism has assumed a more central place within graduate (medical school) and post-graduate (residency programs) medical education in recent years. There are many reasons underlying the teaching of medical professionalism, which include the medical professions' commitment to address prior transgressions and to prevent their occurrence in the future. In addition, the teaching of professionalism allows us to be transparent and to assure the public, patients, and allied professions that we value professionalism highly and take it seriously. Radiologists should emphasize, model, and teach professionalism to our colleagues and trainees, whenever opportunity permits.

Table 5


Example Components for Objective Structured Clinical Examinations in Professionalism for Radiology Residents


Scenario or Case Study Source Informing Competency Expectations It is 4:55 PM, Friday, you are asked to protocol a CTPE CT and indirect CTV on a 26-year-old woman who had a CTPE and CTV study 3 days ago (which was negative for PE and DVT, but showed pneumonia). You suspect that if you try to cancel this examination, the ER physicians will go to your on-call resident colleague or a senior faculty, who will tell the resident to do it anyway. What do you do? Imaging appropriateness, patient safety, radiation protection The patient for the breast biopsy comes down from the ward and has already taken her pre-procedure valium. You are the resident on the service and it is your job to consent her. She seems a bit drowsy and groggy. She is happy to sign it and asks you to “Please get it all over and done with.” What do you do? Elements of voluntary informed consent You see a spiculated nodule on a chest radiograph or mammogram, and looking at the old studies, it was there a year ago but it was not mentioned in the report. How do you report the study? What do you do? ACR Communication Guideline A patient with liver metastases on US (who seems well informed about her disease in general) asks you (the resident) what are the findings, when you return to the room. The attending radiologist has “popped off to their office for a minute or two.” What do you do? Do you tell her? Resident responsibilities, responsibility of supervising faculty, communication You are the resident in MRI and the clerk hands you the phone, saying it is the patient herself asking about her MRI result on her study done 4 days ago. What do you tell her? What do you say? Communication, HIPAA At the conclusion of a procedure, the interventional radiologist asks the technologist to list a catheter for billing purposes that was not actually used. This will bolster up the reimbursement to the hospital. What do you do? Appropriate documentation, Appropriate billing, honesty, fraud prevention You are a resident on the interventional service and the patient refuses to have his or her angiogram done by you. You have already rotated twice through angiography and have done more than 60 diagnostic angiograms (including 15 therapeutic interventions). What do you do? Patient rights, voluntary informed consent The technologist informs you that they accidentally gave intravenous contrast for the chest CT study but noticed afterward that the study was supposed to be a low-dose, non-contrast nodule CT protocol. The prescribing radiologist's handwriting was not legible. What do you do? Communication, openness, disclosure, transparency, honesty
