## Rationale and Objectives

The purposes of this study were to retrospectively identify various etiologies underlying intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs) in term infants aged <2 years and their respective prevalence in this population and to describe the long-term clinical outcomes in these patients.

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective review of the medical records and computed tomographic studies of the head in 798 term infants aged 0 to 24 months with suspected or known ICHs was conducted.

## Results

ICHs were present in 195 of the 798 infants (24%). More than one type of ICH was present in 32%. Subdural hemorrhage was the most frequent type of ICH, occurring in 63% of the infants. Good clinical outcomes were present in 49% of the infants but varied depending on the location, etiology, and timing of the ICH.

## Conclusion

The incidence of various etiologies of ICH depended on the ages of the infants. The overall clinical outcomes were good, with no long-term sequelae in half of the infants presenting with ICHs. In infants aged >4 weeks presenting with ICHs, special attention should be given to the possibility of nonaccidental trauma etiology, because this is common and has worse long-term outcomes.

The list of etiologies of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in the full-term infant population is long, with trauma being the most common etiology and the most common cause of morbidity and mortality . This list includes, among other entities, veno-occlusive disease, cerebrovascular accidents, sepsis, liver failure or platelet abnormalities, and tumors. Infants are at special risk for ICH from head trauma because of the thinness and increased pliability of their skulls. Previous studies have shown that even asymptomatic neonates can have ICHs following vaginal delivery , with one study finding a prevalence of 26% on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging . Besides trauma, many other causes of ICHs have been described , but to our knowledge, no data on prevalence are available in the literature.

The finding of ICH in the full-term infant population is typically made by ultrasound. However, over the past decade, there has been an increase in the use of computed tomography (CT) of the head in pediatric patients in emergency departments , including a 23% increase in the infant population . Besides its wide availability and low cost, the benefit of head CT lies in the early diagnosis of head trauma, which can reduce both morbidity and mortality.
