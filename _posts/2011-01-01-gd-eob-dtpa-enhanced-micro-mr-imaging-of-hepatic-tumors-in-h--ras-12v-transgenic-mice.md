## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to evaluate the morphologic characteristics and growth pattern of hepatic tumors in H- _ras_ 12V transgenic (TG) mice using a micro–magnetic resonance (MR) system and to assess the usefulness of gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) enhancement for the detection of hepatic tumors in these mice.

## Materials and Methods

Hepatocellular carcinoma lines were established to allow insertion of the H- _ras_ 12V transgene under the control of the albumin enhancer/promoter. Seven H- _ras_ 12V TG mice and four wild-type mice were included in this study. The mice underwent various MR imaging examinations, including T1-weighted imaging (repetition time, 300 ms; echo time, 11 ms), Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (dose, 0.025 mmol/kg), and T2-weighted imaging (repetition time, 3500 ms; echo time, 36 ms), with a 4.7-T MR scanner, at 4, 6, 8, and 9 months of age. All mice were euthanized after the final MR imaging procedure, except for one TG mouse and two wild-type mice that were euthanized after MR imaging procedures at 4 months of age. For imaging analysis, the tumor characteristics in each MR sequence, including tumor size, number, and signal intensity (SI), were recorded, and the contrast-to-noise ratio and contrast enhancement ratio were calculated to quantify the SI of the tumor. The MR images were correlated with the findings of histopathologic examinations.

## Results

No tumors were detected in the four wild-type mice. In the six TG mice, a total of 67 tumors were found in histopathologic specimens obtained at 9 months of age. Of the 67 tumors, 62 were detected on Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images with fat saturation. The majority of hepatic tumors showed high SI on T1-weighted images without fat saturation. The SI diminished on T1-weighted images with fat saturation. The tumor contrast-to-noise ratio for Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted imaging was significantly better than that for the other sequences. The tumors were histopathologically confirmed as hepatocellular adenomas ( _n_ = 32) and well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas ( _n_ = 35).

## Conclusions

Micro-MR imaging can reveal the characteristics of hepatic tumors in a live murine model. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted imaging is helpful in the detection of hepatic tumors in H- _ras_ 12V TG mice.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy in humans . Mutations of the _ras_ gene have been detected in many human tumors. This gene encodes a small, signal-transducing guanosine triphosphatase that regulates the signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival . Although _ras_ mutations are rare in human liver tumors , receptor-mediated hyperactivation of _ras_ -dependent signal transduction pathways frequently occurs in human hepatocarcinogenesis . The three types of _ras_ include N- _ras_ , K- _ras_ , and H- _ras_ . Among these, murine HCCs express H- _ras_ , which is activated in 70% of these cases; this finding suggests that H- _ras_ plays a key role in hepatocarcinogenesis . Recently, H- _ras_ transgenic (TG) mice were generated by using an H- _ras_ 12V construct with a mouse albumin enhancer/promoter . The H- _ras_ 12V TG mouse has 2 main advantages: (1) liver-specific expression and (2) long-term survival because of low expression levels of H- _ras_ .

In vivo imaging technologies provide a unique opportunity for noninvasive and quantitative molecular-level analyses of diseases and for repeated and noninvasive monitoring of disease progression and/or response to treatment. The currently used small-animal model imaging technologies include magnetic resonance (MR), radionuclide imaging, computed tomography, ultrasonography, and optical imaging . Among these modalities, micro-MR imaging affords good microscopic resolution (micrometer-range resolution) and provides tissue-specific information when used with tissue-specific contrast agents . Tissue-specific liver MR imaging is useful for detecting and characterizing tumors. Hepatocyte-specific contrast agents are preferred over reticuloendothelial cell–specific contrast agents because the former offer superior tumor detection and lesion discrimination in murine hepatic tumors . In addition, the differences in the enhancement shown by hepatocyte-specific contrast agents can indicate additional tumor differentiation .
