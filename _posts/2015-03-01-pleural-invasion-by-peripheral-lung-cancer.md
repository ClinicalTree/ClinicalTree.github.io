## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the clinical utility of three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) for predicting pleural invasion by peripheral lung cancer.

## Materials and Methods

CT findings (tumor size, vertical diameter, length and area of the interface between tumor and the pleura, ratios of length and area \[R  area \] of interface between tumor and the pleura to tumor size, angle between the tumor and adjacent pleura, presence or absence of pleural thickening, and originally developed 3D pleural patterns) in 201 consecutive patients with lung cancer of ≤3 cm in contact with pleural surface were correlated with pathologic findings. Logistic modeling was used for determining the significant factors for prediction of pleural invasion, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used for investigating diagnostic capability of significant factors, resulting in a recommendation to the optimal criteria for predicting pleural invasion and to the optimal threshold for differentiating parietal from visceral invasion.

## Results

Sixty-one (30%) of the 201 patients had pathologically verified pleural invasion. Logistic modeling revealed that the 3D pleural pattern was the only significant factor ( _P_ < .001; relative risk of 7.34). Among every combination of the 3D patterns, skirt-like pattern showed the highest accuracy of 77% for predicting pleural invasion. In differentiating parietal from visceral pleural invasion, ROC analysis revealed that R  area was optimal for differentiating parietal from visceral pleural invasion, and the highest accuracy of 77% was obtained with a cut-off value of 13.4 for this criterion.

## Conclusions

Computer-aided 3D CT analysis of the pleura was useful for predicting pleural invasion.

The anatomic extent of disease as expressed by the tumor, node, and metastasis staging system is the most important prognostic factor for lung cancer. Presence of visceral pleural invasion by lung cancer increases T staging from T1 to T2, and the presence of parietal pleural invasion upstages it from T2 to T3, when the tumor is <3 cm in size . Therefore, prognosis of patients with T1-sized (≤3 cm) lung cancer depends on the presence or absence of pleural invasion and the depth of invasion of the pleura . Five-year survival rates are reported to worsen from 86% (for patients with no pleural invasion) to 62%–70% (for patients with visceral pleural invasion) and then to 57% (for patients with parietal pleural invasion) for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) .

Computed tomography (CT) is currently the imaging method of choice in staging of lung cancer. However, a well-known limitation of conventional CT is the diagnosis of pleural invasion by peripheral lung cancer. Sensitivity in diagnosing invasion of the parietal pleura or chest wall based on two-dimensional (2D) CT is reported to range from 38% to 89.7% and specificity from 40% to 96% . However, the visceral pleural invasion is difficult to diagnose with CT and has not been assessed in detail, especially in patients with T1-sized lung cancer. Thin-section spiral CT allows continuous data collection and provides uninterrupted volume data that can be reconstructed to produce three-dimensional (3D) images, which have been reported to be superior to 2D CT in the assessment of pleural invasion by lung cancer .

![Figure 1, Method of calculation of the area of interface between tumor and the pleura. Transverse computed tomography (CT) image shows a lobulated pulmonary nodule in contact with the chest wall (a) . First, we manually drew the interface ( black line ) between tumor and the pleura in all transverse CT sections (b) and next calculated the volume of all the voxels ( yellow squares ) that comprise the volume of the interface between tumor and the pleura as shown in an illustration (c) and then the volume was divided by a voxel size of y-axis of CT images. This value was defined as the area of the interface in our study.

(a) Flat pattern: flat pleura without any morphologic changes in the adjacent pleura is seen on both lateral (a-1) and top views (a-2) . (b) Waving pattern: wrinkled pleura without pleural indrawn thickening toward tumor is seen on both top (b-1) and acute angle views (b-2) . (c) Rectangular solid pattern: indrawn pleural thickening without associated pleural wrinkling of the indrawn pleura. Its shape looks rectangular solid. (c-1) represents a lateral view of the broad side of the indrawn pleura and another view at right angle of c-1 shows a narrow side (c-2) . No wrinkles are seen in the indrawn pleura. (d) Skirt-like pattern: indrawn pleural thickening associated with wrinkling of the indrawn pleura is seen on a lateral view (d-1) and it looks similar on another lateral view (d-2) at right angle to d-1 . Arrowheads indicate neighboring pleura and stars show pulmonary nodules.
