## Rationale and Objectives

To explore whether strain ratio measurement could semi-quantitatively evaluate the stiffness of breast lesions.

## Materials and Methods

From January 2008 to May 2008, 148 patients with 254 solid lesions (183 benign, 71 malignant) in the breast were included in the study. Ultrasound sonography found the lesions and ultrasonic elastography obtained the strain images. By using the strain ratio measurement method together with the ultrasound machine, the strain index of the lesion was calculated. Different depths of breast tissue were selected as the reference. The strain indexes of malignant and benign solid lesions were calculated with the same level of breast tissue as the reference.

## Results

The strain indexes of breast lesions were different compared to the same depth of breast tissue and the superior level of fat tissue ( _P_ = 0.000). The strain indexes of breast lesions were different compared to different depths of breast glandular tissues ( _P_ = 0.003). At the same level of the breast lesions, 212 lesions were glandular tissue, 11 were fat tissue, and 40 were both. In the lesion plane, six lesions had almost no glandular tissue and 20 had almost no superior fat tissue. Compared to the same depth of breast tissue, the strain indexes of benign lesions (range, 0.62–11.07) and malignant lesions (range, 3.12–39.28) were different ( _P_ = 0.000).

## Conclusion

Using the strain ratio measurement, stiffness of breast lesions could be semi-quantitated with the same depth of breast tissue as the reference. This method may provide another diagnostic method in addition to the 5-point scoring system used with ultrasonic elastography in the future.

An important property of tissues is their intrinsic elasticity, which may change under the influence of pathophysiologic processes, such as tumor development ( ). This property serves as the basis for the oldest and most frequently used physical examination method for detecting breast cancers—palpation. Harder and less mobile lesions are considered more likely to be malignant ( ). Unfortunately, palpation is a highly subjective method and depends on the size and location of the lesion and on the skill of the practitioner. These changes in elasticity drove the development of elasticity measurement, which began in the 1980s ( ).

Elastography is a newly developed dynamic technique that uses ultrasound (US) to provide an estimation of tissue elasticity by measuring the degree of distortion under the application of an external force ( ). The principle of elastography is that tissue compression produces displacement within the tissue and that the displacement is smaller in harder tissue than in softer tissue. Real-time ultrasonic elastography (UE) allows calculation of tissue elasticity in real time and, similar to color Doppler, superimposes the information in color on the B-mode image. Different color represents different elasticity. Blue is hard, red is soft, and green is median. Although UE is not yet used in routine clinical practice, it has been shown to be useful in the differential diagnosis of breast cancer ( ), thyroid cancer ( ), and prostate cancer ( ), and attempts have been made to use it in the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis ( ).
