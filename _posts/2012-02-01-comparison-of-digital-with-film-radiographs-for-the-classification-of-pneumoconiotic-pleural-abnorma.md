## Rationale and Objectives

Analog film radiographs are typically used to classify pneumoconiosis to allow comparison with standard film radiographs. The aim of this study was to determine if digital radiography is comparable to film for the purpose of classifying pneumoconiotic pleural abnormalities.

## Materials and Methods

Subjects were 200 asbestos-exposed patients, from whom digital and film chest radiographs were obtained along with chest high-resolution computed tomographic scans. Using a crossover design, radiographs were independently read on two occasions by seven readers, using conventional International Labour Organization standards for film and digitized standards for digital. High-resolution computed tomographic scans were read independently by three readers. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were calculated using high-resolution computed tomographic ratings as the gold standard for disease status. Mixed linear models were fit to estimate the effects of order of presentation, occasion, and modality, treating the seven readers as a random effect. Comparing digital and film radiography for each reader and occasion, crude agreement and agreement beyond chance (κ) were also calculated.

## Results

The linear models showed no statistically significant sequence effect for order of presentation ( _P_ = .73) or occasion ( _P_ = .28). Most important, the difference between modalities was not statistically significant (digital vs film, _P_ = .54). The mean area under the curve for film was 0.736 and increased slightly to 0.741 for digital. Mean crude agreement for the presence of pleural abnormalities consistent with pneumoconiosis across all readers and occasions was 78.3%, while the mean κ value was 0.49.

## Conclusions

These results indicate that digital radiography is not statistically different from analog film for the purpose of classifying pneumoconiotic pleural abnormalities, when appropriate standards are used.

The respiratory system is the most important route of entry for occupational exposure to particulates . Inhalation exposure to inorganic particulates may result in one of many occupational respiratory diseases collectively known as pneumoconioses . Chest radiographs were commonly used to detect pneumoconiosis throughout much of the 20th century. Worldwide, radiographs used to detect pneumoconiosis are typically coded using the International Labour Organization (ILO) classification , which requires comparison with a set of standard radiographs. This standard set consists of 22 radiographs, providing differing types in terms of shape, size, and severity of abnormalities that were identified in patients with pneumoconiosis. The ILO classification system currently requires the use of analog films, given the previous limited availability of digital standard radiographs . However, most radiology departments in the United States have transitioned from the use of film in recent years. This has been due to several advantages of digital radiography, including decreased processing time, remote reading capability, and enhanced image quality compared to film. This widespread adoption of digital radiography in many countries has created a need to validate its use for classifying pneumoconiosis.

Only a small number of validation studies have been conducted, but their results suggest that digital radiography is a suitable replacement for film for classifying parenchymal abnormalities . Of these studies, two examined the adequacy of digital radiography for classifying pleural abnormalities . However, neither study used a gold standard for the presence of abnormalities, leaving it unclear which modality was superior.
