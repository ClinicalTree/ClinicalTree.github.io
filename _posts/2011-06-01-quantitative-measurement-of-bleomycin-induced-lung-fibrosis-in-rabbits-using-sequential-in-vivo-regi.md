## Rationale and Objectives

To examine the feasibility of quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings to monitor the stage of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rabbits by correlating HRCT and pathologic scores and analyzing sequential changes on HRCT images using regional volume histograms.

## Materials and Methods

Lung fibrosis was induced by injecting bleomycin intratracheally into 23 Japanese white rabbits. Rabbits were randomly separated into seven groups depending on follow-up period (12-hour, 24-hour, 3-day, 7-day, 14-day, 21-day, and 28-day). Four-row HRCT examinations were performed at any of the seven time points in each follow-up period and just after bleomycin administration in addition to pre-bleomycin administration as the baseline scan. Scores of consolidation, homogenous ground-glass opacity (GGO), inhomogeneous GGO, reticulolinear shadow, and honey-comb formation were recorded as ratio of affected area to total cross-section in four transaxial planes. Inflammatory and fibrous changes were scored histopathologically. Correlations between HRCT and pathologic findings were assessed. Sequential changes on HRCT images in areas with pathologically confirmed fibrosis were assessed on volume histograms of cubic regions of interest (ROI) using quantitative parameters.

## Results

Consolidation and inhomogeneous GGO exhibited fair correlations with inflammation scores ( _r_ = 0.273, _P_ = .009, and _r_ = 0.393, _P_ < .001); reticulolinear shadow and inhomogeneous GGO had a fair and good correlation, respectively, with fibrous scores ( _r_ = 0.327, _P_ = .001, and _r_ = 0.579, _P_ < .001). Inhomogeneous GGO was hardly detected on regional images at 21 and 28 days after bleomycin administration. As to mean computed tomography attenuation, skewness, and kurtosis, inhomogeneous GGO differed from reticulolinear shadow and consolidation.

## Conclusion

Using appropriate ROI settings, quantitative assessment of inhomogeneous GGO with regional volume histograms enables us to monitor the progression of lung fibrosis by sequential observations.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive and fatal lung disease; average survival from the time of diagnosis ranges from 3 to 5 years . It is the most common form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and is associated with a pathologic pattern known as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Typical high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings of IPF are reticular abnormality, subpleural honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis of spatially patchy distribution with minimal ground-glass opacity (GGO) . The underlying etiology of IPF and its optimal treatment remain to be identified .

Although the pathogenesis of IPF is not completely understood, proposed factors are injury to the alveolar epithelium followed by not only persistent inflammatory stimulation but also lymphocyte-monocyte interactions that sustain the production of growth factors such as tumor growth factor-β1 , proteolytic enzymes such as arginase-1 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase , and pro-fibrotic cytokines such as interleukin-4 and 13 under the influence of a T  H 2 to T  H 1 response . The deposition of connective tissue elements that progressively remodel and destroy the normal tissue architecture plays an important role.
