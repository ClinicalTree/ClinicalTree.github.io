In an era of rapid technological advancement, the chest radiograph remains not only one of the most frequently performed imaging exams, but also among the most challenging to interpret. For three decades, James C. Reed's pattern-based _Chest Radiology: Plain Film Patterns and Differential Diagnoses_ has been highly regarded for its ability to teach the art of chest radiograph interpretation. This tradition continues with further refinements in the book's sixth edition.

The framework of the book retains its popular and effective pattern-based structure that deconstructs the art of interpretation into 23 main patterns. These patterns form the basis of the book's 23 chapters. Each chapter begins with illustrative case-based questions designed to engage the reader and offer a taste of not only the chapter contents but also the challenges seen in clinical practice. This is followed by a chart that offers a detailed differential diagnosis for the imaging pattern, a discussion of the important features involved in recognizing and classifying the pattern, and a concise yet comprehensive discussion of the relevant disease entities. A new “Top 5 Diagnoses” section has been added to the end of the chapter that emphasizes the importance of short, clinically relevant differential diagnoses. The chapters finish with a summary section that highlights important learning points (a useful section for exam or self-review).

While staying true to its goal of teaching the fundamentals of plain-film chest radiology and mastering pattern recognition, the new edition further incorporates correlative computed tomographic and magnetic resonance images to improve understanding of plain-film findings. It also incorporates more high-quality digital images and offers access to a searchable online version of the text.

As has been admired in prior editions, the writing is concise and accessible. The information is well organized and easy to navigate. The chapters lend themselves to quick scanning for information or a leisurely read. Continued improvement in the images and content of this classic textbook makes this invaluable learning tool a highly recommended text for radiology residents, practicing radiologists, and clinicians seeking to master their skills in chest radiography.
