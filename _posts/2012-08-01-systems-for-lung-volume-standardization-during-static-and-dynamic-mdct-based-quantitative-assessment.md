## Rationale and Objectives

Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has emerged as a tool for quantitative assessment of parenchymal destruction, air trapping (density metrics), and airway remodeling (metrics relating airway wall and lumen geometry) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Critical to the accuracy and interpretability of these MDCT-derived metrics is the assurance that the lungs are scanned during a breathhold at a standardized volume.

## Materials and Methods

A computer monitored turbine-based flow meter system was developed to control patient breathholds and facilitate static imaging at fixed percentages of the vital capacity. Because of calibration challenges with gas density changes during multibreath xenon CT, an alternative system was required. The design incorporated dual rolling seal pistons. Both systems were tested in a laboratory environment and human subject trials.

## Results

The turbine-based system successfully controlled lung volumes in 32/37 subjects, having a linear relationship for CT measured air volume between repeated scans: for all scans, the mean and confidence interval of the differences (scan1-scan2) was −9 mL (−169, 151); for total lung capacity alone 6 mL (−164, 177); for functional residual capacity alone, −23 mL (−172, 126). The dual-piston system successfully controlled lung volume in 31/41 subjects. Study failures related largely to subject noncompliance with verbal instruction and gas leaks around the mouthpiece.

## Conclusion

We demonstrate the successful use of a turbine-based system for static lung volume control and demonstrate its inadequacies for dynamic xenon CT studies. Implementation of a dual-rolling seal spirometer has been shown to adequately control lung volume for multibreath wash-in xenon CT studies. These systems coupled with proper patient coaching provide the tools for the use of CT to quantitate regional lung structure and function. The wash-in xenon CT method for assessing regional lung function, although not necessarily practical for routine clinical studies, provides for a dynamic protocol against which newly emerging single breath, dual-energy xenon CT measures can be validated.

## Introduction

Multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) has emerged as a tool for quantitation of parenchymal destruction, air trapping, and airway remodeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma . Critical to the accuracy and interpretability of these metrics is the assurance that the lungs are scanned during a breathhold at a standardized volume . Methods have been reported in which correction factors are proposed for inconsistent lung volumes . However, there is no replacement for accurate control of lung volume at the time of scanning.

In addition to structural-based measurements, wash-in xenon CT enables the measurement of regional ventilation by using the increase in measured density of a region of interest caused by the wash-in of radiodense xenon gas. This method has proved reliable in animal studies , and because the animals were anesthetized the anesthetic properties of xenon were not a problem . Animals were mechanically ventilated, thus it was very straightforward to scan at a repeatable set of respiratory pauses as xenon gas was washed into and out of the lungs. The goal for measuring ventilation in humans is to capture the dynamic nature of ventilation in awake, free-breathing subjects. This therefore necessitates the use of a lower concentration of xenon gas and identifying repeatable pause points in sequential respiratory cycles when axial scans can be acquired. Currently a 30% xenon/70% oxygen mixture is used for safety purposes, though a mixture that also includes krypton would be preferred . However, the introduction of gases of varying densities complicates the tracking of gas flow at the mouth with standard respiratory gas flow meters. With the emergence of dual-energy CT methods for single breath xenon-based assessment of regional lung function have been reported . However, there have been no reports validating these single-breath techniques against a method that assesses true regional ventilation. The dynamic volume control approach presented here provides for such a comparator.

## Turbine-based Dynamic System

![Figure 8, Wash-in xenon computed tomography results. The turbine-based dynamic system fails to maintain a consistent end-expiratory lung volume yielding noisy time versus density curves ( top middle panel ) and incorrect and incomplete color-map data ( top right panel ). The dual-piston system more reliably controls end-expiratory lung volume yielding cleaner time versus density curves ( bottom middle panel ) and accurate and complete color-map data ( bottom right panel ). Note the lower density and slower wash-in time constants ( blue curve, bottom middle panel ) in the nondependent versus dependent ( orange curve, bottom middle panel ) representing a greater lung expansion at functional residual capacity (FRC) and reduced ventilation to this same region in the nondependent lung region. This is in agreement with well-recognized heterogeneity of lung function. Despite the inconsistent lung volumes at FRC achieved by the turbine-based system, the same vertically oriented relationship in lung density is observed within the early time points.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SystemsforLungVolumeStandardizationduringStaticandDynamicMDCTbasedQuantitativeAssessmentofPulmonaryStructureandFunction/7_1s20S1076633212001687.jpg)
