## Rationale and Objectives

To analyze the independent effects of multiple variables on resident call performance.

## Materials and Methods

Independent radiology resident “on call” cross-sectional imaging interpretation quality assurance (QA) data obtained during a 171-day period at a single tertiary care Level 1 trauma teaching institution was reviewed. Clinically significant resident-faculty discrepancies were compared among three different call types: traditional single-day overnight call (OC, 15 hours/night after 9 daytime hours on weekdays), 7-night nightfloat (NF, 9 hours/night), and weekend day call (WD, 10 hours/day). Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations.

## Results

There were 119 (0.89%) clinically significant resident-faculty discordances from 13,424 cross-sectional interpretations: 56 (0.79%) from 7102 interpretations on 172 OC shifts, 39 (0.85%) from 4567 interpretations on 165 NF shifts, and 24 (1.4%) from 1755 interpretations on 49 WD shifts. Individual residents ( _n_ = 20) had a mean discrepancy rate of 0.9% (0.45%–1.9%). Overall, 102 (26.2%) of the shifts had at least one discordance. The following were associated with significantly ( _P_ < .001) increased discrepancy rates: junior vs. senior residents (odds ratio \[OR\] = 1.3 \[1.2–1.4\]), OC vs. NF (OR = 1.5 \[1.3–1.6\], WD vs. NF (OR = 1.4 \[1.2–1.6\]), weekend vs. weekday (OR = 1.3 \[1.2–1.4\]), and increasing cases/hour (OR = 1.6 \[1.5–1.7\]). Weekend OC shifts had a higher discrepancy rate (OR 1.3\[1.2–1.5\], _P_ < .001) than weekday OC shifts despite a shorter workday (15 vs. 24 hours).

## Conclusion

Increasing caseload, junior residents, and weekends are associated with a significantly higher discrepancy rate. OC is associated with a significantly higher discrepancy rate than NF. Measured discrepancy rates are low, regardless of call type.

The landmark study from the Institute of Medicine, _To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System,_ has led to a renewed focus on patient safety . One aspect of this is a reevaluation of resident activities, especially when they are functioning in an independent fashion with less immediate supervision. This attention has in part resulted in new requirements by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which now mandates 12 months of radiology training before radiology residents are allowed to take independent call. Additionally, global resident work hour restrictions (per day and per week) affecting all medical specialties have also been issued by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Many radiology residency programs in the United States have elected to convert their overnight call to a nightfloat system to help cope with these new changes as well as meet the challenges of an ever-increasing volume of radiological studies . Although one study in the literature has reported an improvement in perceived clinical judgment of radiology residents in response to changing overnight call to a nightfloat system , no published data directly compare the effects of nightfloat with overnight call on radiology resident-faculty discordance rates. Complicating this issue are numerous other factors beyond call type that may affect discordances, including continuous work hours, case load, day of the week, and experience level. The large number of confounding variables coupled with an extremely low baseline discordant rate can make it difficult to assess the effect of any one intervention on discordance rates and, by extension, patient care.

The purpose of our study was to analyze the independent effects of work hours, hourly caseload, shift type, residency class, and experience on resident call performance.

QA Grade Meaning 1 Concur with interpretation 2a Difficult diagnosis; not ordinarily expected to be made 2b Non-acute finding that was not in preliminary report but will be mentioned in final report 3 Clinically significant finding or interpretation should be made MOST of the time 4 Finding or interpretation should be made ALMOST EVERY time

QA, quality assurance.
