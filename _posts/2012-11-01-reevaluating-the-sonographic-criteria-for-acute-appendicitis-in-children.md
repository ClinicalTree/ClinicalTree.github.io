## Rationale and Objectives

There has been little rigorous evaluation of the sonographic criteria for acute appendicitis in children. Our clinical experience has called the traditional diagnostic criteria into question. We set out to review the literature, evaluate the most commonly applied diagnostic criteria for acute appendicitis, and identify those criteria that best predict the presence of disease.

## Materials and Methods

A critical review of the literature concerning the sonographic diagnosis of acute appendicitis was performed. Based on diagnostic criteria identified in that review, two independent, blinded pediatric radiologists retrospectively reviewed 246 right lower quadrant ultrasound examinations in which the appendix was identified with attention to commonly described diagnostic criteria for acute appendicitis. Multivariate and classification and regression tree analysis were performed to identify criteria that predict appendicitis.

## Results

In a multivariate analysis, inflammation of the periappendiceal fat is the only finding that statistically significantly predicts acute appendicitis (OR = 68.93, _P_ < .0001). Other criteria such as diameter, noncompressibility, hyperemia, the presence of an appendicolith, and loss of stratification of the appendiceal wall do not independently predict appendicitis.

## Conclusion

Periappendiceal fat infiltration is the most important diagnostic criterion for acute appendicitis in children. Strict application of other criteria such as diameter should be avoided.

Sonographic evaluation of the appendix was originally described in 1986 in a population of adults . Since that time, the technique has been adopted in children and due to the lack of ionizing radiation has largely become the technique of choice in this population . In the 25 years since the original article, there have been numerous analyses of the performance of ultrasound in diagnosing acute appendicitis in children. Interestingly, the diagnostic criteria that are applied for acute appendicitis are largely based on the adult population and these criteria, as they apply to children, have received significantly less analytic attention over that same 25-year period. A few studies have evaluated the diagnostic value of specific sonographic findings and a recent analysis has called into question the diagnostic criteria as historically defined in the literature . This recent publication resonated with our clinical experience as we have anecdotally noted the limited value of some of the traditional diagnostic criteria. Specifically, we hypothesized that appendiceal diameter >6 mm and lack of compressibility of the appendix are poor diagnostic criteria for acute appendicitis and that secondary findings such as periappendiceal fat infiltration better predict the presence of appendicitis.

Based on our clinical experience and this hypothesis, we set out to critically review the literature and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of common sonographic criteria for acute appendicitis in children.
