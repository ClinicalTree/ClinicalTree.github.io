## Rationale and Objectives

Targeted molecular probes offer the potential for greater specificity in cancer imaging with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT). We investigate a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) nanoparticle loaded with poly-iodinated triglyceride (ITG) in a proof of concept study of targeted x-ray imaging. LDLs are targeted to the LDL cell surface receptor (LDLR), which is overexpressed in several tumor types. The LDL-LDLR pathway presents a high-capacity and self-renewing transport system for molecular imaging in CT.

## Materials and Methods

ITG was synthesized and loaded into the core of LDL particles to form a reconstituted nanoparticle, hereafter referred to as (rITG)LDL. Particle size was measured by dynamic light scattering. The x-ray attenuation of the (rITG)LDL solution was measured with CT imaging and signal enhancement was calibrated for equivalent iodine concentration. Cultured human hepatoblastoma G2 (HepG2) cells, which overexpress LDLR, were incubated with (rITG)LDL with or without native LDL. The cells were imaged with CT to characterize particle sequestration.

## Results

Reconstitution of LDL with ITG was successful and did not compromise the targeting function of the particle. Measurement of the x-ray attenuation properties of the (rITG)LDL solution revealed an effective iodine concentration of 0.78 mg/mL. In vitro studies of HepG2 cells demonstrated a significant increase in CT image intensity over control cells when incubated with (rITG)LDL.

## Conclusion

The in vitro results of this study suggest that (rITG)LDL can provide adequate image enhancement for CT molecular imaging. Potential applications include breast imaging and small animal imaging at low x-ray energies. In vivo experiments will be required to verify that tumor uptake of (rITG)LDL is sufficient for enhanced detection. Use at higher x-ray energies, as used in conventional CT, will require a further increase in iodine loading.

Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in diagnostic imaging of many types of cancer. High-quality imaging for the depiction of subtle anatomical and physiological changes associated with disease is achieved through the administration of exogenous x-ray contrast agents. These agents, typically water-soluble tri-iodinated derivatives of benzoic acid, impart imaging contrast in the body by absorbing x-rays more strongly than surrounding tissue structures, thus providing anatomical delineation of organs or tumors . The imaging contrast these agents provide is relatively short lived, typically on the order of minutes . To date, all of the approved x-ray contrast media are nonspecific extracellular agents; hence, once in the circulation, x-ray agents rapidly equilibrate with the extracellular space and subsequently undergo renal elimination.

Great efforts are being directed toward detecting cancer using targeted approaches in which conventional contrast agents are transported to malignant cells via nanoparticulate systems. Preferential accumulation of contrast media at tumor sites relative to surrounding normal tissues potentially allows lesions to be readily detected and characterized. This approach has been difficult to apply to CT imaging with the existing x-ray media because of the relatively low sensitivity of clinical CT and the commensurately high concentration of agent needed for contrast enhancement. It has been estimated that to provide a measurable signal in CT, a concentration of at least 0.5 mg/mL of iodine is required . As such, molecular imaging with an iodine-based x-ray agent would require large quantities of the contrast agent to be delivered to cancer cells. Few mechanisms exist in which such quantities of materials can be delivered and concentrated into cells. Here we describe the preliminary evaluation of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) delivery pathway as a high-capacity, self-renewing system for molecular imaging of x-ray contrast agents.
