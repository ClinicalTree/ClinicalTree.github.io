## Rationale and Objectives

To determine optimum spatial resolution when imaging peripheral arteries with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA).

## Materials and Methods

Eight vessel diameters ranging from 1.0 to 8.0 mm were simulated in a vascular phantom. A total of 40 three-dimensional flash MRA sequences were acquired with incremental variations of fields of view, matrix size, and slice thickness. The accurately known eight diameters were combined pairwise to generate 22 “exact” degrees of stenosis ranging from 42% to 87%. Then, the diameters were measured in the MRA images by three independent observers and with quantitative angiography (QA) software and used to compute the degrees of stenosis corresponding to the 22 “exact” ones. The accuracy and reproducibility of vessel diameter measurements and stenosis calculations were assessed for vessel size ranging from 6 to 8 mm (iliac artery), 4 to 5 mm (femoro-popliteal arteries), and 1 to 3 mm (infrapopliteal arteries). Maximum pixel dimension and slice thickness to obtain a mean error in stenosis evaluation of less than 10% were determined by linear regression analysis.

## Results

Mean errors on stenosis quantification were 8.8% ± 6.3% for 6- to 8-mm vessels, 15.5% ± 8.2% for 4- to 5-mm vessels, and 18.9% ± 7.5% for 1- to 3-mm vessels. Mean errors on stenosis calculation were 12.3% ± 8.2% for observers and 11.4% ± 15.1% for QA software ( _P_ = .0342). To evaluate stenosis with a mean error of less than 10%, maximum pixel surface, the pixel size in the phase direction, and the slice thickness should be less than 1.56 mm  2 , 1.34 mm, 1.70 mm, respectively (voxel size 2.65 mm  3 ) for 6- to 8-mm vessels; 1.31 mm  2 , 1.10 mm, 1.34 mm (voxel size 1.76 mm  3 ), for 4- to 5-mm vessels; and 1.17 mm  2 , 0.90 mm, 0.9 mm (voxel size 1.05 mm  3 ) for 1- to 3-mm vessels.

## Conclusion

Higher spatial resolution than currently used should be selected for imaging peripheral vessels.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has gained widespread clinical acceptance for imaging the aorta and its major branches ( ). Technical advances in contrast-enhanced bolus chase three-dimensional (3D)-MRA with fast-gradient echo-recalled sequences, moving table, and time-resolved imaging have improved diagnostic accuracy ( ).

However, suboptimal correlations with Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) have often been reported because of limited spatial resolution and frequent venous contamination observed with the sequence used for bolus-chasing MRA ( ). For infrapopliteal vessels, better results have been obtained when the examination was performed in two steps: a first injection combined with high-resolution acquisition on the distal leg and foot followed by a second injection to image proximal vessels ( ). However, this approach requires two consecutive injections and acquisitions to image the entire runoff.
