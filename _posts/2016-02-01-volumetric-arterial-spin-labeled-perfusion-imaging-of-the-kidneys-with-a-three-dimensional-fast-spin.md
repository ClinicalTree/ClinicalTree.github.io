## Rationale and Objectives

Renal perfusion measurements using noninvasive arterial spin-labeled (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging techniques are gaining interest. Currently, focus has been on perfusion in the context of renal transplant. Our objectives were to explore the use of ASL in patients with renal cancer, and to evaluate three-dimensional (3D) fast spin echo (FSE) acquisition, a robust volumetric imaging method for abdominal applications. We evaluate 3D ASL perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in the kidneys compared to two-dimensional (2D) ASL in patients and healthy subjects.

## Materials and Methods

Isotropic resolution (2.6 × 2.6 × 2.8 mm  3 ) 3D ASL using segmented FSE was compared to 2D single-shot FSE. ASL used pseudo-continuous labeling, suppression of background signal, and synchronized breathing. Quantitative perfusion values and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were compared between 3D and 2D ASL in four healthy volunteers and semiquantitative assessments were made by four radiologists in four patients with known renal masses (primary renal cell carcinoma).

## Results

Renal cortex perfusion in healthy subjects was 284 ± 21 mL/100 g/min, with test-retest repeatability of 8.8%. No significant differences were found between the quantitative perfusion value and SNR in volunteers between 3D ASL and 2D ASL, or in 3D ASL with synchronized or free breathing. In patients, semiquantitative assessment by radiologists showed no significant difference in image quality between 2D ASL and 3D ASL. In one case, 2D ASL missed a high perfusion focus in a mass that was seen by 3D ASL.

## Conclusions

3D ASL renal perfusion imaging provides isotropic-resolution images, with comparable quantitative perfusion values and image SNR in similar imaging time to single-slice 2D ASL.

## Introduction

Imaging the distribution and heterogeneity of tissue perfusion is an important component of clinical identification and characterization of primary and metastatic cancer. Quantitative perfusion measurements in tumors may be important for monitoring disease progression , in particular in response to antiangiogenic therapy , and may play a role in assessing the early changes of disease or in understanding normal physiology. There is increasing interest in perfusion measurements as a biomarker for assessing renal function and for characterizing renal masses. Quantitative perfusion is reduced in renal insufficiency and in hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis . In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), perfusion has proven value because of the relationship between angiogenesis, prognosis, and response to different targeted therapies in these tumors .

Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a well-established method for measuring tissue perfusion that has been widely used in quantitative perfusion measurements of the brain with application to brain tumors , cerebrovascular disease and stroke, epilepsy, and dementia . A major advantage of ASL is the relative ease with which ASL images can be converted to quantitative images of tissue perfusion. ASL employs external magnetic fields to label nuclear magnetization of endogenous water in arterial blood and then observes the effect on tissue signal after the water flows into and diffuses throughout the tissue. Freely diffusible endogenous water is an excellent tracer for perfusion that compares well to intravenously administered contrast material, because of its lower risk for renal patients and because signal is linear in concentration and independent of venous bolus dynamics and vessel permeability effects that complicate quantification of perfusion with intravenous contrast agents.
