## Rationale and Objectives

Our goal was to develop and evaluate software to support a computer assisted mammography feedback program (CAMFP) to be used for continuing medical education (CME).

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-five radiologists from our region signed consent to participate in an institutional review board–approved film-reading study. The radiologists primarily assessed digitized mammograms and received feedback in five film interpretation sessions. A bivariate analysis was used to evaluate the joint effects of the training on sensitivity and specificity, and the effects of image quality on reading performance were explored.

## Results

Interpretation was influenced by the CAMFP intervention: Sensitivity increased (Δ sensitivity = 0.086, _P_ < .001) and specificity decreased (Δ specificity = −0.057, _P_ = .04). Variability in interpretation among radiologists also decreased after the training sessions ( _P_ = .035).

## Conclusion

The CAMFP intervention improved sensitivity and decreased variability among radiologist’s interpretations. Although this improvement was partially offset by decreased specificity, the program is potentially useful as a component of continuing medical education of radiologists. Dissemination via the web may be possible using digital mammography.

Mammography is used widely in developed countries to detect breast cancer early enough to treat successfully. Screening accuracy could be enhanced by either improving image quality or by improving the accuracy of radiologists who interpret mammograms ( ). Differences in radiologists’ training, experience and reading volume may affect their clinical recommendations and interpretations ( ). Regulations set forth by the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) ( ) require continuing medical education (CME) for all radiologists who interpret mammograms ( ). Few studies have evaluated the specific effectiveness of CME on improving physician performance in reading mammography since the implementation of MQSA; however, results suggest modest advances in performance among 23 practicing radiologists who attended a 1-day lecture on Breast Imaging and Reporting System BI-RADS assessment ( ). In general, CME has proven to enhance overall physician performance in many fields of medicine, with the greatest benefit achieved from learning sessions that allow hands-on practice in contextually relevant or difficult areas ( ). This type of learning format is more beneficial than traditional lecture-based programs because it allows the physicians to be interactive and engaged during CME ( ).

The FDA does not specify the format in which CME units are obtained and allows radiologists to complete Web-based or computer-based programs ( ). Therefore, missed cancers and variations in mammography interpretation may be reduced by providing practice in reading difficult films with feedback on physician accuracy during CME using the computer-assisted mammography feedback program (CAMFP). CAMFP was initially designed to be used as a continuous teaching tool for radiologists in low-volume isolated practice areas. However, because it is a computer-based format that can be easily obtained over the Internet ( ), it could contribute to CME programs that are used by radiologists with varying experience levels.
