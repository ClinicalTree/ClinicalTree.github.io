## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the gallbladder patterns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) associated with acute pancreatitis (AP).

## Materials and Methods

There were 197 patients with AP, all of whom had undergone abdominal MRI. AP was categorized as either edematous or necrotizing according to its findings on MRI and graded as mild (0–3 points), moderate (4–6 points), or severe (7–10 points) according to the magnetic resonance severity index. The changes to the walls and dimensions of the gallbladder and common bile duct, in addition to the presence of biliary stones and pericholecystic fluid, were noted and compared with the severity of AP on the basis of the magnetic resonance severity index.

## Results

Of the 197 patients with AP, 81% were classified as edematous and 19% as necrotizing on MRI. There were 35%, 59%, and 6% of patients with mild, moderate, and severe AP according to the magnetic resonance severity index, respectively. Seventy-six percent of patients had at least one gallbladder abnormality on MRI, including a thickened gallbladder wall (42%), pericholecystic fluid (38%), gallbladder stones (35%), an enlarged gallbladder (24%), dilatation of the common bile duct (16%), and subserosal edema (15%). Eighty-nine percent of patients (34 of 38) with necrotizing AP had gallbladder abnormalities, which was significantly higher than the 72% of patients (115 of 159) with edematous AP ( _P_ < .05). The prevalence of gallbladder abnormalities was 64% in patients with mild AP, 81% in those with moderate AP, and 91% in those with severe AP ( _P_ < .05 among the three groups).

## Conclusions

Most patients with AP have gallbladder abnormalities on MRI, including a thickened gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid. The prevalence of gallbladder abnormalities has a positive correlation with the severity of AP on MRI.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a common cause of acute abdominal presentation in the clinic. Its median mortality is 10%, but it may reach 20% to 30% in necrotizing pancreatitis with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . AP inflammation often spreads, and the surrounding organ tissues are often involved. The gallbladder is affected by a variety of pathologic conditions that are often associated with nonspecific conditions . Because the pancreas and gallbladder are connected anatomically and functionally, pancreatic diseases are closely related to gallbladder disorders .

Understanding gallbladder patterns on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help with the diagnosis and management of AP. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become the gold standard to avoid the recurrence of gallstone pancreatitis with gallstone disease , while percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder cholangio-drainage is a useful method for severe acute obstructive gallstone pancreatitis .
