## Rationale and Objectives

A feasibility study on measuring kidney perfusion by a contrast-free magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technique is presented.

## Materials and methods

A flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) prepared true fast imaging with steady-state precession (TrueFISP) arterial spin labeling sequence was used on a 3.0-T MR-scanner. The basis for quantification is a two-compartment exchange model proposed by Parkes that corrects for diverse assumptions in single-compartment standard models.

## Results

Eleven healthy volunteers (mean age, 42.3 years; range 24–55) were examined. The calculated mean renal blood flow values for the exchange model (109 ± 5 \[medulla\] and 245 ± 11 \[cortex\] ml/min − 100 g) are in good agreement with the literature. Most important, the two-compartment exchange model exhibits a stabilizing effect on the evaluation of perfusion values if the finite permeability of the vessel wall and the venous outflow (fast solution) are considered: the values for the one-compartment standard model were 93 ± 18 (medulla) and 208 ± 37 (cortex) ml/min − 100 g.

## Conclusion

This improvement will increase the accuracy of contrast-free imaging of kidney perfusion in treatment renovascular disease.

Kidney perfusion represents a complex systemic and autoregulative circulation system. Systemic and local vasoregulation counteract the pressure gradient to maintain renal cortical perfusion within an optimal range for glomerular filtration ( ). The blood vessels of the glomeruli in the renal cortex have an autoregulative function to maintain the filtration pressure in case of high or low systemic blood pressure. Additionally, the renin-anigotensin-aldosterone system is triggered when the pressure in the macula densa falls (  Fig 1 ). Diagnosis is usually based on clinical problems in combination with sonographic imaging, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or even more invasively with angiography ( ). These methods are limited to reveal morphologic, hemodynamic, or pressure gradient details of the renal artery, or are invasive or require radiation and potentially nephrotoxic contrast media exposure ( ). Therefore, noninvasive, contrast-free functional imaging is required to study the therapeutic effects on renal tissue perfusion.

Figure 1


Effect of renal artery stenosis on systemic blood pressure and renal autoregulation. A decrease in renal arterial pressure results in a dilation of the afferent arteriol of the glomeruli, whereas the efferent arteriol exerts a constriction. Subsequently, inflow increases and outflow decreases, resulting in an augmented filtration pressure and ultrafiltraion rate is equalized. Furthermore, low inflow pressure triggers the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Systemic effects are vasoconstriction and volume extension through salt and water retention in order to elevate systemic blood pressure.

![Figure 2, The evaluation of ASL data is usually based on single-compartment approaches ( a ). In the present study, a two-compartment exchange model with an extravascular (E) and a blood compartment (B) was used ( b ). This model considers the finite permeability of the vessel wall, and therefore, the fact that the exchange of blood with the extravascular space is not instantaneous.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AFeasibilityStudyonModelbasedEvaluationofKidneyPerfusionMeasuredbyMeansofFAIRPreparedTrueFISPArterialSpinLabelingASLona3TMRScanner/0_1s20S107663320800295X.jpg)
