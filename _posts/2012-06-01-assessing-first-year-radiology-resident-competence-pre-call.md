## Rationale and Objectives

Whether first-year radiology residents are ready to start call after 6 or 12 months has been a subject of much debate. The purpose of this study was to establish an assessment that would evaluate the call readiness of first-year radiology residents and identify any individual areas of weakness using a comprehensive computerized format. Secondarily, we evaluated for any significant differences in performance before and after the change in precall training requirement from 6 to 12 months.

## Materials and Methods

A list of >140 potential emergency radiology cases was given to first-year radiology residents at the beginning of the academic year. Over 4 years, three separate versions of a computerized examination were constructed using hyperlinked PowerPoint presentations and given to both first-year and second-year residents. No resident took the same version of the exam twice. Exam score and number of cases failed were assessed. Individual areas of weakness were identified and remediated with the residents. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate exam score and the number of cases failed, considering resident year and the three versions of the exam.

## Results

Over 4 years, 17 of 19 (89%) first-year radiology residents passed the exam on first attempt. The two who failed were remediated and passed a different version of the exam 6 weeks later. Using the oral board scoring system, first-year radiology residents scored an average of 70.7 with 13 cases failed, compared to 71.1 with eight cases failed for second-year residents who scored statistically significantly higher. No significant difference was found in first-year radiology resident scoring before and after the 12-month training requirement prior to call.

## Conclusions

An emergency radiology examination was established to aid in the assessment of first-year radiology residents’ competency prior to starting call, which has become a permanent part of the first-year curriculum. Over 4 years, all first-year residents were ultimately judged ready to start call. Of the variables assessed, only resident year showed a significant difference in scoring parameters. In particular, length of training prior to taking call showed no significant difference. Areas of weakness were identified for further study.

How does a residency program decide if a resident is ready to start call? Currently, there is no uniform process across the country to assess radiology residents’ preparedness prior to taking call. A minority of programs give oral exams, but most rely on evaluations from clinical rotations. These are limited and subjective at best and in particular may not evaluate a first-year resident’s knowledge regarding the common types of exams that may be seen on call or the ability to handle a large number of studies in a short time period. Feedback from time spent on “buddy call” with a senior resident is helpful but again is influenced by the case mix and the support provided by the senior resident. If there are concerns regarding a specific resident’s competence for solo call, formal documentation of his or her abilities is key, particularly if delay of call commencement is considered. Identifying individual residents’ areas of weaknesses is even more difficult but is crucial for guiding remediation and sometimes curricular changes.

In 2006, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, had no specific criteria in place to assess readiness for call. We therefore developed a series of computerized emergency radiology examinations to evaluate the competency of our first-year residents prior to call and to assess for any areas of particular weakness that would require more study. We felt that the exam should not be in a multiple-choice format but in a “picture archiving and communication system (PACS)–like” format that would more closely mimic a night of call. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements for residents to complete 12 months of training before solo call that came into force in 2008 also provided us with the opportunity to compare the performances of residents who had had 6 months of training prior to call with that of residents who had had 12 months. We report our 4-year experience in developing and administering this examination annually.
