## Rationale and Objectives

First study to investigate the basic tissue elastic properties of the cervix in pre- and postmenopausal healthy women and to compare these normal findings with the results in a group of patients with focal pathology of the cervix.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 113 patients underwent transvaginal ultrasound, among them 24 with cervical pathology. The real-time elastography (Hitachi) information was color-coded and superimposed on the B-mode scan. The elastography images were analyzed by means of a software tool to identify thresholds for the colors red (soft), blue (hard), and green (medium hard), and the percentages of the three colors of the total area were determined. The results were correlated with age. In addition, scans were evaluated subjectively on an analogue scale from 1 (definitely normal) to 5 (definitely abnormal). Statistical analysis was performed using Anova, Wilcoxon’s test, and Pearson’s correlation.

## Results

Computer-assisted generation of the color spectrum showed green to be predominant in both the normal group (67±13 %) and in the group with cervical pathology (64±15 %) without a significant difference between both groups (p=>0.05). Significant differences (p<0.05) in the blue color spectrum (hard tissue) were found between the 13 cervical tumor patients (34±15 %) and the normal group (26±13 %) but not between the CIN patients and normal women (19±12 %) (p>0.05). Subjective tumor characterization also showed significant differences (p<0.05) among the groups and good correlation with the histologic diagnosis (r2=0.744). There were no significant changes in color distribution with patient age (p>0.05).

## Conclusion

Computer-assisted and subjective evaluation of cervical elastography allows differentiation of malignancy from normal findings. CIN cannot be identified with this modality. Elastographically, cervical tissue is of medium hardness and does not change with age.

A biological tissue possesses a specific inherent elasticity that may be altered by pathophysiological processes such as maturation, inflammation, or malignancy. The elasticity of a tissue is defined as the tension (pressure) required to produce relative elongation (stretching) and is a measure of the pressure necessary to achieve elastic ( ). In recent years, many study groups have focused on the development of imaging techniques to visualize such changes in tissue elasticity by determining the shearing modulus ( ). These groups study not only approaches based on magnetic resonance imaging but also state-of-the-art techniques of sonoelastography, which have already been investigated experimentally in different tissues as well as in patients ( ). The most recently introduced ultrasound (US) technique for the evaluation of tissue elasticity is real-time sonoelastography ( ). Using this technique, elasticity information is provided in real time and displayed in color on the B-mode scans similar to color Doppler information. Initial results achieved with real-time sonoelastography in different organs such as the breast and prostate are promising ( ). Tissue compressibility is used as a parameter in the differential diagnosis of breast lesions by ultrasonography, and a tumor that cannot be compressed has a 31% higher risk of malignancy ( ). Initial studies suggest that real-time elastography can be successfully used to assess breast tumors ( ). Because it is possible in principle to derive tissue elasticities from stretching values (which are calculated directly from high-frequency echo signals), the data needed can be obtained with endoprobes. Therefore, studying this new technique for evaluating the cervix, which is rigid when a tumor is present, is an interesting approach. The normal cervix consists mostly of collagen with a small proportion of muscle fibers. During pregnancy, for example, the collagen fibers are initially stabilized by decortin (PGS2) and dissolved by biglycan (PGS1) during the third trimester ( ). Therefore, the elastic properties of the cervix are affected not only by age but also by physiological factors. The standard screening and diagnostic tests for cervical cancer are cytologic smears and bimanual palpation, and transvaginal US has only a supplementary role ( ).

Based on these considerations, we performed a study to investigate whether real-time sonoelastography is able to visualize the normal elastic properties of the cervix in relation to patient age and to differentiate tumorous changes of the cervix in patients with cervical cancer or suspicious cytology findings from the normal appearance. To our knowledge, these questions have not been addressed in a clinical study previously (based on a PubMed search for the period from January 1996 to July 2006). More specifically, the questions to be answered in this first original article are whether cervical elasticity shows typical premenopausal and postmenopausal variations with age and whether these properties can serve to define a normal population. Besides defining the color (elastic) composition of the normal cervix, we examined selected cervical lesions by using real-time sonoelastography.
