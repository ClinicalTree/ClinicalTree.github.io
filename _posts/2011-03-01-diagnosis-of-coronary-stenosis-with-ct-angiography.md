## Rationale and Objectives

To compare computer-generated interpretation of coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) by commercially available COR Analyzer software with expert human interpretation.

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act‑compliant study was approved by the institutional review board. Among 225 consecutive cCTA examinations, 207 were of adequate quality for automated evaluation. COR Analyzer interpretation was compared to human expert interpretation for detection of stenosis defined as ≥50% vessel diameter reduction in the left main, left anterior descending (LAD), circumflex (LCX), right coronary artery (RCA), or a branch vessel (diagonal, ramus, obtuse marginal, or posterior descending artery).

## Results

Among 207 cases evaluated by COR Analyzer, human expert interpretation identified 48 patients with stenosis. COR Analyzer identified 44/48 patients (sensitivity 92%) with a specificity of 70%, a negative predictive value of 97% and a positive predictive value of 48%. COR Analyzer agreed with the expert interpretation in 75% of patients. With respect to individual segments, COR Analyzer detected 9/10 left main lesions, 33/34 LAD lesions, 14/15 LCX lesions, 27/31 RCA lesions, and 8/11 branch lesions. False-positive interpretations were localized to the left main (n = 16), LAD (n = 26), LCX (n = 21), RCA (n = 21), and branch vessels (n = 23), and were related predominantly to calcified vessels, blurred vessels, misidentification of vessels and myocardial bridges.

## Conclusions

Automated computer interpretation of cCTA with COR Analyzer provides high negative predictive value for the diagnosis of coronary disease in major coronary arteries as well as first-order arterial branches. False-positive automated interpretations are related to anatomic and image quality considerations.

Although catheter angiography is the accepted “gold standard” for the diagnosis of coronary disease, a negative coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) study is sufficient to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease because of the high sensitivity and negative predictive value of cCTA . Several recent studies suggest that cCTA is a cost-effective examination for evaluation of low- to intermediate-risk patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting to the emergency department . The diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of interpretation for cCTA, however, is directly related to the experience of the interpreting physician . A major limitation of cCTA for evaluation of emergency room chest pain patients is the lack of available experienced readers, especially during night time and weekend hours.

The fundamental task required for the interpretation of coronary angiography is identification and quantification of stenosis within the coronary circulation. This task is facilitated by computer-aided vessel tracking and image reconstruction techniques available on CT workstations that improve visualization of the vascular lumen and assist the interpreting physician to quantify the degree of stenosis. The presence and degree of stenosis must be evaluated in the major coronary arteries—including the left main (LM) artery, left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex (LCX) artery, right coronary artery (RCA), posterior descending artery (PDA)—as well as the diagonal branches of the LAD (D1 and D2) and obtuse marginal branches of the LCX (OM1 and OM2). Because this task is well defined and quantitative, and because computer-aided techniques are currently used to facilitate human observers, it seems reasonable that this task may be amenable to automated computer diagnosis.
