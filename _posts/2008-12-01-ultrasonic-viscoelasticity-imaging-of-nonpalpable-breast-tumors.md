## Rationale and Objectives

Improvements in the diagnosis of early breast cancers depend on a physician's ability to obtain the information necessary to distinguish nonpalpable malignant and benign tumors.Viscoelastic features that describe mechanical properties of tissues may help to distinguish these types of lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-one patients with nonpalpable, pathology-confirmed Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 4 or 5 breast lesions (10 benign, 11 malignant) detected by mammography were studied. Viscoelastic parameters were extracted from a time sequence of ultrasonic strain images, and differences in the parameters between malignant and benign tumors were compared. Parametric data were color coded and superimposed on sonograms.

## Results

The strain retardance time parameter, _T_ 1 , provided the best discrimination between malignant and benign tumors ( _P_ < .01). _T_ 1 measures the time required for tissues to fully deform (strain) once compressed; therefore, it describes the time-varying viscous response of tissue to a small deforming force. Compared to the surrounding background tissues, malignant lesions have smaller average _T_ 1 values, whereas benign lesions have higher _T_ 1 values. This tissue-specific contrast correlates with known changes in the extracellular matrix of breast stroma.

## Conclusion

Characterization of nonpalpable breast lesions is improved by the addition of viscoelastic strain imaging parameters. The differentiation of malignant and benign BI-RADS 4 or 5 tumors is especially evident with the use of the retardation time estimates, _T_ 1 .

Breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death worldwide, and the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women ( ). In the United States during 2007, it was expected that approximately 178,480 women would develop invasive breast cancer and an estimated 40,910 patients would die from this disease. The combined efforts of early detection and improved treatment have steadily decreased the death rate in women from breast cancer since 1990. The earliest cancer signs are detectable by medical imaging often before symptoms appear. Diagnosis is currently based on information obtained from the clinical examination, anatomic imaging, and biopsy. Although histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosis, the biopsy procedure is invasive, expensive, and carries some risk. Therefore, additional noninvasive diagnostic imaging methods to increase specificity and reduce the need for biopsy would be beneficial.

Recent discoveries in molecular biology have triggered interest in developing new and potentially more specific imaging methods for breast cancer diagnosis ( ). These include techniques for: 1) direct imaging of signaling molecules and/or receptors mediating malignant progression, and 2) indirect imaging of intrinsic tissue properties (eg, biochemical, mechanical) that describe the tumor microenvironment controlling signaling pathways. We use the latter method to detect local changes in soft tissue. The alteration in elasticity properties is in part a result of inflammation that usually occurs during the early stages of disease development. The extracellular matrix (ECM) of breast stroma, which provides the solid consistency of parenchymal tissues, plays an active role in cancerous tumor growth ( ). Hence, breast stroma is a potentially valuable source of endogenous disease-specific contrast.

Compression is applied from time t = 0 until t 0 , during which the instantaneous elastic strain is measured. t 0 is also the time at which computation of the viscoelastic response begins. The viscoelastic curve lasts 12 to 15 seconds.
