Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved as a powerful tool for the assessment of the small bowel. Strengths of MRI include the superb soft-tissue contrast, lack of radiation exposure, and the implementation of fast scanning techniques. Clinically relevant findings such as inflammation and tumor disease can be well-depicted. We describe in this article current techniques of small bowel MRI including its implementation and clinical outcome in comparison to other radiological and endoscopic procedures.

Because of considerable improvements in cross-sectional imaging, there is general consensus today to shift from fluoroscopic examinations to computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for small bowel imaging . Cross-sectional imaging allows for an assessment not only of the entire bowel wall, but also depicts changes in the perienteric fat. CT has become an attractive tool for small bowel imaging due to its high availability, relatively low cost, robustness, and short examination times . Furthermore, the administration of negative or neutral oral contrast agents results in an easy delineation of pathological structures of the bowel wall. However, similar to fluoroscopic procedures, CT is associated with radiation exposure of the patients. This may be of particular concern for young patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease who have to undergo diagnostic procedures multiple times during the course of disease.

As a result, MR imaging has become increasingly important as a method for the evaluation of various small bowel disorders . It combines the advantages of excellent soft-tissue contrast, noninvasiveness, and lack of ionizing radiation. Furthermore, recent developments of MR imaging are associated with improved spatial and temporal resolution as well as decreased motion artifacts. In this article we describe technical aspects of small bowel MR imaging, discuss clinical indications for this technique, and compare the outcome of small bowel MR imaging with other imaging modalities.

## MR enteroclysis or MR enterography?

Sufficient bowel distension is a prerequisite for small bowel imaging. Nondistended bowel loops may lead to false-positive and/or false-negative findings . Collapsed intestinal segments may falsely mimic inflammatory or tumorous changes of the bowel wall and may also conceal real existing pathologies. Two different techniques to provide sufficient luminal distension of the small bowel have been proposed: MR enteroclysis and MR enterography.

MR enteroclysis is performed in analogy to conventional enteroclysis: a methylcellulose and water solution is administered through a fluoroscopically placed nasojejunal tube . Image sets are acquired after rapid filling of the entire small bowel. This technique is associated with excellent image quality because of superb bowel distension (  Fig 1 ). Changes in the bowel wall can be easily depicted (  Fig 2 ). However, the procedure may be perceived as traumatizing by the patients because of duodenal intubation, which taints the noninvasive character of MR imaging. Furthermore, the duodenal intubation is performed under fluoroscopic guidance, which is associated with radiation exposure to the patient. Finally, the preparation of MR enteroclysis is to some degree cumbersome because the patient must be transferred from the fluoroscopy suite to the MR suite with the nasojejunal tube in place. Therefore, some centers have discontinued MR enteroclysis and preferentially perform MR enterography.
