## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare four different fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences with different techniques with regard to image quality and lesion detection in upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-two consecutive patients referred for upper abdominal MRI for the evaluation of various suspected pathologies were included in this study. Different T2-weighted sequences (free-breathing navigator-triggered turbo spin-echo \[TSE\], free-breathing navigator-triggered TSE with restore pulse (RP), breath-hold TSE with RP, and free-breathing navigator-triggered TSE with RP using the periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction technique \[using BLADE, a Siemens implementation of this technique\]) were used on all patients. All images were assessed independently by two radiologists. Assessments of motion artifacts; the edge sharpness of the liver, pancreas, and intrahepatic vessels; depictions of the intrahepatic vessels; and overall image quality were performed qualitatively. Quantitative analysis was performed by calculation of the signal-to-noise ratios for liver tissue and gallbladder as well as contrast-to-noise ratios of liver to spleen.

## Results

Liver and gallbladder signal-to-noise ratios as well as liver to spleen contrast-to-noise ratios were significantly higher ( _P_ < .05) for the BLADE technique compared to all other sequences. In qualitative analysis, the severity of motion artifacts was significantly lower with T2-weighted free-breathing navigator-triggered BLADE sequences compared to other sequences ( _P_ < .01). The edge sharpness of the liver, pancreas, and intrahepatic vessels; depictions of the intrahepatic vessels; and overall image quality were significantly better with the BLADE sequence ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

The T2-weighted free-breathing navigator-triggered TSE sequence with the BLADE technique is a promising approach for reducing motion artifacts and improving image quality in upper abdominal MRI scans.

For liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-quality T2-weighted (T2W) images are necessary for the detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions. Various MRI techniques have been investigated to achieve optimal image quality . Recent technical developments such as powerful gradient systems and receiver coils with higher sensitivities have significantly enhanced image quality. However, motion artifacts remain a central problem of upper abdominal MRI scans, being the main cause of image quality degradation, and great efforts have been made to achieve high-quality T2W images without motion artifacts. Today, T2W turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences are generally considered to be the standard imaging sequence for the evaluation of liver parenchyma. Breath-hold (BH) imaging with rapid imaging techniques has been a useful method that can reduce respiratory motion artifacts, providing shorter acquisition times and thereby increasing patient compliance and throughput. TSE and half-Fourier acquisition single-shot TSE are widely used methods of BH T2W imaging that permit scanning of the entire liver in a single or a few BH steps .

Another approach for reducing respiratory motion artifacts is to use triggering techniques that synchronize anatomic data acquisition with the respiratory cycle using a belt placed on the patient's abdomen . Respiratory triggering techniques provide high tissue contrast and allow images to be obtained at thin slice thicknesses.
