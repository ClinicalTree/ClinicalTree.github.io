## Rationale and Objectives

Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is an emerging functional modality, which can reflect tumor metabolic activity and angiogenesis. The purpose of this exploratory study was to correlate the total hemoglobin concentration (THC) measured by noninvasive DOT with prognostic factors in breast carcinomas.

## Materials and Methods

We prospectively imaged 251 breast carcinomas in 229 consecutive women (mean age, 51.18 ± 12.32 years) using DOT from 2007 to 2010. Tumor angiogenesis and metabolic activity were assessed based on quantitatively measured THC. The THC was correlated with prognostic factors, including tumor size, histopathologic classification, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), c-erbB-2, and p53.

## Results

In univariate analysis, THC was significantly correlated with the following prognostic factors: tumor size ( _P_ < .001), histologic grade ( _P_ < .001), ER ( _P_ < .05), PR ( _P_ < .001), and c-erbB-2 ( _P_ < .05). THC was not associated with histopathologic classification ( _P_ = .170) or p53 ( _P_ = .463). On the basis of a stepwise multiple regression analysis, THC of invasive ductal carcinoma was significantly correlated with tumor size ( _P_ < .001), histologic grade ( _P_ < .001), and PR ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

THC was associated with prognostic factors of breast carcinoma. THC may be considered as a new prognostic parameter of breast carcinoma and a prediction of tumor behavior and biological activity.

Ultrasound has been widely used as a screening and diagnostic modality to assess the morphologic characteristics of breast tumors. However, they do not provide information on physiological changes in lesions. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is an emerging functional modality, which is used for scanning multiwavelength diffuse scattering photons to acquire information on physiology, biochemistry, and molecular function of breast tumors and give three-dimensional maps of absorption. DOT can measure the total hemoglobin concentration (THC) of breast lesions to quantitatively reflect tumor metabolic activity and angiogenesis, which are associated with prognosis in breast carcinoma. Some researchers have used THC to differentiate breast carcinomas from benign lesions and to monitor tumor changes during neoadjuvant chemotherapy . However, to our knowledge, there are few studies that have addressed the associations between THC and histopathologic prognostic factors of breast carcinoma . The purpose of our study was to investigate the correlation between THC and prognostic factors of breast carcinoma and the potential role of THC in predicting biological behavior preoperatively.

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

The authors prospectively evaluated 546 lesions using ultrasound-guided DOT in 489 consecutive women who underwent open biopsy in our hospital between October 2007 and February 2010. The lesions were all identified using ultrasound at the time of the study. A total of 254 patients with 276 lesions were pathologically diagnosed with breast carcinomas. Eleven patients were excluded because their breast tissue was too thin to image (<1 cm), and 14 carcinomas were excluded because they had a large diameter (>5 cm), which caused poor probe-tissue contact and resulted in image artifacts. Thus, a total of 229 consecutive women (mean age, 51.18 ± 12.32 years; range, 19–82 years) with 251 breast carcinomas were included in the final study. The institutional review board approved this study, and all patients signed informed consent forms.
