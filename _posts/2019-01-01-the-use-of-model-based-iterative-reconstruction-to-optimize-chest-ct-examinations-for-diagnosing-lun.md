## Rationale and Objectives

This phantom study aimed to evaluate low-dose (LD) chest computed tomography (CT) protocols using model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) for diagnosing lung metastases in patients with sarcoma.

## Materials and Methods

An adult female anthropomorphic phantom was scanned with a 64-slice CT using four LD protocols and a standard-dose protocol. Absorbed organ doses were measured with 10 metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor dosimeters. Furthermore, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to estimate organ and effective doses. Image quality in terms of image noise, contrast, and resolution was measured from the CT images reconstructed with conventional filtered back projection, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and MBIR algorithms. All the results were compared to the performance of the standard-dose protocol.

## Results

Mean absorbed organ and effective doses were reduced by approximately 95% with the LD protocol (100-kVp tube voltage and a fixed 10-mA tube current) compared to the standard-dose protocol (120-kVp tube voltage and tube current modulation) while yielding an acceptable image quality for diagnosing round-shaped lung metastases. The effective doses ranged from 0.16 to 2.83 mSv in the studied protocols. The image noise, contrast, and resolution were maintained or improved when comparing the image quality of LD protocols using MBIR to the performance of the standard-dose chest CT protocol using filtered back projection. The small round-shaped lung metastases were delineated at levels comparable to the used protocols.

## Conclusions

Radiation exposure in patients can be reduced significantly by using LD chest CT protocols and MBIR algorithm while maintaining image quality for detecting round-shaped lung metastases.

## Introduction

Soft tissue sarcoma is a cancer that originates in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, fat tissue, lymph and blood vessels, or nerves. Tumors are often located in the limbs, head and neck, chest, or abdomen; the lungs are the most common site of metastatic disease in soft tissue sarcoma . Therefore, patients at high risk of metastases are usually evaluated with chest computed tomography (CT) scans that can typically show round-shaped sarcoma metastases. Dose reduction in CT has become a major objective in optimizing radiological examinations. This finding is due to increased CT use in diagnosing diseases in the chest and other body areas and CT's significant role in the accumulated radiation dose of the population. In accordance with current knowledge, the likelihood of presenting with stochastic adverse effects (eg, cancer) is assumed to increase linearly with radiation dose .

According to the commonly accepted ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) principle, examinations using ionizing radiation should be performed with a radiation dose that is as low as reasonably achievable while maintaining sufficient image quality for diagnosis. Optimization strategies for chest CT include the use of automatic tube current modulation (TCM), lowered tube voltage, adaptive beam collimation in helical scans, and partial scanning (organ dose modulation); these strategies have all been used to reduce radiation exposure to tissues and to optimize image quality . One of the most promising CT optimization techniques is the continuously developing iterative reconstruction algorithms that aim to overcome the limitations of the traditional reconstruction method of filtered back projection (FBP) for image quality and diagnostic dose efficiency. The iterative reconstruction algorithms include statistical (hybrid) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques. The former only models the noise statistics, whereas the latter uses a more complex system of prediction models, including modeling of optical factors, such as x-ray tube and detector responses, in addition to voxel projections, x-ray beam spectra, and noise statistics . Several studies have reported significant dose reduction capabilities of iterative reconstruction methods (especially with MBIR) in the chest and other body areas while maintaining or improving diagnostic image quality . However, some researchers have warned about the possibilities of missing clinically significant lesions with low-dose (LD) abdominal and chest CT protocols using iterative reconstruction techniques . The image noise magnitude and texture of the iteratively reconstructed images depend on the scanned tissue, and noise magnitude may behave differently at tissue boundaries compared to uniform regions .

![Figure 2, (a) A schematic representation of image quality analysis. Resolution was assessed by two methods, radial averaging air (1) or soft tissue (2) plugs in the lung ( top left ) and averaging by the distance perpendicular to a tissue border (3–5, top right ). The pixel intensities are sorted by the distance from the plug center or tissue boundary, r (double-headed arrows), and the resulting oversampled edge-spread function is differentiated to produce the line spread function (b) . The full width at half maxima of the resulting line spread function is recorded as the resolution value. (c) Noise and contrast in the lung (6) are evaluated by fitting Gaussian distributions to the truncated histograms. Hounsfield unit values below −1000 in the first histogram bin are omitted because of saturation. The fitted standard deviation and expectation values are recorded as the noise and contrast measures. Not shown in the image are the actual ROIs defined for lung and soft tissues. NPSs are calculated from a square region (7) in the mediastinum and averaged over multiple slices.
