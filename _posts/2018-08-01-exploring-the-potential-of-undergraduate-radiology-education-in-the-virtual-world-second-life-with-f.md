## Rationale and Objectives

Virtual worlds have a remarkable potential for effective teaching and learning, providing immersive, realistic, and engaging online events. Previous studies have explored online education of health professionals in Second Life (SL), the most widely used virtual world, but none of the previous learning experiences were related to radiology. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of SL for undergraduate radiology education and the involvement of students in SL learning activities.

## Materials and Methods

We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program.

## Results

Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean ≥ 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean ≥ 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean ≥ 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean ≥ 9.05/10).

## Conclusion

Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly. The potential of using SL for radiology education includes promising expectations regarding collaborative learning and gamification.

## Introduction

A virtual world is a computer-based simulated environment, as well as an online community and a three-dimensional virtual space that simulates reality in which the user interacts with contents and visitors without having to physically move to a common place. In 2003, the company Linden Research Inc. created Second Life (SL), one of the most well-known and widely used virtual worlds, a virtual community developed by its own users . To join SL, the user must create an account, choose an avatar, and download the SL viewer or any other SL-compatible viewer to display the virtual world on his or her computer screen. Almost all the objects that are visible in SL are built from primitive three-dimensional geometric shapes called prims. Prims can assume any desirable shape and can look any way desired by applying selected textures to their surfaces. They can do things via internal scripts written in Linden Scripting Language, or share media, for example, displaying a web page on a face . The user interacts with the virtual world by means of his or her avatar. Interactions include viewing the world from different perspectives and focuses, touching objects, answering to displayed menus originated from Linden Scripting Language scripts, moving, adopting gestures, and communicating with others.

Virtual worlds have a remarkable potential to be used for effective teaching and learning , providing the possibility to create immersive, realistic, and engaging online events that can provide high-quality medical education to health-related users in remote locations . There are a wide range of health-related activities on SL , most of them dedicated to patient education or increased awareness about health issues, but there are also training sites that offer education by means of classrooms, discussions, lectures, simulation, and patient interaction. In fact, professional and academic education in health care contains the largest number of papers in a systematic literature review regarding the use of three-dimensional virtual worlds .
