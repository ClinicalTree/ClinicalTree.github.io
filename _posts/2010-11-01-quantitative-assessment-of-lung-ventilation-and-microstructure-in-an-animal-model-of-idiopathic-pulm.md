## Rationale and Objectives

The use of hyperpolarized  3 He magnetic resonance imaging as a quantitative lung imaging tool has progressed rapidly in the past decade, mostly in the assessment of the airway diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. This technique has shown potential to assess both structural and functional information in healthy and diseased lungs. In this study, the regional measurements of structure and function were applied to a bleomycin rat model of interstitial lung disease.

## Materials and Methods

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 300–350 g) were administered intratracheal bleomycin. After 3 weeks, apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional ventilation were measured by  3 He magnetic resonance imaging and pulmonary function testing using a rodent-specific plethysmography chamber. Sensitized and healthy animals were then compared using threshold analysis to assess the potential sensitivity of these techniques to pulmonary abnormalities.

## Results

No significant changes were observed in total lung volume and compliance between the two groups. Airway resistance elevated and forced expiratory volume significantly declined in the 3-week bleomycin rats, and fractional ventilation was significantly decreased compared to control animals ( _P_ < .0004). The apparent diffusion coefficient of  3 He showed a smaller change but still a significant decrease in 3-week bleomycin animals ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Preliminary results suggest that quantitative  3 He magnetic resonance imaging can be a sensitive and noninvasive tool to assess changes in an animal interstitial lung disease model. This technique may be useful for longitudinal animal studies and also in the investigation of human interstitial lung diseases.

Of all the pulmonary diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one of the most debilitating because is a progressive disorder for which the etiology and pathogenesis are unknown, and there is no effective therapy . IPF is a relatively rare disease, with a prevalence in men of approximately 20 in 100,000 and in woman of 13 in 100,000. In addition, the incidence of this disorder appears to have risen over the past decade. The obstacles and shortcomings to learning about effectively treating this disease must be overcome to care for the 5 million people worldwide with IPF. Because of the current lack of knowledge and understanding of this disorder, patients diagnosed with IPF face a median survival time after diagnosis of 3.2 years . To date, despite there being much interest in determining the causes of IPF and in finding effective treatments, no methods have yet come forward to solve either problem .

A major shortcoming that makes the discovery of new therapies a challenge to investigators is the inability to find a reliable early marker of progressive disease . The pathologic changes noted in IPF are not specific and are regionally heterogeneous . In addition, the changes can also be seen in other disorders, such as asbestosis. Fibrosis appears to be an active process, and it is characterized by the presence of fibrogenic foci. This is thought to cause remodeling of the lung, with the destruction of alveoli and thickening of the interstitium . These pathologic changes are also thought to result in the physiologic changes that are characterized by decrease in lung volume, an increase in lung stiffness or decreased compliance, and finally a decreased ability of the lung to transfer oxygen from the airspaces to the red blood cells. Unfortunately, the techniques used to measure changes in lung volume, compliance, and oxygen transfer are difficult, and some that are not routinely performed (compliance) have high variability (diffusion capacity) and can be affected by other processes (forced vital capacity and total lung capacity \[TLC\]). Several techniques to monitor progression have been used to record changes in forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity, and 6-minute walking distance and/or changes on chest computed tomography. Changes on chest computed tomography have not proven useful, and forced vital capacity, diffusion capacity, and 6-minute walking distance cannot measure regional changes but only global changes in function. To this end, we chose to explore IPF using a new technique, namely, hyperpolarized (HP) gas imaging technology.

This model was used to yield fractional ventilation maps by solving for the _r_ value on a pixel-by-pixel basis. _S_ 0 is the signal proportional to the source magnetization of the HP  3 He in the ventilator reservoir, and _S_ ( _j_ ) represents the signal intensity for the _j_ th breath. The oxygen-induced depolarization of  3 He during each breath is governed by D  o 2 = −τ/ _T_ 1, o 2 , where _T_ 1, o 2 = ξ/P  o 2 is the oxygen-induced depolarization time constant of HP  3 He as a function of the partial pressure of oxygen (P  o 2 ) present in the airways, with ξ ≈ 2.6 bar · s at normal body temperature . The RF depolarization effect D  RF = _N_ PE × ln(cos α) represents the accumulative effect of repeated RF excitations on HP  3 He, where α represents the RF pulse flip angle, and _N_ PE is the number of pulses triggered per image (ie, the number of phase encode lines). From a practical standpoint, the oxygen decay effect has a negligible effect on signal buildup , and therefore a nominal value of P  o 2 = 140 mbar was assumed to hold throughout the lung. On the other hand, the RF pulse effect has a substantial effect on signal dynamics and is separately calculated on regional basis by acquiring a series of five back-to-back ventilation images during a 2-second breath hold at the end of the fractional ventilation maneuver.
