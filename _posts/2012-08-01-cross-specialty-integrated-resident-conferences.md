## Rationale and Objectives

Radiologists play a pivotal role in patient management, primarily through interacting with referring clinicians. Despite this extensive cross-specialty interaction, radiology resident education rarely involves direct education from clinicians outside the department. We surveyed resident attitudes toward integrated conferences with subspecialty referring physicians both before and after a pilot lecture series at our institution.

## Materials and Methods

Three thoracic-themed multidisciplinary conferences were organized, which involved a variety of clinicians lecturing during normal resident conference times. Resident surveys were administered before and after the complete lectures series as well as immediately after each individual lecture.

## Results

The prelecture series survey indicated residents felt neutral about their confidence in knowing what clinicians want from radiology reports and the current level of “clinician-focus” in the curriculum. Residents indicated a desire for more clinician involvement in lectures. After completion of the series, residents expressed that the integrated conferences were useful and that they had greater confidence in understanding the clinicians' expectation of reports. Resident interest in clinician participation in lectures was higher after series completion. Most residents indicated that prespecified, self-identified learning objectives were met by the lectures. After the completion of the series, most residents indicated that they wanted the series to continue, with the most commonly indicated desired frequency being once or twice a month.

## Conclusion

Subspecialty clinician participation in a cross-specialty integrated resident lecture series was highly favored and well received. An “Integrated Clinical Lecture Series” may be a beneficial addition to radiology residency curriculums.

## Introduction

The interaction between referring clinicians and radiologists is critical to effective patient care because many clinical decisions stem from radiologic interpretation. Educating referring clinicians with respect to appropriate study ordering, and radiologists with respect to communication of key diagnostic information, is essential to optimizing care for the patient. The majority of the radiology-clinician interaction occurs via radiology's main product, the radiology report . With notable exceptions, including in ultrasound, breast imaging, nuclear medicine, and procedure-based subfields, radiologists' in-person and telephone interactions tend to be with clinicians more than patients.

Despite the central role played by clinicians, the mainstay of radiology resident education is lectures given by attending radiologists. Further, didactic lectures tend to focus most on imaging findings and interpretation with relatively less attention paid to the clinical implications.
