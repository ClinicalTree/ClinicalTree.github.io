## Rationale and Objectives

In this study, we compared the effect of focused ultrasound with the effect of thermal stress on the induction of a heat inducible promoter in an in vitro model using three tumor cell lines (M21, SCCVII, and NIH3T3).

## Materials and Methods

We used a reporter construct that was generated using the stress-inducible promoter from the gene encoding a murine 70-kilodalton heat shock protein (Hsp70A.1) and a luciferase ( _luc_ ) reporter plasmid. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was applied in two different modes. In the first mode, an increasing voltage at constant pulse duration and in the second mode a constant voltage at increasing pulse duration was applied. HIFU or thermal stress was delivered over a range of temperatures (36–52°C) for 5 minutes, and resulting luciferase activity was measured in live cells using a cooled charge-coupled device camera as a measure of reporter gene transcription. Luciferase activity was measured at set time intervals for a total of 108 hours post-stress.

## Results

Both methods induced the _hsp70_ promoter; however, the luciferase activity under the influence of HIFU, independent of the applied mode, and thermal stress differs despite the fact that the temperature was the same. In the M21 tumor cell line, the maximum luciferase activity after focused ultrasound application was 4818 ± 1521% at a temperature of 48°C and after thermal stress 4468.2 ± 1890.2% at a temperature of 52°C with a viability of 72.3 ± 5.2% and 85 ± 3.4%, respectively. In the SCC tumor cell line, the maximum luciferase activity after focused ultrasound application was 6743.0 ± 3281.4% and after only thermal stress exposure was 3910.6 ± 2189.0% at a temperature of 44°C and 50°C, respectively. At the highest luciferase activity, the portion of vital cells was 72.5 ± 8.4% and 72.5 ± 5.9% respectively. In the NIH3T3 tumor cell line the highest luciferase activity of 428510.6 ± 26526.8% was seen at a temperature of 42°C applying focused ultrasound. Under thermal stress it was 29221.3 ± 7205.0% at a temperature of 50°C. At the highest luciferase activity, the viability analysis showed 75.3 ± 9.2% and 72.3 ± 7.9% viable cells, respectively.

## Conclusions

Focused ultrasound induces _hsp70_ expression like thermal stress alone; however, HIFU is capable of inducing expression at lower temperatures than heat stress alone, indicating that nonthermal effects also play a role on the induction of _hsp70_ .

High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been used clinically for thermal ablation of tumors ( ) and has promising potential as a therapeutic modality and for drug and gene delivery. So far, ultrasound has been used to permeabilize cell membranes for protein transport ( ), to enhance reporter gene expression in benign and malignant cell types both in culture and in vivo ( ), and to induce apoptosis in cell culture ( ) as well as in vivo in rabbit brain ( ) and human breast cancer ( ). HIFU causes physical changes in tissues both through physical alteration, primarily thought to be indirectly caused by either the sonochemical or sonomechanical effects of acoustic cavitation on the cells ( ), and through energy deposition leading to localized heating.

The ability of ultrasound to induce localized heating could be exploited by using HIFU in conjunction with a heat inducible promoter. It has been demonstrated that the promoter for the heat-shock protein (HSP) can activate gene expression in response to hyperthermia ( ). HSP are highly conserved and found in nearly all subcellular compartments ( ), where they perform a variety of chaperoning functions, including antigen presentation ( ) and folding/unfolding processes of nascent polypeptides and proteins ( ). These functions of the HSPs may be important in the expression of thermotolerance ( ). HSPs are not only induced by stress, but they are also associated with physiologic processes such as the cell cycle, cell proliferation, and differentiation ( ). The induced synthesis of HSPs is, at the molecular level, the cellular response to a wide range of threatening stimuli such as heat shock, heavy metals, oxidative stress, fever, inflammation, ethanol, amino acid analogs, anoxia, and agents capable of perturbing protein structure ( ).
