Mosby’s Nuclear Medicine, 2nd edition, by Henkin and co-authors is an excellent, very clinically relevant and topical two-volume set of books that includes more than 1800 pages that are styled in a manner befitting a textbook or reference tome. It serves very nicely in both of these roles, mercifully split into two volumes (with the first slightly larger than the second). The size and weight of the combination would typically obviate transporting the books around, but having them separated in this fashion makes it much more feasible. Thus, it could occupy a place of prominence and relevance on your bookshelf, but also be carried into the reading room or in your bag.

In terms of content, the book is very impressive, having recruited essentially an army of authors for the mercifully “focused” chapters. The individual chapters are very readable with appropriate scope, despite the large size of the overall books. Thus, it could really serve as a primary text (like a textbook). The chapters are logically organized. The images are very impressive, with liberal use of color illustrations and medical images; this is particularly appropriate with the subject of nuclear medicine. The topics cover not only the basics but “cutting-edge” methodologies and applications as well. I did not read the first edition, but in the foreword and preface, there is mention of how much nuclear medicine has changed in the last 10 years (since the prior version) and how much the book needed to be (and was) changed. It certainly feels up-to-date; who knows how long that will last in today’s age of brisk rate of change in our specialties? There are some unexpected (at least to me) finds in here as well, including the timeline of nuclear medicine, such as milestones in its history; I am especially grateful to anyone in radiology or its allied fields who does work like this. As well, there is very good coverage of radiopharmaceuticals, techniques, and technical considerations, all of which are timely and clinically relevant.

In terms of potential improvements that I could suggest, artifacts are discussed sparsely and scattered multifocally throughout the text. This is a topic that is not only technically and clinically relevant, but also seems to have engendered recent increased interest given the increased focus on the Radiology Board examinations. That being said, many common artifacts are available to the reader through the index.

This two-volume set would likely be an admirable, useful, and impressive contribution to the library of just about any physicians who routinely employ nuclear medicine techniques in their clinical practice. Moreover, it would also likely serve as a great reference tool for anyone who performs nuclear medicine imaging examinations or is studying them (such as technologists and trainees), refers patients for these examinations, or is involved in the physics or chemistry administration of a department.
