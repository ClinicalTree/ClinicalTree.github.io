A 2001 survey of general internists ranked computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging as the most important innovations in medicine of the preceding 30 years . These imaging modalities represent only two of a wide gamut of new technologies pioneered by radiologists that have advanced patient care. Whether relating to digital imaging, quantitative imaging biomarkers, or image-guided minimally invasive therapies, radiologists have remained continual leaders in conducting successful technologic research and rapidly translating such advances into routine practice. This legacy has been driven by radiologists' collective sense of curiosity, discovery, and innovation, coupled with a natural embrace of new technologies. By thus living at the forefront of science and medicine, radiologists have been well positioned to successfully usher in new channels for adding value to patient care.

The Radiology Research Alliance (RRA) of the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) seeks to promote innovative radiology research through a range of activities that target challenges in conducting such research and that stimulate research by radiologist investigators throughout their careers. In 2012, the RRA launched its first round of annual Task Forces. Now at its 5-year anniversary, the Task Forces program has become the RRA's signature initiative. Each Task Force reflects a current “mega-trend” in radiology or medicine in general, spanning topics within clinical care, research, education, administration, quality improvement, and beyond. Over the course of a year, Task Force members explore strategies for radiology researchers to leverage these trends to improve the field and ultimately impact patient care. The Task Forces consist of volunteers from programs throughout North America and at all career stages, including medical students, residents and fellows, junior and mid-career faculty, as well as vice-chairs and chairs. Collaborators from the basic sciences also commonly participate. Task Forces share their findings through an oral presentation at the annual meeting of the AUR, as well as via white paper submissions to _Academic Radiology_ . These white papers are intended to be practical and forward-thinking, identifying opportunities to enhance the practice of medicine and inspiring radiologists to take action based on such opportunities.

The diffusion of imaging advances into widespread practice entails active engagement of radiologists throughout the process, collaborating with other stakeholders. In the RRA Task Force white paper “Translating New Imaging Technologies to Clinical Practice” , Lee et al. explore the major phases of this pathway, including federal regulatory approval, early adoption, payment coverage, and broad adoption. These authors cover standard terminology, major milestones, radiology-industry partnership, potential political barriers, policy considerations, and advocacy efforts. Examples are provided using recent technical advances such as digital breast tomosynthesis, and the particular role for radiology leaders is highlighted. This white paper serves as a call to action to radiologists to act as champions of new imaging technologies, demonstrating and advocating for their value in patient care so as to support the described phases of adoption.

The development of new imaging advances arises from partnerships between clinical radiologists and scientists in a wide variety of areas, including biology, physics, engineering, and computing. In the RRA Task Force white paper “Promoting Collaborations Between Radiologists and Scientists” , Yu et al. present a framework for considering such relationships that radiologists foster with other disciplines. These authors provide an overview of successful collaborative efforts, opportunities for future collaborations, possible roadblocks, and proposed solutions. Specific disciplines that are discussed include medical physics, biology, informatics, and medical education. Their review is rich with clinical examples, including magnetic resonance imaging texture analysis, radiogenomics, computer-aided diagnosis, machine learning, and computed tomography-based human anatomy laboratories. This white paper is hoped to encourage readers to further embrace such multidisciplinary collaborations in their own research.

Multicenter research is valuable for improving the quality and impact of research by obtaining larger sample sizes from more diverse populations, thereby leading to more generalizable findings. However, there are unique challenges to multicenter research in radiology related to a gamut of issues in wide-scale image sharing among institutions. In the RRA Task Force white paper “Multi-Center Research Studies in Radiology” , Dashevsky et al. conducted a survey of radiology researchers who had published multicenter trials. The survey results identify perceived major barriers to multicenter radiology research (most notably, obtaining external funding), and resources for overcoming these. Based on the survey findings, it is advised that radiology researchers interested in multicenter research may be most effective by finding collaborators with similar interests through society meetings and conferences, ensuring highly motivated leadership for the team, and establishing regular group contact including at least one in-person meeting. Radiologists looking to embark on their own multicenter studies should find the Task Force's input helpful in their efforts.

Obtaining research funding is becoming a greater challenge, with funding from the National Institutes of Health becoming particularly competitive. In the RRA Task Force white paper “Radiology Research Funding: Current Status and Future Opportunities”, Chetlen et al outline essential components of creating and maintaining a successful radiology research program . These authors review currently available (both federal and nonfederal) funding sources for radiology researchers and highlight areas of likely growing opportunity for research funding in the field, for example comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes research. Opportunities for radiologists in terms of development of grant-wring skills and extramural seed grant funding are summarized. Strategies that are likely to improve radiology researchers' chances of success in obtaining funding in the current research funding climate are provided. The review will be a useful resource for junior radiology investigators seeking insights as to how to navigate an increasingly complex research landscape.
