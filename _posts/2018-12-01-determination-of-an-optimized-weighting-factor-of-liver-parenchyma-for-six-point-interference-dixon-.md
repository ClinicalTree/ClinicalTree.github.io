## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the optimal weighting factor (WF) for precise quantification using six-point interference Dixon fat percentage imaging by analyzing changes in WFs of fatty acid metabolites (FMs) in high-fat-induced fatty liver disease rat model.

## Materials and Methods

Individual FM-related WFs were calculated based on concentration ratios of integrated areas of seven peak FMs with four phantom series. Ten 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for baseline quantification of fat in liver magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance spectroscopy data. These seven lipid metabolites were then quantitatively analyzed. Spearman test was used for correlation analysis of different lipid proton concentrations. The most accurate WF for six-point interference Dixon fat percentage imaging was then determined.

## Results

The seven lipid resonance WF values obtained from magnetic resonance spectroscopy data for three different oils (oleic, linoleic, and soybean) were different from each other. In lipid phantoms, except for the phantom containing oleic acid, changes in FP values were significantly different when WFs were changed in six-point interference Dixon fat percentage image. The seven lipid resonance WF values for the nonalcoholic fatty liver animal model were different from human subcutaneous adipose tissue lipid WF values.

## Conclusions

WF affected the calculation of six-point interference Dixon-based fat percentage imaging value in phantom experiment. If WF of liver parenchyma FM which is specific to each liver disease is applied, the accuracy of six-point interference Dixon fat percentage imaging can be further increased.

## Introduction

Hepatic steatosis is a common disease that affects nearly 30% of the world's adult population . It can progress to liver fibrosis over time. It frequently causes liver cirrhosis or hepatic cellular carcinoma . Furthermore, transplantation of a moderately fatty liver can increase the risk of liver failure, making the evaluation of a donor's liver fat deposition extremely important .

Although liver biopsy is considered the most reliable procedure for evaluating fatty liver, it cannot be repeatedly done as it is an invasive examination with limitations such as potential for sampling error and interobserver variations . As a result, noninvasive methods are increasingly used for the evaluation of fatty liver. Among those techniques, the use of ultrasound scan also has disadvantages because it is highly sonographer-dependent without providing quantitative results .

![Figure 4, Lipid proton acquisition and lipid proton profile after high-fat (HF) induction using the same animal model. (a) HF diet rat model four-channel animal coil mount and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) acquisition. T2-weighted three phase images (axial, sagittal, and coronal) were acquired to obtain liver MRS data. (b) and (c) are 2- and 8-week LCModel MRS data, respectively. No change in the ratio of lipid proton in MRS data obtained in different periods was observed. In other words, as weighting factor (WF) did not change according to difference in intrahepatic fat deposition, six-point interference Dixon fat percentage imaging could be applied by using the same WF even if the degree of fatty liver was different.
