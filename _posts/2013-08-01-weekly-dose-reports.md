## Rationale and Objectives

Numerous protocols have been developed to reduce cardiac computed tomography angiography (cCTA) radiation dose while maintaining image quality. However, cCTA practice is highly dependent on physician and technologist experience and education. In this study, we sought to evaluate the incremental value of real-time feedback via weekly dose reports on a busy cCTA service.

## Materials and Methods

This time series analysis consisted of 450 consecutive patients whom underwent physician-supervised cCTA for clinically indicated native coronary evaluation between April 2011 and January 2013, with 150 patients before the initiation of weekly dose report (preintervention period: April–September 2011) and 150 patients after the initiation (postintervention period: September 2011–February 2012). To assess whether overall dose reductions were maintained over time, results were compared to a late control group consisting of 150 consecutive cCTA exams, which were performed after the study (September 2012–January 2013). Patient characteristics and effective radiation were recorded and compared.

## Results

Total radiation dose was significantly lower in the postintervention period (3.4 mSv \[1.7–5.7\] and in the late control group (3.3 mSv \[2.0–5.3\] versus the preintervention period (4.1 mSv \[2.1–6.6\] ( _P_ = .005). The proportion of high-dose outliers was also decreased in the postintervention period and late control period (exams <10 mSv were 88.0% preintervention vs. 97.3% postintervention vs. 95.3% late control; exams <15 mSv were 98.0% preintervention vs. 100.0% postintervention vs. 98.7% late control; exams <20.0 mSv were 98.7% preintervention vs. 100.0% postintervention vs. 100.0% late control).

## Conclusion

Weekly dose report feedback of site radiation doses to patients undergoing physician-supervised cCTA resulted in significant overall dose reduction and reduction of high-dose outliers. Overall dose reductions were maintained beyond the initial study period.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) has emerged as a reliable tool to exclude significant coronary artery disease in low- to intermediate-risk patients . Numerous technological advances have addressed radiation exposure , which previously was an important drawback of this new imaging modality . In selected patients, some scanners allow the reduction of the effective dose to <1 mSv . In nonobese patients, the use of decreased tube potential settings (available on all scanners) allows for significantly decreased radiation doses with preserved image quality .

The dose reduction potential of protocols tailored for specific parameters, chiefly heart rate and body mass index, has been demonstrated . Yet in the clinical setting, compliance with such protocols can be a challenge, because cCTA is a highly operator-dependent modality and is dramatically influenced by physicians' and technologists' experience and education . An important first step in the process of dose reduction (and any quality assurance method) is the accurate measurement, tracking, and communication of radiation doses .
