## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate whether the presence of facial photographs obtained at the point-of-care of portable radiography leads to increased detection of wrong-patient errors.

## Materials and Methods

In this institutional review board–approved study, 166 radiograph–photograph combinations were obtained from 30 patients. Consecutive radiographs from the same patients resulted in 83 unique pairs (ie, a new radiograph and prior, comparison radiograph) for interpretation. To simulate wrong-patient errors, mismatched pairs were generated by pairing radiographs from different patients chosen randomly from the sample. Ninety radiologists each interpreted a unique randomly chosen set of 10 radiographic pairs, containing up to 10% mismatches (ie, error pairs). Radiologists were randomly assigned to interpret radiographs with or without photographs. The number of mismatches was identified, and interpretation times were recorded.

## Results

Ninety radiologists with 21 ± 10 (mean ± standard deviation) years of experience were recruited to participate in this observer study. With the introduction of photographs, the proportion of errors detected increased from 31% (9 of 29) to 77% (23 of 30; _P_ = .006). The odds ratio for detection of error with photographs to detection without photographs was 7.3 (95% confidence interval: 2.29–23.18). Observer qualifications, training, or practice in cardiothoracic radiology did not influence sensitivity for error detection. There is no significant difference in interpretation time for studies without photographs and those with photographs (60 ± 22 vs. 61 ± 25 seconds; _P_ = .77).

## Conclusions

In this observer study, facial photographs obtained simultaneously with portable chest radiographs increased the identification of any wrong-patient errors, without substantial increase in interpretation time. This technique offers a potential means to increase patient safety through correct patient identification.

The Institute of Medicine's Quality Report estimates that nearly 98,000 deaths annually may be attributed to medical errors . Within radiology, an important source of error is the _wrong-patient error_ , wherein one patient's imaging study may be placed in another patient's folder in a picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Such errors can create problems for both the involved patients. In fact, the National Quality Forum recognizes that wrong-patient errors can affect radiologic practice and that agency, along with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, specifically endorses implementation of a “standardized protocol to prevent mislabeling of radiographs” .

Based on a statewide adverse event reporting system, the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority published that, in 2009, it received 652 reports on radiology events: 196 (30.1%) of these reported events were related to wrong-patient events. Of these 196 wrong-patient events, 93 (47%) occurred in the imaging modality of radiography. The report concluded that such errors “occur more frequently than health care providers and patients may realize” despite various quality improvement measures .

(a) The radiograph–photograph combination on the left refers to the present study and shows a 64-year-old white woman with history of aortic stenosis and aortic valve replacement. (b) The radiograph–photograph combination on the right refers to the prior study, which shows a radiograph obtained 2 months earlier, of a 73-year-old man also with a history of aortic stenosis and aortic valve replacement. The radiographic differences are subtle and mainly related to body habitus. The presence of the photographs show more obvious differences in hair color and body habitus, and the observer asked to interpret this case correctly identified the wrong-patient error.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AMultiobserverStudyoftheEffectsofIncludingPointofcarePatientPhotographswithPortableRadiography/0_1s20S1076633214001056.jpg)

![Figure 4, Representative wrong-patient error without photographs. (a) An 89-year-old white man with a history of aortic stenosis, status post surgical aortic valve replacement; median sternotomy wires are seen with proper window-level settings. (b) Radiograph obtained 3 weeks earlier, used to serve as a comparison for (a) in a wrong-patient error scheme, shows a 63-year-old woman also with a history of aortic stenosis, status post percutaneous aortic valve replacement. Differences in the prosthetic valves, sternotomy wires, and vascular and nodal calcifications in both patients are evident. It is unlikely that a person who has undergone surgical aortic valve replacement (the patient in b ) would subsequently undergo percutaneous aortic valve replacement and have the medical sternotomy wires removed in the same 3-week period (the patient in a ). Even more illogical is the development of advanced calcified atherosclerotic disease and calcified mediastinal lymph nodes within 3 weeks. Despite these obvious differences, the observer who was shown this combination did not identify the wrong-patient error.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AMultiobserverStudyoftheEffectsofIncludingPointofcarePatientPhotographswithPortableRadiography/3_1s20S1076633214001056.jpg)
