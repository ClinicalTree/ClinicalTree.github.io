Automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS) is a new imaging technology for automatic breast scanning through ultrasound. It was first developed to overcome the limitation of operator dependency and lack of standardization and reproducibility of handheld ultrasound. ABUS provides a three-dimensional representation of breast tissue and allows images reformatting in three planes, and the generated coronal plane has been suggested to improve diagnostic accuracy.

This technique has been first used in the screening setting to improve breast cancer detection, especially in mammographically dense breasts. In recent years, numerous studies also evaluated its use in the diagnostic setting: they showed its suitability for breast cancer staging, evaluation of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and second-look ultrasound after magnetic resonance imaging.

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the current body of literature about the clinical performance of ABUS, summarize available evidence, and identify gaps in knowledge for future research.

## Introduction

Handheld ultrasound (HHUS) is an essential diagnostic tool to detect and characterize breast lesions, complementary to digital mammography (DM). In particular, HHUS is mandatory to confirm the finding and to guide biopsy of the suspicious lesion when an abnormality is evidenced on DM (Breast imaging-reporting and data system \[BI-RADS\] 4–5) .

HHUS can also depict breast cancers, which are at the same time occult on DM, especially in dense breasts (American college of radiology \[ACR\] BI-RADS breast composition category d), where the sensitivity of DM is lower (47.8%–64.4%) .

However, HHUS is operator-dependent, and in such stetting lacks standardization and reproducibility; it also requires considerable physician time for acquisition. Automated breast ultrasonography (ABUS), also known as automated breast volumetric scanner, has been developed to overcome these limitations. ABUS is a new imaging technology based on automated scanning of the breast using ultrasounds with high-frequency broadband transducers. This provides three-dimensional (3D) representation of breast tissue and allows image reformatting in three planes.
