## Highlights

- Epicardial fat volume is independently associated with the presence and severity of systemic sclerosis.

- Extrapericardial fat volume is only associated with the presence of systemic sclerosis.

- Coronary artery calcification is not independently associated with systemic sclerosis.


## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to determine if intrathoracic fat volumes are associated with the presence and severity of systemic sclerosis (SSc), defined by the presence of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

The pericardium divides the intrathoracic fat into two fat depots. The fat on the inner side of the pericardium and around the heart is epicardial fat and the fat outside of the pericardium is extrapericardial fat.

![Figure 3, Column graph showing intrathoracic fat volumes and body mass index (BMI) in controls and systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients without and with associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Intrathoracic fat volumes (epicardial fat volume [EFV], extrapericardial fat volume [EPFV], and intrathoracic fat volume [ITFV] are scaled to the left y-axis, and BMI is scaled to the right y-axis). This graph demonstrates significant difference of epicardial fat volume across the groups, whereas BMI demonstrates no difference across the groups. Note that patients with SSc-associated PAH have the most extensive epicardial fat volume than patients with SSc alone and controls.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/IncreasedEpicardialFatVolumeIsIndependentlyAssociatedwiththePresenceandSeverityofSystemicSclerosis/2_1s20S1076633217303276.jpg)
