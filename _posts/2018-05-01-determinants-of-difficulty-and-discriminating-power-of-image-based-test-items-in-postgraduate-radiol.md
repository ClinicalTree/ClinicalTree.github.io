## Rationale and Objectives

The psychometric characteristics of image-based test items in radiological written examinations are not well known. In this study, we explored difficulty and discriminating power of these test items in postgraduate radiological digital examinations.

## Materials and Methods

We reviewed test items of seven Dutch Radiology Progress Tests (DRPTs) that were taken from October 2013 to April 2017. The DRPT is a semiannual formative examination, required for all Dutch radiology residents. We assessed several stimulus and response characteristics of test items. The response format of test items included true or false, single right multiple choice with 2, 3, 4, or ≥5 answer options, pick-N multiple-choice, drag-and-drop, and long-list-menu formats. We calculated item _P_ values and item-rest-correlation (Rir) values to assess difficulty and discriminating power. We performed linear regression analysis in image-based test items to investigate whether _P_ and Rir values were significantly related to stimulus and response characteristics. Also, we compared psychometric indices between image-based test items and text-alone items.

## Results

_P_ and Rir values of image-based items ( _n_ = 369) were significantly related to the type of response format ( _P_ < .001), and not to which of the seven DRPTs the item was obtained from, radiological subspecialty domain, nonvolumetric or volumetric character of images, or context-rich or context-free character of the stimulus. When accounted for type of response format, difficulty and discriminating power of image-based items did not differ significantly from text-alone items ( _n_ = 881). Test items with a relatively large number of answer options were generally more difficult, and discriminated better among high- and low-performing candidates.

## Conclusion

In postgraduate radiological written examinations, difficulty and discriminating power of image-based test items are related to the type of response format and are comparable to those of text-alone items. We recommend a response format with a relatively large number of answer options to optimize psychometric indices of radiological image-based test items.

## Introduction

Radiological knowledge and visual skills are imperative in the profession of a radiologist and are therefore trained during residency. To assess whether residents have reached sufficient competence in these domains, both workplace assessments and written examinations are essential. In many countries, written examinations are included in radiology residency programs . These examinations usually contain image-based test items in addition to text-alone items. Although radiological images were traditionally x-ray photos, they are nowadays, to a large extent, obtained through cross-sectional techniques, such as computed tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging.

## Test Item Characteristics

Viewed from the perspective of test theory, test items in examinations can be characterized by their stimulus and their response format . The stimulus refers to what is being asked by the test item and is considered the main determinant of what type of competence is tested . The stimulus may be context-rich or context-free. Context-rich items consist of a (case) scenario and ask for decisions that are related to the scenario, whereas context-free items are mainly aimed at testing factual knowledge . The response format refers to how the candidate's answer is captured. Examples of response formats are true or false items, multiple-choice questions with a single best answer option, and long-list-menu items with a large number of predefined answer options . All answers of the candidate lead to a test score for the examination. According to classical test theory, the observed test score is the summation of the true score (the candidate's actual knowledge) and measurement errors . Sources of measurement errors are the test itself, the testee, and the tester . The amount of measurement error is estimated by calculating the reliability of the test. If measurement errors are reduced, the observed score of the candidate will approach the true score . Postexamination item analysis is recommended to investigate how test items perform in light of the objectives of the examination . In classical test theory, this analysis typically involves computing item difficulty and discrimination indices . Obviously, such psychometric characteristics have to be sound if the objective of the examination is to identify candidates who have not attained expected learning outcomes .
