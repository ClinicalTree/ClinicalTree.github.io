My meeting finished early and I went to the store, thinking she might be tired of walking around. No sign of mother. I waited until 4 o’clock. Still no mother. I began to range around the store, with no success. A half hour passed. The store was to close at five o’clock.

I shied away from telling a sales person that I had lost my mother. After all, I was only 35. So I kept ranging around. About a quarter before 5, I heard myself paged. When I answered, someone said, “Your mother has been waiting for you for an hour. Where have you been?”
