## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to provide normal values of volumetry and linear dimensions of adrenal glands.

## Materials and Methods

Contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography scans of 105 patients were evaluated in this retrospective study. Imaging software was used both to measure the adrenal gland volume and to determine linear dimensions and density. For interobserver reliability, determination was repeated by a second reader in 10 patients selected at random.

## Results

The mean adrenal volume was 4.84 (±1.67) cm³ on the left side and 3.62 (±1.23) cm³ on the right side. The total adrenal volume was mainly influenced by body weight ( _P_ < .001) and gender with women having smaller glands on average. The total width of the adrenal gland was 15.80 (±3.05) mm on the right side and 18.96 (±3.37) mm on the left side. There was a significant correlation between volume and linear measurements ( _P_ < .001). The mean density of both adrenal glands was 32.66 (±19.64) HU. Overall, interobserver reliability was high for volumetry (left adrenal, _r_ = 0.98; right adrenal, _r_ = 0.90) and low for linear dimensions.

## Conclusions

Normal data for volumetry and linear dimensions are provided. There is a concordance between volumetric and linear assessment. However, volumetry is more reproducible.

## Key points:

- Normal data for volumetry and linear dimensions are provided.

Formulas for calculation of adrenal gland volumes are derived from multiple linear regression analysis (left, right and total volume \[volume in milliliters, weight in kilograms, age in years\]. Numbers in parentheses have to be subtracted in female subjects). Predictors (weight, sex, and age) are characterized by B-weight, β-weight, SE (β), RP-Rest and _P_ (RSP).
