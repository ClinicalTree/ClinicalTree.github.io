Recent discoveries characterizing the molecular basis of lung cancer brought fundamental changes in lung cancer treatment. The authors review the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer, including genomic abnormalities, targeted therapies, and resistance mechanisms, and discuss lung cancer imaging with novel techniques. Knowledge of the molecular basis of lung cancer is essential for radiologists to properly interpret imaging and assess response to therapy. Quantitative and functional imaging helps assessing the biologic behavior of lung cancer.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men and women in the United States and worldwide, accounting for 30% of estimated cancer deaths in men and 26% of estimated cancer deaths in women in the United States in 2009 (  Fig 1 ) . In addition, the mortality rate of lung cancer is much higher than that of other top three causes of cancer death, including breast, prostate, and colon cancer (  Fig 2 ) . Eighty-five percent of patients with lung cancer have non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which the 5-year survival rate is only 15% . Two thirds of patients with NSCLC present with advanced disease and are considered incurable by surgery or radiotherapy. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, the standard of care for these patients, is also marginally effective. It has been clear in the past decades that more effective systemic therapy is needed for patients with advanced lung cancer .

Recent advances in molecular biology have elucidated the different molecular mechanisms of lung cancer development and progression. Some of these genetic abnormalities are specific to lung cancer, while others are present in other cancers. One of the major discoveries was the identification of somatic activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain in NSCLC. The somatic mutations of _EGFR_ are associated with a dramatic clinical response to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib . The discovery of _EGFR_ mutations and the clinical application of this finding for the selection of therapy have transformed the way oncologists approach lung cancer and plan treatment. It is also a pragmatic example of the contributions that advances in basic molecular research have made to patient care in clinical oncology. As radiologists involved in imaging of patients with lung cancer, we should be familiar with these molecular bases of determining therapies and applications that our oncology colleagues are using. Radiologists should become familiar with the molecular background of lung cancer and its new molecular-targeted treatment approach, to properly validate, use, and apply our advanced imaging technology to diagnose, assess response, and define progressive disease. This will help radiologists contribute in a clinically significant manner as cancer imaging specialists to the management and further progress of care for patients with lung cancer.

In this review article, we describe different molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of lung cancer, initially focusing on _EGFR_ mutations in NSCLC, their therapeutic application, and current challenges. The role of histology in lung cancer assessment in current clinical oncology is also discussed. We present information on different imaging approaches to lung cancer, including conventional response assessment methods and their limitations, newer quantitative and functional imaging with multi–detector row computed tomographic (CT) imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and combined positron emission tomographic (PET) and CT imaging. The current status of these advanced imaging techniques in lung cancer is described, their current challenges are outlined, and future directions are proposed.

## Molecular mechanisms of lung cancer

## _EGFR_ Mutation and Its Inhibitors in NSCLC

The EGFR is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor involved in signaling pathways of cells, and it regulates important tumorigenic processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion (  Fig 3 ) . Overexpression of EGFR is frequently noted in the development and progression of NSCLC, and its presence is associated with shortened survival . To specifically target this EGFR pathway in NSCLC, small-molecule inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were developed, and erlotinib and gefitinib have been approved for therapy of patients with advanced NSCLC in different parts of the world . Subsequently, activating _EGFR_ mutations were discovered in cancer cells from patients with NSCLC who responded to the targeted therapy with gefitinib and erlotinib .
