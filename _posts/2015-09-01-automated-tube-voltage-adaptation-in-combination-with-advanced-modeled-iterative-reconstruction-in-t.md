## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate image quality and radiation exposure of portal venous–phase thoracoabdominal third-generation 192-slice dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) with automated tube voltage adaptation (TVA) in combination with advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE).

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-one patients underwent oncologic portal venous–phase thoracoabdominal follow-up CT twice within 7 months. The initial examination was performed on second-generation 128-slice DSCT with fixed tube voltage of 120 kV in combination with filtered back projection reconstruction. The second examination was performed on a third-generation 192-slice DSCT using automated TVA in combination with ADMIRE. Attenuation and image noise of liver, spleen, renal cortex, aorta, vena cava inferior, portal vein, psoas muscle, and perinephric fat were measured. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. Radiation dose was assessed as size-specific dose estimates (SSDE). Subjective image quality was assessed by two observers using five-point Likert scales. Interobserver agreement was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).

## Results

Automated TVA set tube voltage to 90 kV ( _n_ = 8), 100 kV ( _n_ = 31), 110 kV ( _n_ = 11), or 120 kV ( _n_ = 1). Average SSDE was decreased by 34.9% using 192-slice DSCT compared to 128-slice 120-kV DSCT (7.8 ± 2.4 vs. 12.1 ± 3.2 mGy; _P_ < .001). Image noise was substantially lower; SNR and CNR were significantly increased in 192-slice DSCT compared to 128-slice DSCT (all _P_ < .005). Image quality was voted excellent for both acquisition techniques (5.00 vs. 4.93; _P_ = .083).

## Conclusions

Automated TVA in combination with ADMIRE on third-generation 192-slice DSCT in portal venous–phase thoracoabdominal CT provides excellent image quality with reduced image noise and increased SNR and CNR, whereas average radiation dose is reduced by 34.9% compared to 128-slice DSCT.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) is a well-established cross-sectional imaging technique in oncologic patients . Because CT may account for majority substantial amount of radiation exposure in oncologic patients , new technical innovations have focused on improvement of image quality and further radiation dose reduction to keep radiation dose “as low as reasonably achievable” .

Several techniques for radiation dose reduction have been proposed . Tube current modulation (TCM) adapts tube current to the body's anatomy in real-time and is activated on most currently available CT systems . Tube voltage reduction is another promising technique for radiation dose reduction and can be performed using automated attenuation-based software . A potential drawback of low–tube-voltage acquisition is an increase in image noise, which may impair diagnostic image quality. Therefore, manual adjustment of tube voltage on an individual basis may be challenging. Automated tube voltage adaptation (TVA) can adapt tube voltage to the patient body based on attenuation measurements, maintaining sufficient image quality, even in low-kilovoltage examinations. Furthermore, the application of iterative reconstruction (IR) techniques can substantially reduce image noise .
