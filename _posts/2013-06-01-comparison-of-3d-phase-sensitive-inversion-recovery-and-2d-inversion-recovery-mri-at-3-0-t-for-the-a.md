## Rationale and Objectives

To compare free-breathing three-dimensional (3D) phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) with breath-holding two-dimensional (2D) IR sequences to determine which is better for detecting and characterizing myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty HCM patients clinically underwent 3.0 T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging that included 3D-PSIR and 2D-IR. The amount of LGE lesions was calculated and expressed as %LGE of the myocardial mass, and the average of the %LGE value reported by two observers was recorded as the final %LGE. We also counted the number of LGE lesions and recorded their location. The myocardium-LGE contrast, margin sharpness, artifacts, and overall image quality were graded on a 4-point grading scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = excellent).

## Results

The mean %LGE on 2D-IR was 24.7 ± 0.6, 17.5 ± 0.6, and 8.5 ± 0.3, respectively, for the basal, mid-, and apical myocardium; the corresponding values were 24.2 ± 0.4, 20.0 ± 0.4, and 7.7 ± 0.3 on 3D-PSIR (2D-IR versus 3D-PSIR, _P_ = .87). On 2D IR and 3D-PSIR images, 13, 52, and 53, and 9, 74, and 33 LGE lesions were detected in the subendocardial, midwall, subepicardial area, respectively. The myocardium-LGE contrast and overall image quality were significantly higher on 3D-PSIR than 2D-IR images ( _P_ < .001); the sequences did not differ significantly with respect to margin sharpness and artifact.

## Conclusion

Three-dimensional PSIR sequence yields higher image contrast, better image quality, and greater detection ability for LGE lesions than 2D-IR sequence.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging at 1.5- and 3.0-T machines yields high spatial and contrast resolution and is now accepted as a valuable tool for the evaluation of many cardiac diseases . It is particularly useful for the assessment of cardiomyopathies because it can depict different myocardial enhancement patterns on inversion-recovery (IR) late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images . Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) have a genetically anomalous, usually hypercontractile and asymmetric, myocardium that may obstruct output and result in sudden cardiac death. The estimated incidence of HCM is 1 in 500 in the general population . Evidence has emerged that myocardial fibrosis is a relatively early manifestation of HCM and that it may have a pathophysiological role in sudden cardiac death . Adabag et al found that LGE was an independent risk factor for HCM that was reflected in a 7.3-fold increase in the RR interval during nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, a potential risk factor for sudden death . LGE CMR imaging can depict the peculiar pattern of fibrosis whose increase is observed in patients at risk for major cardiac events . Therefore, the evaluation of the distribution and extent of LGE is clinically important for risk stratification and the management of HCM patients.

At LGE-CMR studies, two-dimensional (2D) IR images are conventionally acquired under breath-holding and an optimal inversion recovery time (TI) must be selected. Myocardial fibrosis is located in the area of hypertrophy; it can be patchy with multiple foci or distributed diffusely . As small or patchy LGE lesions can be missed on conventional 2D IR images because of noncontiguous slice coverage attributable to misregistration between breath holds, three-dimensional (3D) phase-sensitive IR (PSIR) under free breathing has been proposed as a technique to detect LGE lesions . Advantages of this technique include the consistent contrast and appearance over a relatively wide range of TI . The introduction of 3.0-T MR machines has been increasing in the clinical settings; however, there were no reports that evaluated the potentials of PSIR sequence for diagnosis of cardiomyopathy at a 3.0-T machine.
