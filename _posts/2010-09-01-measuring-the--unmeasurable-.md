## Rationale and Objectives

To determine if anatomically “nonmeasurable” disease in bone marrow (BM) is assessable for response to therapy by \[  18 F\]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

FDG PET/CT images of 27 patients with lymphoma, FDG-avid bone marrow (BM) lesions, and ≥1 FDG-avid, tumor-involved lymph node (LN) at baseline were retrospectively reviewed. FDG uptake in target LNs and BM foci was determined pre- and posttherapy using the standardized uptake value corrected for lean body mass (SUL  mean ). Size of the same target LNs was measured pre- and posttherapy on CT. Percentage decreases of LN size and LN and BM SUL were calculated. Response was classified according to revised International Workshop Criteria (IWC) with and without modification for metabolic evaluation of BM and correlated to overall survival. Statistical analyses were performed using paired _t_ -tests, Pearson correlation coefficients, and z-tests.

## Results

LN size, LN SUL  mean , and BM SUL  mean were significantly higher pre- versus posttherapy (2337 mm  2 ± 1810 vs. 309 mm  2 ± 323; 6.94 ± 4.96 vs. 1.02 ± 1.00; and 6.81 ± 4.58 to 1.84 ± 1.58, all _P_ < .001, respectively). After therapy, significant correlation was found between percentage declines of LN size and SUL  mean of LNs ( _r_ = 0.84, _P_ < .001) or BM ( _r_ = 0.56, _P_ = .002) and SUL  mean of LN and BM ( _r_ = 0.76, _P_ < .001). Including a metabolic assessment of BM correctly altered overall response assessment in 5/27 (19%) patients and better predicted overall survival than revised IWC.

## Conclusion

Anatomically “unmeasurable” BM infiltration with lymphoma behaves similarly to LN disease after therapy and is “measurable” by FDG PET/CT. FDG PET/CT is valuable for monitoring tumor response in “measurable” disease and BM, which was previously considered “unmeasurable” by anatomical imaging.

Tumor involvement of bone marrow (BM) in patients with lymphoma defines a higher stage and portends a worse prognosis. Biopsy is the current standard for diagnosing lymphomatous infiltration of BM. Sensitivity for identifying disease in BM increases 10%–20% by multiple sampling; however, even with negative bilateral biopsies, patients may subsequently prove to have BM disease .

Bone and BM lesions are considered “nonmeasurable” in therapy response criteria, which are primarily based on anatomic imaging. The terms “measurable” and “nonmeasurable” were introduced in the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) approach . Per RECIST, “measurable lesions” can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the longest diameter being ≥10 or 20 mm depending on computed tomography (CT) technique. Bone lesions and several others (eg, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, leptomeningeal disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions) are specifically considered as “truly nonmeasurable” per RECIST. Although no direct measurements of tumor burden are taken, response of “nonmeasurable” lesions is “considered” when assigning a posttreatment response classification.

Intense FDG uptake is also seen in lymph nodes behind the sternum.
