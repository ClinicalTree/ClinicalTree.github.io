## Rationale and Objectives

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a complex and fatal disease that is difficult to diagnose noninvasively. This study evaluated previously published computed tomography–based vessel measurement criteria and investigated the predictive power and diagnostic ability of the main pulmonary artery diameter (MPAD) and the ratio of MPAD to aorta diameter (rPA).

## Materials and Methods

The database for this study consisted of 175 PH patients (for whom mean pulmonary artery pressure \[mPAP\] was known), 16 patients without PH but with known mPAP (non-PH patients), and 114 “normal” patients without known mPAP. The performance of previously published criteria, MPAD > 29 mm and rPA > 1, was determined. The relationship between vessel measurements and mPAP was evaluated through correlation and linear regression analysis. The ability of these measurements to discriminate between patients with and without PH was determined by receiver operating characteristic analysis.

## Results

For discriminating between PH and “normal” patients, the sensitivity and specificity of the criterion MPAD > 29 mm were 0.89 (0.84–0.93) and 0.83 (0.76–0.90), respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of the criterion rPA > 1 were 0.89 (0.85–0.94) and 0.82 (0.74–0.89), respectively. At a specificity of 0.95 in the task of separating PH and “normal” patients, the sensitivity of MPAD was 0.81 (0.72–0.90) and the sensitivity of rPA was 0.76 (0.66–0.85), but the specificity for both decreased when non-PH patients were included. For the combined PH and non-PH patient groups, the correlation between the vessel measurements and mPAP was significant but low, and the ability of the vessel measurements to predict mPAP was limited.

## Conclusion

This study found that the sensitivity of previously published vessel criteria for identifying PH patients is high, but the specificity may not be high enough for routine use in a clinical patient population.

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a fatal disease that is not diagnosed early because patients typically present to their doctor with symptoms associated with advanced disease . PH has a wide range of etiologies and requires a complex clinical classification scheme . PH is classified into five groups. PH group 1, which is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), includes idiopathic PAH and heritable PAH among others, and PH groups 2–5 include PH resulting from left heart disease, lung diseases and/or hypoxia, chronic thromboembolic disease, or unclear multifactorial mechanisms, respectively. A mean arterial pulmonary pressure (mPAP) > 25 mm Hg at rest or > 30 mm Hg with exercise as determined by right heart catheterization (RHC) is required but not sufficient to be diagnosed with PH because additional criteria must be met .

PH has nonspecific symptoms that make it difficult to diagnose noninvasively. Consequently, patient evaluation normally requires numerous diagnostic tests. The diagnostic evaluation of PH includes physical examination, electrocardiography, pulmonary function tests, blood gas analysis, ventilation/perfusion scan, echocardiography, and RHC with vasodilatory testing. Although RHC is the gold standard for the diagnosis of PH , it is an invasive procedure. Echocardiography is a noninvasive means to assess heart function and blood pressures, but the accuracy of the pressure measurements obtained through echocardiography is suboptimal because of differences when compared with RHC .
