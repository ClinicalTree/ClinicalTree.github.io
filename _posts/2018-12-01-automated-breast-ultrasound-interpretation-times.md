## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to determine the average time for breast radiologists of varied experience to interpret automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) examinations.

## Materials and Methods

A reader performance study was conducted on female patients, with ACR BI-RADS 4 breast density classifications of C or D, who received both an ABUS screening examination and a digital mammogram from 2013 to 2014 at an academic institution. Three faculty breast radiologists with varied levels of ABUS experience (advanced, intermediate, novice) read all ABUS examinations, with interpretation times and final impressions (categorized as “normal” or “abnormal”) recorded for each examination.

## Results

Ninety-nine patients were included, with all readers demonstrating an average ABUS interpretation time of less than 3 minutes. Compared to the other two readers, the intermediate reader had a significantly longer mean interpretation time at 2.6 minutes (95% confidence interval 2.4–2.8; _P_ < .001). In addition to having the shortest mean interpretation time, the novice reader also demonstrated reduced times in subsequent interpretations, with a significant decrease in interpretation times of 3.1 seconds (95% confidence interval 0.4–5.8) for every 10 ABUS examinations interpreted ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Overall, mean ABUS interpretation time by radiologists of all experience levels was short, at less than 3 minutes per examination, which should not deter radiologists from incorporating ABUS examinations into a busy clinical environment.

## Introduction

Although overall breast cancer-related mortality has steadily decreased over the last 30 years, in part due to major advances in mammographic screening, it remains a leading cause of death among US women . The sensitivity of screening mammography has been shown to be as low as 30%–48% in patients with dense breasts, which constitute nearly 50% of the screening population , because of a masking effect by the density for cancer visualization . Moreover, breast density is a strong, independent risk factor for the development of breast cancer, with studies demonstrating an increased lifetime risk of 2.8–6.0 times that of women with less dense, fatty breast tissue and a 6.1–17.8 greater risk of interval cancers in women with extremely dense breasts . Supplemental breast cancer screening with handheld ultrasound has documented an increased detection rate of approximately three to four cancers per thousand women with dense breasts, and, as 85% of cancers detected by screening ultrasound alone are invasive and node negative, ultrasound has become a particularly appealing method of screening . Although ultrasound can help address the challenges of cancer detection in dense breasts, traditional handheld ultrasound has several important limitations, including operator dependency, variable scan quality and reproducibility, and long acquisition times, which raise concerns for broad-scale implementation as an adjunct breast cancer screening tool .

Automated breast ultrasound (ABUS), which is a US Food and Drug Administration–approved adjunct-screening tool specifically for women with dense breast tissue , has the potential to overcome several limitations of handheld screening ultrasound because it acquires three-dimensional (3D) volumes viewable in three orthogonal planes, reducing operator variability and subjectivity . However, as alternative screening methodologies such as ABUS are gaining popularity, questions have been raised regarding time required for radiologist interpretation of the ABUS examination. Typical acquisition time for ABUS volumes is approximately 6 minutes in 20- to 30-minute examination slots, which compares favorably to typical 30-minute slots for handheld ultrasound examinations . Additionally, both mammography technologists and sonographers of varying skill levels can be trained to acquire ABUS images, obviating the need for highly trained ultrasound technologists who perform large-scale handheld ultrasound screenings .

This scatterplot demonstrates changes in the length of ABUS examination interpretations over time. The novice reader (red stars) significantly improved interpretation times when measured across subsequent examinations, with a decrease of 3.1 seconds (95% confidence interval 0.4–5.8) for every 10 ABUS examinations interpreted ( P < .05). Examination interpretation times for the advanced (blue squares) and intermediate readers (black circles) remained unchanged over time.
