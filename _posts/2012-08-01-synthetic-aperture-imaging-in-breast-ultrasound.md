## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the image quality between conventional and synthetic aperture (SA) imaging in breast ultrasound (US).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-four patients with 31 breast lesions were included in our study. The US data were processed with SA algorithm. For quantitative analysis, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were calculated. For qualitative analysis, conventional and SA images were reviewed by three radiologists and diagnostic preference (conspicuity, margin sharpness, and contrast) was assessed. The radiologists also determined whether artifacts were present. Parameters were analyzed using a paired _t_ -test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and chi-square test.

## Results

The mean CNRs were higher in SA images compared with conventional images (mean, 2.56 versus 2.28, _P_ = .004). The mean SNRs were higher in SA images compared with conventional images (31.62 versus 25.26, _P_ < .0001). SA images were considered as being “better” or “much better” in 16–23 (51.6–74.2%) lesions of total 31 lesions for conspicuity, in 17–24 (45.2%–77.4%) for margin sharpness, and in 13–23 (41.9%–74.2%) for contrast. Significant preferences in SA images were demonstrated (conspicuity, _P_ < .05 for all radiologists; margin sharpness and contrast in two radiologists). Refraction and speckle artifacts were less frequently observed in SA images (refraction, _P_ < .05 for all radiologists; speckle, _P_ < .05 for two radiologists), whereas reflection artifacts were more frequent in SA images ( _P_ < .05 in two radiologists).

## Conclusion

SA imaging provides better image quality than conventional imaging in patients with focal breast lesions in breast US.

## Introduction

Ultrasonography (US) of the breast plays a critical role in the diagnosis and management of breast diseases. US with a high-frequency transducer is essential for noninvasive diagnosis of screening-detected or palpable masses, and it allows radiologists to differentiate between benign or malignant masses using descriptive parameters . The limitations of US, however, are that it is operator-dependent and has considerable interobserver variability in terms of radiologists' descriptions and assessments of breast lesions . Because inherent artifacts, such as speckle, acoustic shadowing, and acoustic enhancement, can compromise image quality and contribute to the inconsistent and inaccurate interpretation of breast images, several US techniques had been developed and are commercially used to overcome these problems . Nevertheless, conventional US still has its own set of problems (eg, fixed transmit focus and limitation of penetration) that is responsible for compromising image quality.

Synthetic aperture (SA) imaging is a US algorithm technique that can potentially provide higher image quality than conventional imaging by using the superposition of the acoustic fields The SA technique was originally developed from synthetic aperture radar for geological and sonar applications, but it has been modified for use in medical imaging for several decades . The major difference between SA and conventional imaging is that SA imaging simultaneously produces the full range of images at each transmission, whereas a single image line is built sequentially to form the full range of an image in conventional imaging. In SA imaging, the simultaneously obtained full range of the images yields low-resolution images, which are synthesized to create a high-resolution image (  Fig 1 ) . During this process, the SA imaging system calculates the transmit focus in all points of an image with information from each emission, which provides more uniform resolution beyond the fixed focus depth.

![Figure 1, Schematic illustrations of conventional and synthetic aperture (SA) imaging. In conventional imaging, an image is formed by sequentially building up each image line achieved at each transmission. In SA imaging, a full line of low-resolution image is produced from each transmission, and the low-resolution images are synthesized coherently to provide a high-resolution image.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/SyntheticApertureImaginginBreastUltrasound/0_1s20S1076633212001821.jpg)
