Long-awaited third edition of the _Arthritis in Black and White_ has finally arrived. The second edition was published in 1997 and remains a classic “must-read” textbook for radiologists-in-training.

The book is largely divided into two parts. The first part is entitled “Approach to radiographic changes observed in a specific joint” and further divided into chapters for hand, foot, hip, knee, shoulder, sacroiliac joint, and spine. The second part is entitled “Radiographic changes observed in a specific articular disease” and is subdivided into 14 chapters covering various arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis. This design allows for readers to use the first section to learn good sets of differential diagnoses for various findings of arthritis or to figure out the diagnosis of their particular case. The second part is useful for comprehensive understanding of each arthropathy and comparing to each other.

Like the prior editions, this edition retains succinct and eloquent text along with very good quality images in every chapter. The new edition differs from the prior editions in including cross-sectional imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and computed tomography. In addition, the book comes with an activation code for additional material on line at  www.expertconsult.com . This book is an excellent resource not only for radiology residents and fellows, but also for practicing general radiologists.
