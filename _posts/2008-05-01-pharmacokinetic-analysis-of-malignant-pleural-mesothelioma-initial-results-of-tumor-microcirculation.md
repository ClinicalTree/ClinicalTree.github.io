## Rationale and Objectives

Malignant mesothelioma (MM) of the pleura is an aggressive and often fatal neoplasm. Because MM frequently demonstrates marked angiogenesis, it may be responsive to antiangiogenic therapy, but effective methods for selecting and monitoring of patients are further needed. We employed dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and quantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC) to characterize the microvascularity of MM using both a physiologic and ultrastructural method.

## Materials and Methods

Nineteen patients diagnosed with MM were enrolled and DCE-MRI was performed before antiangiogenic treatment. For each patient, tumor regions were characterized by their DCE-MRI–derived pharmacokinetic parameters (Amp, k  ep , k  el ), which were also compared to those of normal tissue (aorta, liver, spleen, and muscle). In addition, quantitative IHC of representative samples was performed with CD-34 staining to compare the calculated microvessel density (MVD) results with DCE-MRI results.

## Results

MM demonstrated markedly abnormal pharmacokinetic properties compared with normal tissues. Among the parameters tested, Amp was significantly different in MM ( _P_ ≤ .001) compared to normal organs. Despite the observation that the MVD of mesotheliomas in this series was high compared to other tumors, DCE-MRI pharmacokinetic parameters had a moderately positive correlation with MVD ( _r_ = 0.5).

## Conclusions

DCE-MRI and IHC can be used in patients with MM to visualize tumor microvascularity and to characterize tumor heterogeneity. DCE-MRI and IHC results positively correlated, though moderately, but these two methods present as essential tumor biomarkers. This multimodal characterization may be useful in selecting possible tumor subtypes that would benefit from antiangiogenic therapy.

Malignant epithelioid mesothelioma (MM) is one of the three main types of mesotheliomas. It is an aggressive tumor of the pleura and often fatal. Most, if not all, MMs are associated with prior exposure to asbestos ( ). Although this epithelioid type has the best prognosis, standard treatment regimens, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation are often unsuccessful (median survival 9 months). Nevertheless, long-term survivors have been reported, and new chemotherapy and multimodal regimens show promising results ( ).

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a new biomarker imaging technique and a method of characterizing tumor's neovascularity in situ ( ) as well as assessing the effects of therapy on tumor angiogenesis ( ). DCE-MRI is a noninvasive procedure in which sequential images with high spatial and temporal resolution are obtained to observe the kinetics of contrast media arrival and clearance through the tumor microcirculation and adjacent tissues. The contrast agent enhancement pattern enables visualization, characterization, and quantification of lesion microcirculation ( ). DCE-MRI parameters allowed the prediction of response to therapy in some cases ( ); however, not all tumors have shown strong correlations between their DCE-MRI patterns and their angiogenic expression.

By choosing different fix thresholds, the tumors are presented homogeneously or heterogeneously. These threshold adaptations are essential for each tumor entity; otherwise, region of interest (ROI) analysis might get misled. (b) A low amplitude (Amp) = 1.0 (a.u.) and k ep = 3.0 min −1 threshold, which is due to overestimation of tumor hot spots. By lowering the threshold for the redistribution rate constant (Amp = 1.3 and k ep = 1.0), the tumor heterogeneity is better represented (c) . Differentiation of other physiologic perfused regions (ie, heart and aorta) is still inappropriately visualized. With additional threshold adaptation of Amp = 2.0 and k ep = 2.3, the MM and its adjunct tissue are best visualized and microcirculatory tumor regions are visible (d) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/PharmacokineticAnalysisofMalignantPleuralMesotheliomaInitialResultsofTumorMicrocirculationanditsCorrelationtoMicrovesselDensityCD34/0_1s20S1076633207007179.jpg)
