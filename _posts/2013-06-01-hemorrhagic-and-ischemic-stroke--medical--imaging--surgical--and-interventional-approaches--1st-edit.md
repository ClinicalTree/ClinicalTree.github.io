_Hemorrhagic and Ischemic Stroke_ by Bendok et al is an evidence-based, multispecialty review of stroke that will transform the radiologist into a more relevant part of the clinical team. The most striking feature of this book is how thoroughly the authors cite the literature to support the content. Where appropriate, they also refer to management decisions at their institutions. The radiologist who opens this book will find an organized text with superb illustrations that seamlessly blend with the text to improve retention of the material.

The book is divided into four sections: “Medical and Critical Care Considerations,” “Imaging Considerations,” “Open Surgical Approaches,” and “Neurointerventional Approaches.” There are between 6 and 17 chapters within each section, for a total of 40 chapters in the book. The primary authors are two neurosurgeons, a neuroradiologist, and a neurologist. This diversity is a benefit that provides the reader with a multidisciplinary perspective that is not present in many pure radiology tomes. There is online content that comes free with the book, including videos of interventions.

This book is not a dedicated radiology textbook. In other words, radiology residents rationing their hours prior to board examinations might consider selecting a different book. On the other hand, the 114-page radiology section is very well written and is a relatively quick read. The section is divided by modality, with comprehensive reviews of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), nuclear medicine, ultrasound, and conventional angiography applications in hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, including all of its causes. The MRI chapter features a brief physics review, including a refreshingly clear explanation of diffusion imaging.

The sections on surgical and neurointerventional approaches include further radiology imaging, ample diagrams, and online videos. Example topics of the 28 chapters in these two sections include topics on bypass, carotid endarterectomy, carotid stenting, and aneurysm coiling. Chapters are typically subdivided into epidemiology, patient and lesion selection, technique, and complications. Again, every statement is followed by discussion of the relevant literature. The two chapters on dural arteriovenous fistulas deserve special mention for reducing an often-confusing topic into clear explanations and diagrams.

_Hemorrhagic and Ischemic Stroke_ provides a data-driven summary of the most current epidemiology, diagnosis, and surgical and interventional management of stroke. The diagnostic radiologist will be empowered to compose relevant interpretations and recommendations, while the neurointerventionalist will acquire updated perspective of the available endovascular and surgical options and the current evidence supporting each.
