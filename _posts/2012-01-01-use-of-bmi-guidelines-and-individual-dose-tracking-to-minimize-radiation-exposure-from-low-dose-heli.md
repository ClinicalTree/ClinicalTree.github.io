## Rationale and Objectives

The increasing use of computed tomography (CT) has been accompanied by rising concerns over potential radiation-related health risks, especially cancer, and a need to minimize such risks.

## Materials and Methods

We conducted 2186 low-dose helical chest CT scans among 1235 nuclear weapons workers at elevated risk of lung cancer, setting the CT scanner tube current at 30 mAs for all participants with BMI <35 kg/m  2 and permitting technologists to raise mAs levels for participants with BMI ≥35 kg/m  2 . Dose-length product (DLP) was recorded from the CT scanner, permitting calculation of effective dose. Phantom-based estimates of effective dose were also made. A chest radiologist recorded acceptability of image quality.

## Results

The study population was significantly overweight: 79% exceeded a body mass index (BMI) >25 kg/m  2 and 37.1% exceeded a BMI ≥30 kg/m  2 . Nearly 90% of CT scans were performed using a tube current setting of 30 mAs and had a mean DLP-based effective dose of 1.3 mSv. The phantom-based estimate of effective dose was lower at 1.1 mSv. Among participants with a BMI ≥35 kg/m  2 , 92% were scanned at 40 or 50 mAs, which was associated with a DLP-based effective dose of 1.6 and 2.0 mSv, respectively. Image quality was satisfactory in 99.8% of scans.

## Conclusion

Application of simple BMI-based guidelines and DLP tracking of low-dose helical chest CT scans in a lung cancer screening program minimizes radiation dose, even in a largely overweight population.

The use of computed tomography (CT) has increased sharply in the past two decades . Rapid technological advancements in CT scanner technology have led to shorter acquisition times, more user-friendly handling, and the ability to reconstruct high quality three-dimensional images of internal body structures.

Concomitantly, rising concern over potential radiation-related cancer risk has made the frequency and circumstances of CT scanner use the focus of a larger public health debate . Recent studies have described incidents of grossly excessive and variable radiation exposure associated with the use of diagnostic CT scans . Other studies have provided estimates of excess cancer deaths after CT scans .
