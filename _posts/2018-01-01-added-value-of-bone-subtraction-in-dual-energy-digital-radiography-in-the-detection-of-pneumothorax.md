## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to determine the value of dual-energy thoracic radiography in the diagnosis of pneumothorax considering the reader's experience.

## Materials and Methods

Forty patients with a suspected pneumothorax, imaged with dual-energy chest radiographs, were divided into two groups: those with pneumothorax as the final diagnosis ( _n_ = 19) and those without ( _n_ = 21). The images were analyzed by 36 readers (5 interns, 16 residents, 15 senior physicians) for the presence or absence of pneumothorax during three readout sessions at 2-week intervals: standard images alone (session 1), dual-energy images with bone subtraction alone (session 2), and a combination of the two (session 3).

## Results

The number of correct responses increased 13.3% between sessions 1 and 2 ( _P_ < .001) and 9.4% between sessions 1 and 3 ( _P_ < .001). The mean sensitivity for pneumothorax detection was higher in sessions 2 (82%) and 3 (79%) compared to session 1 (70%). There was no statistically significant difference in specificity between the sessions. The number of correct responses for small volume pneumothoraces was higher in sessions 2 (10.6 ± 1.8) and 3 (10.1 ± 2.0) than in session 1 (8.9 ± 2.3), with a statistically significant difference between sessions 1 and 2 ( _P_ = .002) and between sessions 1 and 3 ( _P_ = .048).

## Conclusion

Bone subtracted dual-energy thoracic radiographs improve the detection sensitivity of pneumothorax, including in cases of small pneumothoraces, regardless of the reader's level or expertise.

## Introduction

Pneumothorax is a common condition, affecting an estimated 17 of 100,000 people in France and 34.8/100,000 in England . It requires precise and rapid diagnosis, and conventional radiography is usually the initial imaging method of choice. However, pneumothorax detection, particularly in cases of small pneumothoraces, may be difficult and sometimes requires the use of additional techniques, such as computed tomography (CT).

Dual-energy radiography is an expanding technique, thanks to an increase in the availability of flat panel detectors. Diagnostic improvement offered by this technique has been demonstrated in the detection of calcified and noncalcified lung nodules, and calcified thoracic lesions (mediastinal, pleural, or pulmonary) . Although no studies could be found in the literature analyzing the contribution of dual-energy digital radiography for the detection of pneumothorax, it seems that diagnostic performance could be improved by this technique because it can suppress bone structures of the thoracic wall, reducing superimposition and allowing a finer delimitation of lung contours.

Three interpleural distances are measured: the first at the apex of the lung ( a ); the second at the midpoint of the upper half of the thorax ( b ); the third at the midpoint of the lower half of the thorax ( c ). From these three measurements an estimate of the volume of the pneumothorax in percentage is obtained by the formula: 4 + 9 ((a + b + c)/3). Here, a = 1.7 cm; b = 1.3 cm, c = 0.6 cm, that is, 4 + 9 ((1.7 + 1.3 + 0.6)/3) = 14.8%; this a small pneumothorax.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AddedValueofBoneSubtractioninDualenergyDigitalRadiographyintheDetectionofPneumothorax/0_1s20S1076633217303069.jpg)

![Figure 3, Conventional ( a ) and DEBS ( b ) chest radiographs of a 42-year-old man with a small, right apical pneumothorax confirmed surgically. Although a pneumothorax can be seen in both radiographs (arrows), this anomaly is much easier to identify with DEBS ( b ). Note the existence of an artifactual hyperluscent band ty surrounding the cardiac silhouette (arrowheads) in no way hampering pneumothorax identification.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AddedValueofBoneSubtractioninDualenergyDigitalRadiographyintheDetectionofPneumothorax/2_1s20S1076633217303069.jpg)
