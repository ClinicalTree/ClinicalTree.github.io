## Rationale and Objectives

To demonstrate the correlation of proinflammatory cytokines (PCs), intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in CSF of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and also to look for the changes in imaging parameters after antitubercular treatment (ATT) in these patients.

## Materials and Methods

Forty patients with TBM (median age, 27.7 years) and 30 age-/sex-matched controls were included in this study. PCs were quantified from the CSF of TBM patients at the time of hospital admission (baseline). MRI including DTI was performed at the time of baseline study and 6 months after ATT.

## Results

Significant positive correlation of PCs with fractional anisotropy (FA) values and post-contrast signal intensity (PCSI) collected from cerebral cortical regions was observed in TBM patients. A significant positive correlation of FA values with PCSI was also observed at both time points in patient groups. At baseline study significantly high FA values were observed in patients compared to controls. Significantly decreased FA values and PCSI were observed in the patients after 6 months of ATT compared to the baseline study.

## Conclusions

Results of this study suggest that the DTI-derived anisotropy have the potential to delineate meningeal inflammation and it may be used in assessment of therapeutic response in TBM patients as an additional method to conventional imaging.

Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating form of tuberculosis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality worldwide . Its prevalence is increasing globally and is becoming a major problem in the Western world because of the increasing number of immunocompromised and to multidrug-resistant patients with tuberculosis TBM is fatal in 25% of adults and causes neurological sequelae in 25% of survivors even after the administration of modern chemotherapy .

In TBM, bacilli seed to brain parenchyma or meninges to form Rich foci. These foci rupture with release of bacilli in to subarachnoid space and stimulates release of proinflammatory cytokines (PCs) (eg, tumor necrosis factor-α \[TNF-α\], interleukin-1β \[IL-1β\]) and also increases the concentration of white blood cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) . TNF-α has been shown to be associated with the development of TBM pathology in vivo, including tissue necrosis and cachexia . It is produced in response to the bacterial pathogen and mediates the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as selectins, intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs), and vascular cell adhesion molecules . IL-1β and TNF-α, are also responsible for the development of granuloma in TBM patients . In experimental bacterial meningitis, TNF-α has been shown to be responsible for the blood-brain barrier permeability as well as leukocytosis . Tsenova et al observed that TNF-α promote the progression of TBM in murine model .
