## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to evaluate the performances of two iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms and of filtered back projection (FBP) when using reduced-dose chest computed tomography (RDCT) compared to standard-of-care CT.

## Materials and Methods

An institutional review board approval was obtained. Thirty-six patients with hematologic malignancies referred for a control chest CT of a known lung disease were prospectively enrolled. Patients underwent standard-of-care scan reconstructed with hybrid IR, followed by an RDCT reconstructed with FBP, hybrid IR, and iterative model reconstruction. Objective and subjective quality measurements, lesion detectability, and evolution assessment on RDCT were recorded.

## Results

For RDCT, the CTDIvol (volumetric computed tomography dose index) was 0.43 mGy⋅cm for all patients, and the median \[interquartile range\] effective dose was 0.22 mSv \[0.22–0.24\]; corresponding measurements for standard-of-care scan were 3.4 mGy \[3.1–3.9\] and 1.8 mSv \[1.6–2.0\]. Noise significantly decreased from FBP to hybrid IR and from hybrid IR to iterative model reconstruction on RDCT, whereas lesion conspicuity and diagnostic confidence increased. Accurate evolution assessment was obtained in all cases with IR. Emphysema identification was higher with iterative model reconstruction.

## Conclusion

Although iterative model reconstruction offered better diagnostic confidence and emphysema detection, both IR algorithms allowed an accurate evolution assessment with an effective dose of 0.22 mSv.

## Introduction

Over the past decades, the average annual radiation dose delivered has raised significantly worldwide . Reducing computed tomography (CT) radiation dose has become a major concern because of the potential risk of radiation-induced cancer .

Various strategies have been developed to reduce radiation exposure while maintaining image quality, including tube potential selection and tube current modulation. Unfortunately, radiation dose decrease is limited when using filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction. FBP assumes that each pixel value perfectly represents the attenuation of the object at this location, setting aside system hardware details and photon noise statistic information . Because of those idealized assumptions, a lowered radiation dose is accompanied by an increased noise and often increased artifacts.
