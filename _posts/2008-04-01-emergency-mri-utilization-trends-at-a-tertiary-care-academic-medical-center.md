## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluates utilization trends of emergency department (ED)-ordered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations in an adult academic medical center over a 5-year period (2001–2005).

## Materials and Methods

MRI examinations from the ED-ordering location were identified by searching the radiology information system (RIS). Overall MRI volume and ED patient encounters were also assessed during the same period. Each examination was assessed by type of examination, examination completion time, and primary and secondary clinical indications by reviewing the RIS and medical record.

## Results

During the study period, 1,900 ED-ordered MRI examinations were performed on 1,020 patients. During the same period, 62,823 total MRI examinations were performed, and the total ED patient volume was 420,840. ED-ordered MRI volume increased 391% over the study period (125 to 614 examinations/year), whereas total MRI volume increased only 38.9% and ED patient volume in our institution actually decreased by −9%. MRI examinations of the brain, magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck, and spinal MRI were the most commonly ordered tests. Clinical indications were analyzed. Peak times of ED-ordered examination completion were between 4:00 PM and 11:00 PM. A total of 15.5% of examinations required overtime or callback of MRI technologists for completion.

## Conclusions

Multiple reasons are suggested that may increase utilization (perceived need for diagnostic certainty, as well as medico-legal and patient-driven factors). Whether this increase in MRI utilization resulted in improved patient outcomes is unclear and should be studied further. Implications for radiologist coverage and resident training are discussed.

In the United States, the total volume of imaging studies continues to increase ( ). The volume, relative value units (RVU), and RVU per case-mix-adjusted admission of cross-sectional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography, has particularly increased ( ). In the emergency department (ED) setting, previous studies have assessed utilization trends of computed tomographic (CT) imaging and found significant increases over the past 5 years ( ). Increasing medical costs related to imaging can be significant ( ). Concerns regarding radiation exposure have prompted more detailed assessment of CT utilization, especially in the pediatric population ( ). Although less commonly obtained as an emergency study, we have noticed a trend of increased utilization of MR studies in the ED in our institution. MRI is a highly useful imaging modality for a wide variety of clinical indications and provides unique information that can clearly affect patient care. Although radiation exposure concerns are not an issue with MRI, the more limited availability of MRI, difficulty in scheduling MRI examinations at some institutions, less experience of residents with MRI interpretation, and potential for significant impact of emergency/unscheduled MRI examinations on radiologist and technologist staffing prompted our evaluation of MRI performance. We could find no previous study assessing overall MRI utilization in the ED setting. Baseline information is necessary to begin to evaluate potential areas of overuse, define examinations that are high yield for clinically important findings, provide a framework for resident instruction in commonly performed examinations and indications, and address staffing changes potentially made necessary by changes in utilization.

## Materials and Methods

Emergency MRI exams were identified by electronically searching the radiology information system (Quadris, Cerner Corp, Kansas City, MO) for ED-ordering location between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005. These included examinations ordered while the patient was in the emergency room. The patient may have been subsequently admitted before examination performance; however, this identified examinations that were unscheduled requiring emergent interpretation, thus exhibiting maximum impact on the imaging department. Examinations were grouped by type of examination, time of examination order, time of examination completion, date, and clinical indication. Clinical indications were identified by searching the medical record and ordering indication and described as primary and secondary. The primary indication is the main reason given for the ordering the examination. The secondary indication could include other related indications. An example indication for a brain MRI would be “mental status change, assess for intracranial mass.” The primary indication would be “mental status change” and the secondary “possible intracranial mass.” These indications were combined for analysis to give a more complete picture of the clinical scenario of each examination, and were grouped into standard categories. The total number of MRI examinations and ED visits was also obtained and compared with the ED-ordering location MRI volume. Ordering physicians included ED physicians and clinical house staff primarily from the neurosurgery, neurology, and surgical departments.
