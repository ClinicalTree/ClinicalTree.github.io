## Rationale and Objectives

In current practice, radiologists interpret digital images, including a substantial amount of volumetric images. We hypothesized that interpretation of a stack of a volumetric data set demands different skills than interpretation of two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional images. This study aimed to investigate and compare knowledge and skills used for interpretation of volumetric versus 2D images.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty radiology clerks were asked to think out loud while reading four or five volumetric computed tomography (CT) images in stack mode and four or five 2D CT images. Cases were presented in a digital testing program allowing stack viewing of volumetric data sets and changing views and window settings. Thoughts verbalized by the participants were registered and coded by a framework of knowledge and skills concerning three components: perception, analysis, and synthesis. The components were subdivided into 16 discrete knowledge and skill elements. A within-subject analysis was performed to compare cognitive processes during volumetric image readings versus 2D cross-sectional image readings.

## Results

Most utterances contained knowledge and skills concerning perception (46%). A smaller part involved synthesis (31%) and analysis (23%). More utterances regarded perception in volumetric image interpretation than in 2D image interpretation (Median 48% vs 35%; z = −3.9; _P_ < .001). Synthesis was less prominent in volumetric than in 2D image interpretation (Median 28% vs 42%; z = −3.9; _P_ < .001). No differences were found in analysis utterances.

## Conclusions

Cognitive processes in volumetric and 2D cross-sectional image interpretation differ substantially. Volumetric image interpretation draws predominantly on perceptual processes, whereas 2D image interpretation is mainly characterized by synthesis. The results encourage the use of volumetric images for teaching and testing perceptual skills.

## Introduction

The daily practice of radiologists has changed since the introduction of cross-sectional imaging techniques (eg, computed tomography \[CT\] and magnetic resonance imaging) and digital viewing systems . Digital volumetric data sets have been introduced, which can be scrolled through in different planes and window settings. Volumetric image sets are increasingly used because this is advantageous for identification and analysis of radiologic abnormalities . We expect that the interpretation of stacks of volumetric data sets demands different skills than interpretation of two-dimensional (2D) images . For example, visual search patterns in stack mode viewing of CT images differ from tiled mode viewing . Drew et al. found that the pattern of errors made in volumetric CT image interpretation differs from error patterns in interpretation of 2D images, which were chest x-rays in this case, as decision errors are less common in CT image interpretation . In volumetric image interpretation, radiologists need to navigate through and manipulate images to identify and analyze lesions. Although the multidimensional information enables a radiologist to observe the image features in detail, this requires the processing of much more information which could make the radiologist's search more complex and time consuming .

As radiology practice has changed, and cognitive processes in image interpretation may have consequently altered, traditional 2D teaching methods may not align well with the knowledge and skills required for current practice . To gain insight in image interpretation skills for educational purposes, it is useful to explore which cognitive processes occur in volumetric image interpretation and how these differ from 2D image interpretation.

I think there is._ ” (analysis, spleen laceration) Spatial abilities  †  — Image manipulation skills (navigating through, changing views or contrast) “ _I always count vertebral bodies in the sagittal view._ ” (perception, Jefferson fracture) Acquaintance of clinical information and context “I see a large hypodense area in the right hemisphere. _This corresponds to the hemiparesis at the left._ ” (analysis, brain infarction) Perception Using efficient search strategies “I _try to divide the head in three parts.

Where does it start, before or behind the vessels? No behind, _so it is type B._ ” (aortic dissection) Deciding about advice or action “Cerebral herniation…if I was a radiology resident, _I would have warned them that they should pay attention to that._ ” (epidural hematoma)
