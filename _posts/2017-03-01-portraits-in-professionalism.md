To excel as a radiologist, it is not always sufficient to be merely a radiologist. Case in point: John A. “Jack” Campbell, MD, the long-time chair of radiology at Indiana University. Although a dedicated leader who helped to build a large academic radiology department almost from scratch, Campbell was also a physician with a conscience, who believed that radiologists have a responsibility to make a difference in their communities. As a leader, he sought not only to promote quality and productivity, but also to serve larger ethical and political ends. By getting to know the stories of individuals like Campbell, younger radiologists can gain a clearer appreciation of the vital role that a person's character plays in making a good radiologist.

Of Scottish descent, Campbell's father had been born on a farm but ended up studying chemistry at the University of Michigan. He subsequently took a job with Procter and Gamble, where he developed synthetic scents for soaps and a method of flaking soap for laundry use. Jack Campbell was born in Cincinnati in 1914. By attending school year-round, he received his undergraduate degree in just 2 years, followed by his medical degree in 1937, both from the University of Cincinnati, where he was elected to membership in Alpha Omega Alpha. He then completed an internship at Detroit Receiving Hospital, then a 3-year radiology residency at Henry Ford Hospital. This was followed by a 6-month neuroradiology fellowship at Michigan.

Campbell then moved to Indiana in 1941, where he was appointed as a full-time instructor in radiology, soon assuming responsibility for pediatric radiology. His annual salary was $2400. In 1943, he became chief of radiology at the local county hospital. At the conclusion of World War II, he began receiving many requests for radiology training from military physicians, so he started a 3-year radiology residency program. In 1947, a new department of radiology at Indiana University was founded, and Campbell served as the director of hospital services. Eventually, Campbell was appointed chair of radiology. In 1971, Campbell moved to Los Angeles to become the first chair of radiology at the new Drew Postgraduate Medical School and chief of radiology at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital.

When Campbell was a senior in college, he met a high school senior named Willie Grace. The two began dating, and in 1937 she graduated from college and he from medical school. They married a year later, Campbell having chosen Ford for his residency because it paid a sufficient amount to support a spouse. Jack was from a Presbyterian background and Willie was Episcopalian, but they decided to join a Unitarian church. Once they reached Indianapolis, they were active in the American Civil Liberties Union, and they were so frustrated with Indianapolis's conservative local newspaper that they received their news a day late through the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
