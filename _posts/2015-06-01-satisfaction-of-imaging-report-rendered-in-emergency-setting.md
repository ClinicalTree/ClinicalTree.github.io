## Rationale and Objectives

To determine physicians' preference toward three types of structured imaging reports (basic structured report \[BSR\], itemized report \[IR\], and point-and-click report \[PCR\]) used in emergency radiology.

## Materials and Methods

Survey questions were created and considered valid and reliable based on index of item objective congruence from three specialists (>0.75) and a pilot of 25 subjects (Cronbach alpha, 0.83–1.00). Respondents included trainees and attendings in radiology and referring physicians working in the academic emergency department at the time of survey rollout. They were provided report examples of each type and asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of the following five parts: demographics, necessity of imaging report, report quality (content, format and organization, and language), process of reporting, and components of imaging report. For rating scores, the higher value means the higher preference and agreement.

## Results

The survey received 79.5% response rate. Respondents included 101 physicians (mean age, 29.4 years; 61 radiology physicians and 40 referring physicians; 81 trainees and 20 attending). Overall, IR was preferred over PCR and BSR by all physicians with scores (out of 10) as follows: IR, 7.62–8.83; PCR, 6.62–8.55; BSR, 5.23–6.65; _P_ < .001\. IR received scores (out of 5) of 4.03–4.37, PCR 3.32–4.52, and BSR 2.59–3.86 for report quality. For process of reporting, IR had scores (out of 5) of 3.80–4.56, PCR 2.79–4.09, and BSR 2.32–3.56.

## Conclusions

In emergency setting, physicians preferred IR over PCR and BSR. IR and PCR were equal in report quality metrics, but IR was most preferred in the process of reporting. BSR ranked last in both quality and process.

The imaging report is a dominant communication method between radiologists and referring physicians. It helps guide patient care by providing diagnostic information for decision making and reference for further investigations . Quality clinical care provided through the use of imaging reports depends on the reports' timeliness and accuracy as much as their clarity and consistency. The need for clarity and consistency of imaging reports is a major drive for the radiology practice to change from conventional free-text reporting to structured reporting pattern . All structured reports share three essential attributes: structured format, consistent organization, and standard language . Being structurally formatted with consistent organization and standard language, structured reports are believed to be easier to use, read, and understand by both radiology and referring physicians . Several surveys show a strong preference for these types of reports .

There are three main variations of structured reports: basic structured report (BSR), itemized report (IR), and point-and-click report (PCR). BSR is the rudimentary one consisting only of basic headings such as examination type, clinical information, findings, and conclusion. IR is developed from BSR by adding subheadings under sections. PCR was introduced along with the development of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System . In PCR, clickable options of standardized texts are added underneath headings and subheadings. This allows the radiologist to point (with a computer mouse) and click on provided checkboxes or drop-down lists of options, instead of having to dictate or type texts. PCR potentially allows more standardized report format, content, language, and improved report clarity and consistency. In 2008, the Radiological Society of North America's (RSNA) reporting committee initiated a project to create and share PCR templates on the Web site,  radreports.org . They believe that these report templates represent best practices that can be adjusted and adopted based on local preferences. However, there are still many controversies on suitability and likeability of different forms of structured report in different imaging settings .

Examples of Three Types of Structured Report


Type Report Basic structured report Ultrasound of the upper abdomen

History: A 43-year-old woman presented with acute right upper quadrant pain for 2 days. She was sent to rule out acute cholecystitis.

Comparison: None.

Findings:

The study reveals normal size and diffuse increased parenchymal echopattern of the liver. There is no space-occupying lesion. No biliary ductal dilatation is seen. The CBD is not dilated, measuring about 0.4 cm in diameter. The gallbladder is distended with wall thickening, measuring about 4 mm in thickness. Multiple gallstones at gallbladder neck with bile sludge, measured about 1.6–2.0 cm in size. Sonographic Murphy's sign is positive. No pericholecystic fluid is detected.

The pancreas appears unremarkable. The spleen is of prominent size without focal lesion.

The right and left kidneys are normal in size and parenchymal echopattern, measuring about 4.3 × 10.8 cm and 4.3 × 9.3 cm in size, respectively. There is no renal stone or cyst. No hydronephrosis is detected.

No free fluid is seen.
