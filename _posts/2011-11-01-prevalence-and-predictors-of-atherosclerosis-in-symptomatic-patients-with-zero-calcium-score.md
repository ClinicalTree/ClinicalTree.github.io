## Rationale and Objectives

Absence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in symptomatic patients is associated with a very low risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However, patients with zero CAC may have noncalcified plaques (NCP). In this analysis, we sought to determine the prevalence and predictors of NCP in symptomatic patients with zero CAC.

## Materials and Methods

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) was performed in 333 consecutive symptomatic patients (mean age 50 ± 12, 65% males) with zero CAC and no known coronary artery disease (CAD). Pretest likelihood was estimated by Framingham risk score (FRS). Independent predictors of NCP were identified using multivariate logistic regression.

## Results

NCP was detected in 55 patients (17%) on CCTA, of which 6 patients (1.8%) had significant stenosis. In univariate analysis, patients with NCP were older (55 ± 7 vs. 50 ± 10 years, _P_ = .009), with higher prevalence of hypertension (80% vs. 63%, _P_ = .013). Using multivariate logistic regression, the independent predictors of NCP in this cohort were intermediate to high FRS (OR 2.3, 95%CI 1.3–4.1, _P_ = .007), whereas baseline statin therapy was associated with lower prevalence of NCP (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.17–0.89, _P_ = .02).

## Conclusion

Our analysis shows that nearly one in five patients with zero calcium score has NCP and one in three patients with zero calcium score and intermediate to high FRS have evidence of NCP on CCTA. The prognostic value of NCP in these patients needs further evaluation.

The role of coronary artery calcium (CAC) measurement in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) has undergone extensive evaluation in the last two decades. Absence of CAC is associated with a low prevalence of obstructive CAD and adverse cardiovascular events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients . Therefore, CAC measurement has been proposed as a “gatekeeper” for further invasive and noninvasive diagnostic testing for CAD .

In addition, The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology expert consensus document proposed that zero CAC can be used as an effective filter before performing further diagnostic testing . CAC does not detect noncalcified plaques (NCP) that at times could cause significant stenosis . Identifying symptomatic patients with zero CAC with high likelihood of NCP may affect their management because these patients may benefit from antiatherosclerotic therapies. Also, it might preclude the need for unwarranted testing in a large number of low-risk patients preventing possible procedural complications, radiation, and contrast hazards conferred by various coronary diagnostic modalities. The prevalence of NCP in patients with zero calcium score has been very variable in the literature (ranges from 1% to 39% in different series) . Moreover, there are conflicting data regarding predictors of NCP in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients without coronary calcification .
