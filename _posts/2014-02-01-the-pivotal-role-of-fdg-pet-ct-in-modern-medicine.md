The technology behind positron emission tomography (PET) and the most widely used tracer, 2-deoxy-2-\[18F\]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), were both conceived in the 1970s, but the latest decade has witnessed a rapid emergence of FDG-PET as an effective imaging technique. This is not least due to the emergence of hybrid scanners combining PET with computed tomography (PET/CT). Molecular imaging has enormous potential for advancing biological research and patient care, and FDG-PET/CT is currently the most widely used technology in this domain. In this review, we discuss contemporary applications of FDG-PET and FDG-PET/CT as well as novel developments in quantification and potential future indications including the emerging new modality PET/magnetic resonance imaging.

Although the technology behind positron emission tomography (PET) and the most widely used tracer, 2-deoxy-2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG), were both conceived in the 1970s (  Figure 1 ) , the latest decade has witnessed a rapid emergence of FDG-PET as an effective imaging technique. This is not least due to the appearance of hybrid scanners combining PET with computed tomography (PET/CT), the gradual approval of these novel techniques by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and subsequent reimbursement coverage by the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States. Molecular imaging has enormous potential for advancing biological research and patient care, and FDG-PET/CT is currently the most widely used technology in this domain.

Glucose and glucose analogs enter any cell via a family of ubiquitous transmembrane transporters called glucose transporters (GLUTs). On entry into the cell, they can produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate by way of the glycolytic pathway regardless of the presence of molecular oxygen in the cell . Many malignant cells are hypermetabolic and highly glycolytic, a knowledge dating back to the 1930s when Warburg demonstrated increased glucose metabolism in malignant cells in vitro . To facilitate this high level of glycolysis, many different cancer cells have been shown to be characterized by an upregulation of GLUT and an increased expression of glycolytic enzymes and hexokinase activity, although not ubiquitously present in all cancers . The transport of glucose into cells is facilitated by a downhill gradient maintained by the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinases. This mechanism also applies to FDG, which is converted to FDG-6-phosphate once it enters the cell. However, because of a subtle, but significant, stereochemical difference, FDG-6-phosphate is not a substrate for further metabolism in the glycolytic pathway. Neither glucose-6-phosphate nor FDG-6-phosphate can leave the cell by way of GLUT. Instead, the effect of hexokinase is reversed by glucose-6-phosphatase, which dephosphorylates glucose or FDG, enabling it to leave the cell. However, tumor cells contain low levels of glucose-6-phosphatase to counteract hexokinases, and as such, FDG-6-phosphate is metabolically trapped inside the cell. Combined with the increased rates of glycolysis, the result is a net accumulation of FDG in many malignant cells relative to normal cells, making FDG an excellent and sensitive marker for changes in glucose metabolism . The degree of FDG retention is dictated by the concentration and degree of activity of glucose-6-phosphatase. This is important because these factors may vary considerably between highly differentiated and undifferentiated tumor cells, which will result in producing varying degrees of uptake and retention profiles over time for this tracer. There are also differences in the enzyme concentration and enzyme activity in benign and malignant diseases with a more rapid cellular washout of FDG in normal tissues and in benign disorders because of higher levels of glucose-6-phosphatase . This observation may be used advantageously to differentiate between benign inflammatory cells and malignant ones. This can be achieved by multiple time point imaging, which will reveal different uptake patterns over time between the two scans. Delayed imaging can also be of great value for visualizing highly differentiated cancers, which may have limited FDG avidity initially but become positive during later scans.

FDG-PET and FDG-PET/CT are not without limitations. Stand-alone PET lacks spatial resolution and anatomic correlation, but this is alleviated by the hybrid PET/CT technology. Furthermore, FDG is a nonspecific tracer. This is especially challenging in the overall differentiating between the main clinical indications, malignancies and inflammatory conditions, but also within these disease entities, there may be issues caused by the nonspecific changes in uptake following instrumentation, surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, there are also intrinsic factors affecting the specificity. First, GLUT transporters are ubiquitous, and physiologic uptake may be present in many organs or tissues using glucose, and thus, there are many potential sites of nonspecific physiologic FDG uptake, most notably muscles, brain, and heart. FDG is excreted through urine, which may hamper the assessment of the urinary tract. FDG is also excreted to the bowel, and furthermore, the normal bacterial flora uses glucose to some extent, which may give rise to both focal and diffuse uptake in the bowel. Some advocate catheter a demeure and bowel cleansing, but there is no consensus on the routine use. Finally, FDG competes with glucose and thus the net FDG uptake in pathologic processes depends on blood glucose levels .

With this in mind, some basic considerations in patient preparation before FDG injection should be considered. Skeletal muscle is by far the largest organ structure and accounts for the majority of glucose metabolism in healthy human beings. Therefore, it also has the largest FDG uptake capacity . The degree of physiologic FDG uptake should therefore be decreased as much as possible to minimize any detrimental effect on target-to-background contrast, which may hamper the detection of pathologically FDG-avid lesions. This is accomplished by fasting for at least 4–6 hours before FDG injection, avoiding exercise, and resting during the uptake period .

The plasma glucose level in patients should also be normal before the administration of FDG. Skeletal muscles mostly take up FDG by insulin stimulation of GLUT, and euglycemic hyperinsulinemia has been shown experimentally to cause increased FDG uptake in muscles with no effect on malignant cells . Despite sufficient fasting, chronic hyperglycemia (>200 mg/dL \[∼11 mmol/L\]) is not uncommon as it occurs often in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, this has been shown to have minimal effects on the diagnostic performance of FDG-PET with no correlation between FDG muscle uptake and plasma glucose level . Therefore, if scans cannot be rescheduled, hyperglycemia is preferable to hyperinsulinemia, and administering insulin before FDG injection should be avoided. Of course, these caveats become even more important if FDG is to be used for assessing the musculoskeletal system, for example, evaluation of potential skeletal metastases.
