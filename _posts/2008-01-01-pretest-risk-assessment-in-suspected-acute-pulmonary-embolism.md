## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the pretest practices of US clinicians who treat patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Materials and Methods

We surveyed 855 practicing physicians selected randomly from three professional organizations. We asked participants to estimate how often and by what method they determine the likelihood of PE before they request confirmatory studies. Participants reported their awareness of four published clinical practice guidelines dealing with acute PE and selected options for further diagnostic testing after reviewing clinical data from three hypothetical patients presenting with low, intermediate, and high probability of acute PE.

## Results

We received completed surveys from 240 physicians practicing in 44 states. Although most (98.3%) report that they assess pretest probability of PE before testing, slightly more than half do so routinely. A total of 72.5% prefer an unstructured approach to pretest assessment, whereas 22.9% use published prediction rules. Most (93.0%) are aware of at least one published guideline for assessing acute PE, but only 44.2% report using one or more in daily practice. Respondents who use published prediction rules, estimate pretest probability routinely, or use at least one practice guideline were more likely to request additional testing when reviewing a low probability clinical scenario. No differences in testing frequency or preferences were observed for intermediate or high probability clinical scenarios.

## Conclusions

The majority of clinicians we surveyed use an unstructured approach when estimating the pretest probability of acute PE. With the exception of low probability scenario, clinicians agreed on testing choices in suspected acute PE, regardless of the method or frequency of pre-test assessment.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common, potentially lethal, but treatable condition with protean clinical manifestations ( ). Accurate and timely diagnosis of PE is essential because both the over- and undertreatment of acute PE carries significant risk ( ). Because the prevalence of PE in patient populations in whom it is suspected varies widely and may be as low as 18% ( ), the appropriate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging can be challenging. The recent increased use of diagnostic imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography in hospitalized and emergency department patients suggests that clinicians are lowering their threshold for requesting confirmatory radiologic testing in acute PE ( ). A simple and effective means of clinical risk assessment to guide subsequent, expensive diagnostic testing would be useful ( ).

Three models for clinical pretest risk assessment in acute PE have been proposed: the Canadian model of Wells and others ( ), the Geneva model ( ), and the Pisa model ( ). Each of these methods assigns patients to low-, intermediate-, or high-risk categories based on history, clinical findings, and chest radiography. After the PE risk is defined, published practice guidelines can be applied to direct subsequent confirmatory laboratory and radiological testing ( ). Although the utility of such clinical prediction rules in patients with suspected acute PE has been studied and validated ( ), it is not known whether US physicians regularly use them in practice. In the case of PE, physicians may prefer to base pretest assessment on their own unstructured judgment ( ), even though such “gestalt” impressions suffer from inadequate interobserver reliability ( ). In addition, it is not known whether clinicians are aware of and adhere to published guidelines when evaluating patients with suspected acute PE.
