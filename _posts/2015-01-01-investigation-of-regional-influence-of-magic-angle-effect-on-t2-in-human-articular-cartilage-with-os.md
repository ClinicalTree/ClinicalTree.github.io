## Rationale and Objectives

The objectives of this research study were to determine the magic-angle effect on different subregions of in vivo human femoral cartilage through the quantitative assessment of the effect of static magnetic field orientation ( _B_ 0 ) on transverse (T  2 ) relaxation time at 3.0 T.

## Materials and Methods

Healthy volunteers ( _n_ = 5; mean age, 36.4 years) and clinical patients ( _n_ = 5; mean age, 64 years) with early osteoarthritis (OA) were scanned at 3.0-T magnetic resonance using an 8-channel phased-array knee coil (transmit-receive).

## Results

The T  2 maps revealed significantly greater values in anterior than in posterior regions. When the cartilage regions were oriented at 55° to _B_ 0 (magic angle), the longest T  2 values were detected in comparison with the neighboring regions oriented 90° and 180° (0°) to _B_ 0 . The subregions oriented 180° (0°) to _B_ 0 showed the lowest T  2 values.

## Conclusions

The differences in T  2 values of different subregions suggest that magic-angle effect needs to be considered when interpreting cartilage abnormalities in OA patients.

The primary macromolecules in human cartilage are collagen type II and proteoglycans. Proteoglycan is responsible for much of the compressive stiffness through electrostatic repulsion, whereas collagen provides the tensile and shear strength . The earliest biochemical changes in osteoarthritis (OA) are the modifications at the molecular level of cartilage matrix, which occur without obvious morphologic changes. The loss of glycosaminoglycan and the collagen breakdown are the typical characteristics of early OA .

Human articular cartilage is a highly ordered and depth-dependent ultrastructure and is essentially defined by the organization of the collagen fibrils . Collagen fibers in histology have three predominant organizational zones across the depth of the cartilage tissue. In the superficial (tangential) zone, the collagen fabrils are parallel to the cartilage surface, whereas in the radial (deep) zone, the fabrils are oriented perpendicular to the surface. However, in the transitional (middle/intermediate) zone, the arrangement of collagen fibers is almost random. The characteristic arrangement of collagen fibers results in the “magic-angle effect” and exhibits anisotropic properties when measured at different tissue depths and from different physical orientations in the proton magnetic resonance (MR) images .
