## Rationale and Objectives

Acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV) shows promise for spatial control and acceleration of thermal lesion production. The investigators hypothesized that microbubbles generated by ADV could enhance high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) thermal ablation by controlling and increasing local energy absorption.

## Materials and Methods

Thermal lesions were produced in tissue-mimicking phantoms using focused ultrasound (1.44 MHz) with a focal intensity of 4000 W · cm  −2 in degassed water at 37°C. The average lesion volume was measured by visible change in optical opacity and by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, in vivo HIFU lesions were generated in a canine liver before and after an intravenous injection of droplets with a similar acoustic setup.

## Results

Thermal lesions were sevenfold larger in phantoms containing droplets (3 × 10  5 droplets/mL) compared to phantoms without droplets. The mean lesion volume with a 2-second HIFU exposure in droplet-containing phantoms was comparable to that made by a 5-second exposure in phantoms without droplets. In the in vivo study, the average lesion volumes without and with droplets were 0.017 ± 0.006 cm  3 (n = 4; 5-second exposure) and 0.265 ± 0.005 cm  3 (n = 3; 5-second exposure), respectively, a factor of 15 difference. The shape of ADV bubbles imaged with B-mode ultrasound was very similar to the actual lesion shape as measured optically and by magnetic resonance imaging.

## Conclusion

ADV bubbles may facilitate clinical HIFU ablation by reducing treatment time or requisite in situ total acoustic power and provide ultrasonic imaging feedback of the thermal therapy.

Each year, >500,000 new cases of liver cancer are diagnosed worldwide, and the incidence is continuously increasing in the United States . Although surgical resection and liver transplantation are curative , only 20% to 30% of patients are suitable for surgery, because of contraindications and a limited number of donors . Overall, the 5-year survival rates of liver cancer are <10% . For these reasons, minimally invasive thermal therapies, including radiofrequency ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) have been developed and are currently being used or evaluated for the treatment of liver masses. HIFU therapy is a noninvasive technique wherein focused ultrasound beams are emitted from a high-powered transducer to thermally ablate a tissue volume inside the body. HIFU systems commonly operate in a frequency range of 1 to 5 MHz, generating high focal intensities up to 30 kW · cm  −2 . Such intensities can increase the tissue temperature beyond 60°C within the focal volume in seconds, resulting in irreversible protein denaturation, cell destruction, and associated coagulative necrosis . Two principal mechanisms, direct absorption of the transmitted pressure wave and acoustic cavitation, may cause tissue heating synergistically . The initial applications of HIFU on biologic tissues were proposed by Lynn et al . Later, Burov suggested using HIFU to treat malignant tumors. The bioeffects and specific properties of focused ultrasound on tissues have been investigated in further studies , and the physical principles associated with HIFU are becoming better understood .

HIFU treatment has distinct advantages over other focal ablative therapies. It is noninvasive and nonionizing. The focused energy is sufficient to induce thermal coagulation in a small volume within seconds, so the blood perfusion effects are minimized . However, a major difficulty has been creating homogenous, reproducible, and uniformly shaped lesions and producing these in such a manner as to treat large volumes at a rate that does not damage overlying tissues but achieves full treatment in a clinically manageable time period.

Comparison of Lesion Volume Measured by MRI and Visible Macroscopic Imaging with 4 Seconds of HIFU Exposure


Droplet Concentration (droplets/mL) MRI Volume (cm  3  ) Optical Volume (cm  3  ) 0 (n = 8) 0.05 ± 0.01 0.04 ± 0.01 10  4  (n = 5) 0.10 ± 0.01 0.12 ± 0.02 10  5  (n = 8) 0.29 ± 0.05 0.30 ± 0.05 10  6  (n = 8) No lesion No lesion

At the concentration of 10  6  droplets/mL, copious acoustic droplet vaporization bubbles were observed, but no lesions were detected by either visible, macroscopic imaging or MRI, possibly because of the backscatter from the high-density acoustic droplet vaporization bubbles advancing the droplet vaporization proximally to shadow the focus.
