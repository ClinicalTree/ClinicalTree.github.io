This book is one of the Expert Radiology Series published by Saunders, with each book aiming to cover a specific subspecialty in radiology. This first edition book serves as an excellent reference to anyone who reads spine imaging in his or her daily practice. This well-organized, comprehensive text has 13 sections addressing specific areas: imaging techniques for the spine, the paraspinal soft tissues, the normal anatomy of the spinal column and cord, normal spinal aging and degeneration, the normal vascularization of the spinal cord, spinal ischemia and vascular malformations, spinal trauma, spinal tumors and cysts, metabolic disorders of the spine, spinal inflammation and infection, and operative considerations of the spine. The last three chapters address the brachial plexus, the sacral plexus, and peripheral nerve compression at the carpal tunnel.

In the age of increasingly sophisticated advancement in spinal imaging techniques, the experts of this book stress the importance of understanding the fundamental anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the spine by providing meticulously labeled pathologic gross (ie, gross anatomy of the dissected spinal cord in Chapter 5 and the anatomic sections of the intervertebral discs in Chapter 6), histologic slides of different disease entities and demonstrating radiology and pathology correlations of the same disease processes, all of which help solidify the concepts that the authors describe superbly in the text.

The authors emphasize the significance of a useful interpretation of spinal imaging and provided detailed magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography sample reports detailing the pertinent positives and negatives that should be discussed, allowing the necessary information be communicated effectively and concisely to clinicians. What good is a report if it is not answering the clinician’s concerns? Sample protocols for spine imaging are provided for the readers’ reference. Key point boxes at the end of each chapter provide essential facts quickly at the reader’s finger tips. Most current literature is cited at the end of each chapter for easy references. Therapeutic options for spinal disease are explored with a dedicated chapter for kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. As a bonus, purchase of this book also provides online access to the fully searchable text at  expertconsult.com with downloadable images.

The image quality of this book is superb and contains more than 1300 images. The intended audience is primarily radiology residents and fellows, although medical students, general practicing radiologists, subspecialists including neuroradiologists, interventional radiologists, and emergency radiologists, along with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons would all benefit from this book. This wonderful concise and thorough text will provide a gateway for those new to spinal imaging as well a quick handy review to all others.
