## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine radiologists' use and perceptions of computer-aided detection (CAD) and double reading for screening mammography interpretation.

## Materials and Methods

A mailed survey of 257 community radiologists participating in the national Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium was used to assess perceptions and practices related to CAD and double reading. Latent class analysis was used to classify radiologists' overall perceptions of CAD and double reading on the basis of their agreement or disagreement with specific statements about CAD and double reading.

## Results

Most radiologists (64%) reported using CAD for more than half the screening mammograms they interpreted, but only <5% reported double reading that much. More radiologists perceived that double reading improved cancer detection rates compared to CAD (74% vs 55% reported), whereas fewer radiologists thought that double reading decreased recall rates compared to CAD (50% vs 65% reported). Radiologists with the most favorable perceptions of CAD were more likely to think that CAD improved cancer detection rates without taking too much time compared to radiologists with the most unfavorable overall perceptions. In latent class analysis, an overall favorable perception of CAD was significantly associated with the use of CAD (81%), a higher percentage of workload in screening mammography (80%), academic affiliation (71%), and fellowship training (58%). Perceptions of double reading that were most favorable were associated with academic affiliation (98%).

## Conclusions

Radiologists' perceptions were more favorable toward double reading by a second clinician than by a computer, although fewer used double reading in their own practice. The majority of radiologists perceived both CAD and double reading at least somewhat favorably, although for largely different reasons.

We have entered a unique period in medicine in which double reading by a computer may soon replace double reading by a second clinician. This is especially prominent in the field of breast imaging. Computer-aided detection (CAD) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in screening mammography interpretation since 1998 with the goal of serving as the equivalent of a “spell checker” to mark potentially abnormal findings and thus lead to improved breast cancer detection . Since that time, the diffusion of CAD in clinical practice has progressed . The use of CAD for screening mammography interpretation has been given some positive anecdotal attention from the commercial media and may have increased patient expectations of accurate cancer detection. However, information on the relative benefits and harms of CAD in mammography is limited and often contradictory. CAD has been shown to increase rates of recall and lower specificity in some studies and to improve sensitivity and cancer detection rates in others .

Double reading is generally accepted as a practice to improve cancer detection in screening mammography, but this is primarily done in Europe and is therefore included in the “European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Breast Cancer Screening and Diagnosis” . Double reading is not consistently practiced in the United States, possibly because it demands more radiologist time without reimbursement for the second read. Furthermore, the benefits of double reading depend on how the information from the second radiologist is obtained and used (eg, whether the second assessment is independent and blinded to that of the first assessment and whether the final medical decision making requires consensus between the two radiologists for recall).
