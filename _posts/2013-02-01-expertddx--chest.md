_EXPERTddx: Chest_ by Stern et al is a first edition in the esteemed _EXPERTddx_ collection published by Amirsys. This book is an excellent comprehensive pictorial guide of chest pathology that comes with an electronic reference Web site supplying an “overabundance” of additional images. The book is presumably primarily intended for radiology residents and chest radiologists, but its ease in readability makes it a great text for pulmonologists and even medical students, in my opinion.

The text is broken down into chapters dedicated to anatomic structures within the chest. As a visual learner, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this text. Where it stands apart to me from most other texts in chest radiology is in the number of images encompassing the vast assortment of disease processes. The average page seemingly has more space occupied with images than with words. Presented with multiple examples of each type of pathology, one can better grasp the imaging appearance of the disease process at hand.

As in other books in this series, each section is divided into a differential diagnosis based on a radiographic finding, which appeals to the systematic learner in me. This allowed me to identify and absorb the subtle findings that separate different conditions radiographically similar to one another, whether because of a subtle imaging difference or history or patient presentation. For example, the chapter on the large airways has a section titled “Tracheal Dilation.” Initially, a differential diagnosis is given for the finding, which is ordered from more common to less common diagnoses. This is followed by a subsection titled “Essential Information,” in which a discussion of the key points for each of the diagnoses in the previously provided differential diagnosis ensues. _EXPERTddx: Chest_ also has a chapter dedicated to differential diagnoses on the basis of symptoms, helping tie in relevant histories we may receive.

I found the concise nature of the text, in “bullet point” format, perfect for a quick review, but I also found that each page is filled with high-yield facts. Given that this text is a first edition, the authors have, I believe, done a fantastic job in illustrating the vast yet exciting array of chest pathology, one that will likely prove challenging to improve upon with subsequent editions. This practical, easy-to-use reference will always have a place on my bookshelf.
