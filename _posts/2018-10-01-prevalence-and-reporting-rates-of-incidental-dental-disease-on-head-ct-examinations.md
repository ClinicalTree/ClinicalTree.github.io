## Rationale and Objectives

Routine head computed tomography (CT) examinations often inadvertently include dental pathology which is often overlooked. The purpose of this study is to examine the prevalence of dental disease incidentally present and detected on head CT examinations, and to determine the effect of the institution of a dental disease field or macro in a standardized head CT dictation template on the rate of reporting dental disease.

## Materials and Methods

Head CT examinations were retrospectively and randomly selected from all examinations performed 6 months before, and 6 months after the institution of a dental disease field in a standardized head CT template. Dental findings were recorded from the initial finalized report. Examination images were subsequently reviewed for the presence of dental disease by two neuroradiologists who were blinded to the original reports and to each other's findings.

## Results

One hundred examinations were reviewed in the analysis. At our institution, 33% of the randomly selected head CT examinations included the level of the teeth (100/307). Dental disease was determined to be present in 40%–41% of these cases. Only 11% of the initial reports mentioned dental disease ( _P_ < .01). Addition of a dental disease field in the dictation template resulted in no significant difference in reporting dental disease (14% vs 8%, _P_ = .371).

## Conclusions

Incidental dental disease is common and frequently underreported. Inclusion of a dental disease field in a standardized template does not significantly improve the rate of reporting dental disease.

## Introduction

Computed tomography (CT) examinations of the head performed for dedicated imaging of the brain and posterior fossa-intracranial structures (referred to as “head CT” herein) are of the most common CT examinations ordered in both the inpatient and outpatient settings . A national survey estimates that head CT examinations comprise 28% of total examinations per facility compared to the second most frequently performed examination—CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which comprises 19% of total examinations . Head CT examinations are also far more frequently performed compared to dedicated CT examinations of the facial bones, orbits, and sinuses which make up 3.9% of total examinations, CT examinations of sinuses which comprise 13%, dental CT examinations which make up 0.3%, and CT examinations of the neck soft tissues which make up approximately 1% of total examinations .

Although routine head CT examinations should not include the level of the teeth based on ideal protocol parameters, the teeth (typically maxillary but possibly both maxillary and mandibular) may be inadvertently included in the scanning field . Thus, dental disease may be incidentally seen on routine head CT examinations performed for various indications, other than dental complaints, such as headache, syncope, and trauma. Although dental disease may have implications on patient health and has been linked to cardiovascular and systemic inflammatory disease, it can be overlooked and is often underreported especially if it is in the periphery of the study such as a head CT, posing a potential blind spot for the reading radiologist . This is important because periodontal disease has been identified as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke in certain patient populations . One study found that maternal periodontitis was associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight and preeclampsia . A more recent study, which collected data on more than 65,000 postmenopausal women, found that a history of periodontal disease significantly increases the overall risk for site-specific cancers such as melanoma, breast, lung, and esophageal cancers . Although the causality of these relationships may be questioned, there is evidence that some dental disease, especially if left untreated, may lead to potentially serious pathology extending into the adjacent orbits, soft tissues, and intracranial structures, resulting in significant increase in patient morbidity and mortality . For example, odontogenic sinusitis may account for up to 12% of maxillary sinusitis, and more than 40% of deep neck infections may have a dentigerous source . There are multiple case reports of orbital cellulitis and cavernous sinus thrombosis with odontogenic origins .
