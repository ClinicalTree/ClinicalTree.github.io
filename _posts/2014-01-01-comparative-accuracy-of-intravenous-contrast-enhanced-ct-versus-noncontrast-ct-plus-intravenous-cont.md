## Rational and Objectives

To evaluate whether addition of nonenhanced computed tomography (NECT) to intravenous contrast-enhanced (CE) abdominal CT improves detection or characterization of hypervascular liver masses. Patients were referred for initial staging or follow-up with known breast, melanoma, neuroendocrine, or thyroid cancer.

## Material and Methods

The literature was searched using the patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) method. Retrieved articles were critically appraised and assigned a level of evidence based on the Oxford University Centre for Evidence-based Medicine hierarchy of validity for diagnostic studies.

## Results

One thousand one hundred studies were reviewed; only 11 studies matched the PICO of our study and were appraised. Most of the appraised articles were published in the 1990s using older technology and contrast delivery. The retrieved diagnostic performance for characterization of liver metastases showed sensitivity/specificity of 97%/76% for NECT, 97%/75% for arterial CT, and 98%/76% for portal venous phase CT in patients with breast cancer; sensitivity of 96% (arterial and portal CT) versus 100% (NECT, arterial and portal CT) in patients with melanoma; and sensitivity of 43% (portal CT) versus 17% (NECT) in patients with neuroendocrine tumor. No primary study was found for performance of different CT protocols in patients with thyroid cancer. Available evidence showed radiologists reported more conspicuous liver masses on CECT compared to NECT in patients with breast or neuroendocrine cancer.

## Conclusions

Based on existing evidence, NECT only adds a small incremental value to CECT for detection/characterization of hypervascular liver metastases. Addition of NECT increases patient's exposure to radiation and the number of images available for interpretation.

The liver is a common site of metastatic disease because of the nature of its endothelial lining and dual blood supply. Metastatic disease in the liver is 18–40 times more common than primary liver malignancy .

Imaging of the liver is often started with intravenous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) achieved in two distinct phases following intravenous contrast injection: the arterial phase (starting 25–30 seconds after the initiation of contrast agent injection) and portal venous phase (started 60–70 seconds after the initiation of the bolus). A delayed phase (approximately 180 seconds after initial bolus) may occasionally be obtained . Nonenhanced CT (NECT) alone is insensitive for detection of hepatic masses and poor at characterization of these masses . However, in some institutions, imaging of liver also includes NECT (before intravenous contrast injection) in addition to CECT, for example, in renal cell carcinoma patients . Furthermore, it is possible that addition of NECT to CECT changes patient management by affecting radiologists' confidence for characterization of liver masses or allows further characterization of significant incidental findings without additional imaging. The usefulness of imaging tests can vary significantly across institutions because of local radiological expertise, availability of equipment or personnel, and the training, experience, and biases of treating physicians and radiologists . At some institutions, arterial and portal phase CECT are used for hypervascular metastases (melanoma, neuroendocrine tumors \[NET\], thyroid carcinoma, and sometimes breast cancer ).

The blue line indicates a positive CT test result; the pink line indicates a negative result. To estimate the posttest probability for a positive result, it is derived by drawing a vertical line up to the blue curved line and then across to the y -axis. The posttest probability for a negative result is derived by drawing a vertical line up to the pink curved line and then across to the y -axis. The blue and pink curves are generated by the known sensitivity and specificity for liver metastases detection in patients with breast cancer.
