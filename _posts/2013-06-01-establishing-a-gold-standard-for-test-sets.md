## Rationale and Objectives

Test sets for assessing and improving radiologic image interpretation have been used for decades and typically evaluate performance relative to gold standard interpretations by experts. To assess test sets for screening mammography, a gold standard for whether a woman should be recalled for additional workup is needed, given that interval cancers may be occult on mammography and some findings ultimately determined to be benign require additional imaging to determine if biopsy is warranted. Using experts to set a gold standard assumes little variation occurs in their interpretations, but this has not been explicitly studied in mammography.

## Materials and Methods

Using digitized films from 314 screening mammography exams ( _n_ = 143 cancer cases) performed in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, we evaluated interpretive agreement among three expert radiologists who independently assessed whether each examination should be recalled, and the lesion location, finding type (mass, calcification, asymmetric density, or architectural distortion), and interpretive difficulty in the recalled images.

## Results

Agreement among the three expert pairs for recall/no recall was higher for cancer cases (mean 74.3 ± 6.5) than for noncancers (mean 62.6 ± 7.1). Complete agreement on recall, lesion location, finding type and difficulty ranged from 36.4% to 42.0% for cancer cases and from 43.9% to 65.6% for noncancer cases. Two of three experts agreed on recall and lesion location for 95.1% of cancer cases and 91.8% of noncancer cases, but all three experts agreed on only 55.2% of cancer cases and 42.1% of noncancer cases.

## Conclusion

Variability in expert interpretive is notable. A minimum of three independent experts combined with a consensus should be used for establishing any gold standard interpretation for test sets, especially for noncancer cases.

In radiology, test sets have been used for decades to assess and improve interpretive performance . Typically, the gold standard for interpretation is either based on observed patient outcomes or is based on expert review where a panel of experts comes to consensus on the interpretation. In the latter, the consensus decision becomes the gold standard and provides the basis for measuring individual performance. Little is known about the extent to which expert radiologists vary in interpretive assessments. Importantly, agreement among mammography experts has not been examined in the context of test set development in screening mammography, although test sets are frequently used for educational purposes.

The high prevalence of screening mammography use in the population and wide variability in radiologists' interpretive performance of mammography makes the issue of testing radiologists for interpretation ability clinically important. Test sets are also useful for evaluating interventions aimed at improving interpretation, because it is difficult to assess changes in screening mammography performance in clinical practice because of low, within-practice breast cancer prevalence and the long lag-time for obtaining true cancer status. For screening mammography test sets, breast cancer status may be considered the ultimate gold standard, but it also unrealistically applies a diagnostic standard of performance to a screening test. In contrast, a gold standard for whether or not the exam should be recalled for additional workup and the location and type of any significant findings would be more clinically relevant, because it measures performance based on the fact that some interval cancers are occult on prior mammography and some findings ultimately determined to be benign required additional imaging to determine if biopsy is warranted. The nature of screening makes having clear objective criteria for a recall decision to evaluate a suspicious finding or identification of significant findings difficult, but using biopsy results within 1 year of screening as the gold standard unrealistically judges all false negatives and false positives as avoidable errors.
