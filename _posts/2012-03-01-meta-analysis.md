## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic properties of  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) or PET/computed tomography (CT) and bone scintigraphy in the detection of osseous metastases in patients with lung cancer.

## Materials and Methods

MEDLINE was searched for relevant original articles published between January 1995 and August 2010. Inclusion criteria were as follows: FDG-PET or PET/CT and bone scintigraphy was carried out to detect bone metastases in patients with lung cancer, sufficient data were presented to construct a 2 × 2 contingency table, and histopathologic analysis and/or close clinical and imaging follow-up and/or radiographic confirmation by multiple imaging modalities was used as the reference standard. Two reviewers independently extracted data related to research design, sample size, imaging techniques, technical characteristics, reference standards, methods of imaging interpretation, and totals of true-positives, false-positives, true-negatives, and false-negatives. Stata was used to obtain per patient and per lesion pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios, and areas under summary receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were calculated.

## Results

The pooled patient-based sensitivity of FDG-PET or PET/CT was 0.93 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.88–0.96), specificity was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.91–0.98), and the AUC was 0.94. The pooled sensitivity of bone scans was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.79–0.93), specificity was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.62–0.92), and the AUC was 0.91. The pooled lesion-based sensitivity of FDG-PET or PET/CT was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84–0.97), specificity was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80–0.96), and the AUC was 0.97. The pooled sensitivity of bone scans was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.87–0.95), specificity was 0.57 (95% CI, 0.09–0.95), and the AUC was 0.92.

## Conclusions

Although FDG-PET or PET/CT has higher sensitivity and specificity than bone scintigraphy, further research with a less biased design is needed to determine the most efficacious imaging modality for the detection of metastatic lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer as well as the leading cause of cancer death in men. Among women, lung cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death . A typical staging system includes the assessment of primary tumor characteristics, detection of lymph node metastasis, and detection of distant metastases to determine the treatment regimen for lung cancer. Historically, 30% to 40% of patients with advanced lung cancer have developed bone metastasis . Curative surgical resection is impossible in these late-stage patients. Alternatively, chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or best supportive care is considered advisable . Furthermore, with the development of newer, more sensitive screening and imaging technologies, the proportion of late-stage patients is expected to increase following initial implementation.

Osseous metastases in lung cancer are typically detectable via bone scintigraphy (BS), because of its high sensitivity and ability to survey the entire skeleton quickly at a relatively low cost. The uptake of skeletal-seeking radiotracers depicts osteoblastic activity and regional blood flow to bone. However, the specificity of BS is lowered by benign processes such as osteoarthritis, fractures, and inflammation. Suspicious abnormalities identified on BS generally require further investigation using x-ray, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, or biopsy for confirmation.
