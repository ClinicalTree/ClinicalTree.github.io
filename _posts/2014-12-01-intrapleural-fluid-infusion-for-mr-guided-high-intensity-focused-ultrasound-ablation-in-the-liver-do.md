## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance–guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) ablation of tumors in the liver dome is challenging because of the presence of air in the costophrenic angle. In this study, we used a porcine liver model and a clinical MR-HIFU system to assess the feasibility and safety of using intrapleural fluid infusion (IPI) to create an acoustic window for MR-HIFU ablation in the liver dome.

## Materials and Methods

Healthy adult Dalland land pigs ( _n_ = 6) under general anesthesia were used with animal committee approval. Degassed saline (200–800 mL) was infused into the intrapleural space under ultrasound guidance. A clinical 1.5-T MR-HIFU system was used to perform sonications (4-mm treatment cells, 300–450 W, 20–30 seconds) in the liver dome under real-time MR thermometry. An intercostal firing technique was used to prevent rib heating in one experiment. Technical success was defined as a temperature increase (>10°C) in the target area. After termination, the animal was examined for thermal damage to liver, diaphragm, pleura, lung, or intercostal muscle.

## Results

An acoustic window was established in all animals. A temperature increase in the target area was achieved in all animals (max. 47°C–67°C). MR thermometry showed no heating outside the target area. Intercostal firing effectively reduced rib heating (55°C vs. 42°C). Postmortem examination revealed no unwanted thermal damage. One complication occurred, in the first experiment, because of an ill-suited needle (displacement of the needle).

## Conclusions

The results indicate that IPI may be used safely to assist MR-HIFU ablation of tumors in the liver dome. For reliable tissue coagulation, IPI must be combined with an intercostal sonication technique. Considering the proportion of patients with tumors in the liver dome, IPI widens the applicability of MR-HIFU ablation for liver tumors considerably.

Magnetic resonance–guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (MR-HIFU) is an image-guided, noninvasive, thermal ablation technique which allows for precisely targeted tumor ablation while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. The MR guidance provides near real-time image guidance and temperature feedback during ablation . MR-HIFU is used clinically for the treatment of uterine fibroids and bone metastases and is currently under investigation for several other oncologic applications such as ablation of prostate, pancreas, breast, and liver tumors and for targeted drug delivery .

For clinical implementation of MR-HIFU ablation of liver tumors, several organ-specific challenges have to be overcome . One of these challenges is the fact that the lung overlaps the liver dome, which is the cranial subdiaphragmatic part of the liver in the costophrenic angle (or costodiaphragmatic recess). This air–tissue interface forms an impassable barrier for the ultrasound beam, preventing ablation of tumors in the liver dome. To overcome this challenge, the use of intrapleural fluid infusion (IPI) has been proposed. This creates an acoustic window by infusing fluid into the costophrenic angle. This strategy has been reported for low-intensity diagnostic ultrasound guidance of percutaneous ablation procedures in the liver dome (eg, during radiofrequency \[RF\] ablation) . The use of IPI in combination with ultrasound-guided HIFU has been reported; however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported which were dedicated to the IPI technique, in particular not with real-time MR thermometry .

The quality of the acoustic window depended mostly on displacement of the right lower lung lobe.
