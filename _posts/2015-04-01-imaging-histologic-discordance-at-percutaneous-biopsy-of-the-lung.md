## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of imaging–histologic discordance in a cohort of patients undergoing computed tomography (CT)–guided lung biopsy for focal lung disease.

## Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed of 186 patients who underwent percutaneous lung biopsy of a parenchymal lesion at our institution between January and December 2009. Diagnostic radiology reports of CT or positron emission tomography–CTs performed before biopsy were used to classify the lesion as malignant or benign by five readers. Pathology reports of the biopsied lesions were classified by three readers. Inter-reader agreement and imaging–histologic concordance were quantified using kappa statistics. Discordant benign cases were then revisited to determine downstream effects.

## Results

Inter-reader agreement on report content was substantial or almost perfect with kappas >0.783. Kappas for concordance were as follows: malignant (0.448), primary lung cancer (0.517), metastatic disease to lung (0.449), benign (0.510), and overall agreement (0.381). Of the twelve discordant benign cases that were revisited, four were found to be false negatives, resulting in a delay in diagnosis.

## Conclusions

Our study of imaging–histologic discordance in percutaneous biopsy of lung lesions supports the need for imaging report standardization and improved integration and communication between the fields of radiology and pathology.

Radiology and pathology play central roles in cancer diagnosis but typically report findings independently of one another. Independent reporting can increase radiologic–pathologic discordance, defined as a discrepancy between imaging interpretation and histologic findings . Radiologic–pathologic correlation has been studied in various imaging specialties to gauge interpretive performance and accuracy, and to identify radiographic features corresponding to histologic findings . However, few studies have attempted to assess the utility of integrated radiologic–pathologic correlation for establishing imaging–histologic concordance or discordance as a method to prospectively identify missed carcinomas due to biopsy sampling error .

Radiologic–pathologic discordance may be categorized as either discordant malignant or discordant benign. The former refers to a lesion that appears radiologically benign, but is malignant on histology; the latter refers to a lesion suspicious for malignancy on imaging but benign histologically . In mammography, with the adoption of the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), this notion of discordance fits naturally due to strict, unambiguous radiologic guidelines governing diagnostic conclusions. BI-RADS provides a framework that allows instances of discordance to receive special consideration such that ostensibly negative pathology in cases of high radiographic suspicion warrant prompt repeat biopsy .
