## Rationale and Objectives

We present an optical mammography study that aims to develop quantitative measures of pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in patients with breast cancer. Such quantitative measures are based on the concentrations of oxyhemoglobin (\[HbO  2 \]), deoxyhemoglobin (\[Hb\]), total hemoglobin (\[HbT\]), and hemoglobin saturation (SO  2 ) in breast tissue at the tumor location and at sequential time points during chemotherapy.

## Materials and Methods

Continuous-wave, spectrally resolved optical mammography was performed in transmission and parallel-plate geometry on 10 patients before treatment initiation and at each NAC administration (mean number of optical mammography sessions: 12, range: 7–18). Data on two patients were discarded for technical reasons. The patients were categorized as responders (R, >50% decrease in tumor size), or nonresponders (NR, <50% decrease in tumor size) based on imaging and histopathology results.

## Results

At 50% completion of the NAC regimen (therapy midpoint), R (6/8) demonstrated significant decreases in SO  2 (−27% ± 4%) and \[HbT\] (−35 ± 4 µM) at the tumor location with respect to baseline values. By contrast, NR (2/8) showed nonsignificant changes in SO  2 and \[HbT\] at therapy midpoint. We introduce a cumulative response index as a quantitative measure of the individual patient's response to therapy. At therapy midpoint, the SO  2 -based cumulative response index had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% for the identification of R.

## Conclusions

These results show that optical mammography is a promising tool to assess individual response to NAC at therapy midpoint to guide further decision making for neoadjuvant therapy.

## Introduction

## Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC)

NAC is administered to patients before surgery in an effort to reduce the primary tumor size, whereas adjuvant chemotherapy is administered following surgery in an effort to reduce the risk of residual disease and cancer recurrence. A patient's response to NAC may be assessed by physical examination or breast imaging (clinical response), or by histology post surgery (pathologic response) . Assessing response to neoadjuvant treatment is crucial, as a pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as having no residual carcinoma in the resected breast tissue and in axillary lymph nodes, has been associated with improved survival . Strictly defined, pCR requires the absence of invasive tumor in the resected specimen, although some clinicians use the more restrictive requirement of no residual invasive or in situ disease . Because of the better outcome associated with pCR, finding tools that can define the individual clinical response during the course of therapy and accurately predicting pathologic response would be of great benefit. This is also true in patients with poor response to treatment, as early identification of this problem may allow the physician to alter the chemotherapy regimen to avoid disease progression and to identify a more effective chemotherapy option.

## Imaging Modalities Under Investigation to Monitor Therapy Response

Imaging methods sensitive to functional tissue changes are being investigated for monitoring breast cancer patients' response to NAC. Functional tumor changes are of particular interest because of the limitations of structural assessment of tumor response based on physical examination, ultrasound imaging, or mammography . Current imaging methods used to assess clinical response are via a decrease in the standard uptake value of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose by positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) , or a decrease in tumor size by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . Both of these methods, however, are expensive and invasive, as PET/CT requires an injection of a radiopharmaceutical, and MRI requires an injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent. Furthermore, the appropriate timing and frequency for assessing clinical response have not been established, and studies thus far have typically imaged at a single time point during therapy .

The magnetic resonance imaging axial contrast-enhanced subtraction image ( top right ) demonstrates a 4.4-cm irregular mass with additional areas of nonmass enhancement extending to the nipple and laterally.
