## Rationale and Objectives

In this article, we review the core principles of bone physiology alongside imaging examples that demonstrate such principles.

## Materials and Methods

The core principles of bone physiology are reviewed and further solidified with a corresponding abnormal pathophysiologic example. The key principles of bone physiology to be reviewed include the following: (1) formation and growth, (2) maintenance and repair, (3) metabolism and regulation, and (4) neoplastic disease. Lastly, a collection of secondary bone diseases is presented to demonstrate the skeletal manifestations of numerous systemic diseases. With this integrative method, we hope to emphasize the value of using radiology to teach physiology within a clinical context. This is especially relevant now, as many US medical schools undergo curricular reform with more emphasis on integrative interdisciplinary learning. Ultimately, we intend to provide a paradigm for incorporating radiology into the pre-clinical medical curriculum through a review of basic science physiology that underlies key radiographic findings of the skeletal system.

## Results

Radiology is known for its role in helping make diagnoses and clinical decisions. However, radiology is also well suited to enhance medical education by offering the ability to visualize physiology in action. This is especially true in skeletal radiology, where radiographic osseous changes represent a wide range of physiological processes. Therefore, skeletal radiology can be a useful tool for illustrating concepts of physiology that underlie the normal and abnormal radiologic appearances of bone.

## Conclusion

Radiology is an important but underutilized tool for demonstrating concepts in bone physiology.

## Introduction and Background

One of the greatest underappreciated opportunities in medical education is the use of radiologic images to teach the basic medical sciences. Too often, medical students learn such subjects as anatomy, physiology, and pathology from text, diagrams, cadavers, and animal models rather than from living human subjects. Radiology makes it possible to visualize living human structure, function, disease, and injury in ways that can help learners gain a much deeper understanding of the material, creating indelible images that they carry with them into practice for many years. Nonetheless, radiology is underutilized in this regard.

Despite the explosion of diagnostic imaging utilization in clinical practice, estimated to be nearly twice the rate of laboratory and pharmaceutical usage , the role of radiology in medical education has remained stagnant across allopathic and osteopathic medical schools for decades . If available, a formal radiology clerkship is typically offered to medical students as a fourth-year elective, long after the basic science coursework has ended. This approach isolates radiology fromits foundation in the basic sciences and may put students at a disadvantage in their future clinical practices.
