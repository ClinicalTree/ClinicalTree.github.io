This is a case-based textbook of brain imaging. The intended audience includes anyone interested in learning about neuroradiology, but is written primarily for residency level training. The author, Dr. Laurie A. Loevner, is a neuroradiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. She was the author of the first brain imaging case review series.

The standard case review series format is used. Each case has a selected number of images that allow the reader to construct a differential diagnosis followed by four questions designed to highlight teaching points related to the imaging or pathology. The questions are answered on the following page along with a comment section that entails a brief but detailed discussion of the pertinent pathology and imaging highlights. There is an Opening Round (50 cases), Fair Game (100 cases), and Challenge (50 cases) section, each of which progress in level of difficulty. Approximately 90% of the cases are new and 45 new diseases are presented that were not in the first edition.

This is an excellent follow-up to the first edition. The cases presented offer a diverse breadth of pathology, aptly chosen for the resident level reader. Follow-up questions are helpful for honing in on key concepts and the comment sections are very well written with succinct, pertinent discussions. As with the first edition, the image quality is superb throughout the text. There is a greater emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging when compared with the first edition.

This is an excellent addition to the case review series and a must have for any radiology resident. It is a useful tool for learning about neurologic diseases, generating differential diagnoses based on imaging findings and learning discriminators of various diseases with similar imaging characteristics. The addition of so many new cases and different pathologies makes this a worthwhile purchase for owners of the first edition.
