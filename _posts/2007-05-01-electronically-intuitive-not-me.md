I really cannot blame it on age, except that there are so many more electronic gadgets and computer applications each year. But I am not intuitive in addressing most of these electronic things that are now part of everyone’s life including mine.

This goes for computers, for cell phones, for television sets, for GPS units, and even for some of our kitchen appliances. All of these come with instructions. Until recently, such instructions came in printed pamphlets that suffered only from being written in what is unkindly termed “Japlish” or “Chinglish” reflecting the site of manufacture.

The example that still abrades in my mind was my purchase of a hand-held GPS for my boat a few years ago. My physicist friend Bob went with me to buy it. I settled for one of the simpler ones. While I was paying for it, Bob began playing with it. As we left the store to walk to the car, he handed it to me, saying, “It’s entirely programmed for you.”

“What the heck did you do?” I responded. “You didn’t even look at the instructions.”

“I didn’t need them, I understand these things,” he answered. “But I will erase the program so you can start over.” With a few jabs of his thumb, he did so.

When I got home, I got out the GPS, opened the instructions and in a few paragraphs found myself totally lost. With a lot of help, I have mastered the basic functions. But I do not do any of the fancy things because I still have not figured out how to do what he did in three minutes.
