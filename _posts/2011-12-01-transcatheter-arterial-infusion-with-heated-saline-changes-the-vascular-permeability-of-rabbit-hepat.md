## Rationale and Objectives

The vascular permeability of tumors can be changed by transarterial infusion heat, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the underlying causes of changes in tumor vascular permeability after heated perfusion via two different modes.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty rabbits with VX2 hepatic tumors were randomly divided into three groups of 10 rabbits each. The hepatic artery was selectively catheterized via a femoral approach, and unheated saline (control group) or heated saline (60°C) was then injected in either a continuous (transcatheter arterial continuous perfusion \[TACP\]) or a pulsed (transcatheter arterial pulsed perfusion \[TAPP\]) manner. Changes in vascular permeability in the tumors were assessed using the following markers and methods: (1) qualitative assessment by visual estimation on digital subtraction angiography performed after the heat infusion procedure on live animals and quantitative assessment by spectrophotometry using Evans blue dye extravasation on tumor and liver tissue after animals were sacrificed and (2) kinase domain receptor or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), expressed in vascular endothelial cells, assessed by immunohistochemical staining, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

## Results

Tumor staining increased in the TAPP group more than in the TACP group, but not in the control group, assessed on digital subtraction angiography. Extracted dye was higher in tumors in the TAPP group than in those in the TACP group; extracted dye in both groups was higher than in the control group. Kinase domain receptor protein and messenger ribonucleic acid expression were both higher in the TAPP group than in the TACP and control groups. VEGF protein expression was lower in the TAPP and TACP groups than in the control group, but VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid expression was higher in the TACP group than in the TAPP and control groups, and VEGF messenger ribonucleic acid expression was lower in the TAPP group than in the control group.

## Conclusions

The vascular permeability of rabbit VX2 tumors significantly increased after arterial pulsed heated infusion, and the protein kinase domain receptor may play a key role in this increase of tumor vascular permeability.

Therapies using hyperthermia have gained acceptance for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, such as radiofrequency ablation , microwave coagulation therapy , laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy , and percutaneous hot saline injection therapy . These local thermotherapy methods have proven effective in patients with single, nodular-type hepatocellular carcinomas <5 cm, and they are designed to produce heat-induced coagulation necrosis . However, during treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinomas >5 cm or with multifocal tumors, to reach all areas of the tumor and to induce complete necrosis, percutaneous puncture must be performed repeatedly, and the insertion site must be changed , so the rate of complications, such as arterioportal shunts and bile duct injury, may be up to 12% , and a needle-track tumor-seeding rate of 12.5% has been reported in patients after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation . In contrast, if the heat is distributed throughout the tumor by transhepatic arterial infusion, the insertion site need not be changed, and the complications of these local thermotherapy methods may be avoided. Thus, transarterial infusion with heated drugs may be a safe and promising new strategy that is able to achieve a better therapeutic effect in the treatment of both large and multifocal hepatic tumors.

Recently, regional hyperthermic hepatic perfusion has been used in the clinic in combination with chemotherapy to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment . In vitro studies have demonstrated that the best anticancer effect is achieved at 42°C to 45°C for 30 minutes , and we have verified that the temperature of heated saline (60°C) that reaches the region of the tumor is not <42°C after injection and that perfusion of 60°C saline is safe and minimally damaging to the normal liver tissue of tumor-bearing rabbits . In vivo studies have also demonstrated that if heated drugs are infused directly into the target vessel of a tumor, the heat of the infusion can change the tumor's vascular permeability , but the mechanism or mechanisms remain unknown. Because the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and kinase domain receptor (KDR) proteins are two important factors related to vascular permeability , they were observed and evaluated in this study. The aim of this study was to analyze the cause of the change in tumor vascular permeability after different modes of heated perfusion.
