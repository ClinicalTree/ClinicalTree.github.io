## Rationale and Objectives

Using lower tube voltage can reduce the exposure to radiation and the dose of contrast agent. However, lower tube voltage is often linked to more noise and poor image quality, which create a need for more effective technology to resolve this problem. To explore the feasibility of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) in patients with obesity at low tube voltage (100 kV) and low contrast agent concentration (270 mg/mL) using iterative reconstruction.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 48 patients with body mass index greater than 30 kg/m  2 were included and randomly divided into two groups. Group A received a traditional protocol (iopromide 370 mg/mL + 120 kV); group B received a protocol with low tube voltage (100 kV), low contrast agent concentration (270 mg/mL), and iterative reconstruction. The effective dose (ED), average attenuation values, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), the figure of merit (FOM), image quality scores, and the total iodine intake were compared.

## Results

No significant differences in average CT attenuations, SNR, CNR, and subjective scores were noticed between the two groups ( _P_ > 0.05), whereas the FOM of group B was significantly higher than that of group A. Effective radiation dose, total iodine, and iodine injection rate in group B were lower than those of group A ( _P_ <  0.01).

## Conclusions

In patients with obesity, isotonic contrast agent with low iodine concentration and low-dose CCTA were feasible. Substantial reduction in radiation dose and the iodine intake could be achieved without compromising the image quality.

## Introduction

Currently, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is being widely used in clinical practice with remarkable accuracy. However, the exposure to X-ray radiation and the risk of renal impairment associated with contrast agents are the main limitations . In recent years, rational use of radiation (as lower as reasonably achievable) has been recommended , and research on reducing the radiation dose while maintaining the diagnostic performance of CT scan has become a hot topic . Using lower tube voltage is an effective way to reduce the radiation dose. At the same time, decreasing the dose of contrast agent has also drawn attention as it can reduce the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) . On the contrary, lower tube voltage is often linked to more noise and poor image quality. Therefore, iterative reconstruction (IR) technology was developed to reduce the image noises and improve image quality, thereby showing advantages over traditional filtered back projection (FBP) technology , which lays the foundation for the application of low concentrations of contrast agents. Recently, adaptive iterative dose reduction (AIDR) IR algorithm has been used in clinical practice. It compares the imaging data to a noise model based on statistics that takes into account the electronic and photon noise. This method can greatly improve the image reconstruction speed, reduce wax-like artifacts in the reconstructed image, and improve the SNR and the CNR .

Obesity is closely associated with coronary artery disease (CAD), and it has a high degree of correlation with coronary artery calcification. In recent years, there has been a steady growth in the prevalence of obesity . On coronary artery examination in patients with obesity, increased noise and decreased image quality are often noticed due to the decreased X-ray penetration, which may even affect the diagnostic accuracy . The process of conducting a low-dose examination in patients with obesity is challenging. According to the International Steering Committee of Cardiovascular CT recommendations, while performing CCTA in patients weighing <85 kg or with a body mass index (BMI) of <30 kg/m  2 , 100 kV tube voltage is preferred . Many previous reports have demonstrated the feasibility of low concentrations of contrast agents and low tube voltage applied to CCTA in patients with BMI < 30 kg/m  2 . In a recent study, a “double low” scanning protocol (low tube voltage/low iodine dose contrast agent) and the AIDR reconstruction algorithm were used for CCTA in patients with a BMI of 26–30 kg/m  2 . The results showed that the use of 320-row CT with a “double low” scanning protocol not only provided images of diagnostic quality, but also reduced both radiation dose and the iodine intake during scanning .
