## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of semiautomated global quantification of left ventricular myocardial perfusion derived from stress dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (CTMPI) for detection of territorial perfusion deficits (PD).

## Materials and Methods

Dynamic CTMPI datasets of 71 patients were analyzed using semiautomated volume-based software to calculate global myocardial blood flow (MBF), myocardial blood volume, and volume transfer constant. Optimal cutoff values to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these parameters for detection of one- to three-vessel territories with PD in comparison to visual analysis were calculated.

## Results

Nonsignificant differences ( _P_ = 0.694) were found for average global MBF in patients without PD and single-territorial PD. Significant differences were found for mean global MBF in patients with PD in two ( _P_ < 0.0058) and three territories ( _P_ < 0.0003). Calculated optimal thresholds for global MBF and myocardial blood volume resulted in a sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of 100% for detection of three-vessel territory PD. For detection of ≥2 territories with PD, global MBF was superior to other parameters (sensitivity 81.3%, specificity 90.9%, and negative predictive value 94.3%).

## Conclusions

Semiautomated global quantification of left ventricular MBF during stress dynamic CTMPI shows high diagnostic accuracy for detection of ≥2 vessel territories with PD, facilitating identification of patients with multi-territorial myocardial PD.

## Introduction

Stress dynamic computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (CTMPI) is a recently developed technique that has been shown to allow for the detection of myocardial perfusion deficits during coronary CT angiography (CCTA) . Prior studies have established the feasibility of this approach and have demonstrated its capability to accurately evaluate the hemodynamic relevance of coronary artery stenosis in comparison to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with or without functional flow reserve (FFR) measurements . Thus, the combination of CCTA and CTMPI may allow for the comprehensive noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and hemodynamic relevance of stenosis during a single examination.

Whereas prior studies have focused on the segmental and territorial evaluation of perfusion deficits on CTMPI , recently, it was demonstrated that manual global quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion also correlates with visual segmental analysis and presence of coronary artery stenosis . By calculating optimal cutoff values for global left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial blood volume (MBV), a recent study reported a sensitivity of 100% for both parameters for the detection of three-vessel perfusion defects . However, the diagnostic accuracy of manual or semiautomated global measurements for the detection of one- or two-vessel territories with perfusion deficits remains unknown. Furthermore, it was recently demonstrated that semiautomated segmental quantitative analysis during CTMPI using dedicated three-dimensional (3D) software is feasible and provides similar results compared to manual segmental assessment while allowing for substantial time savings and showing strong agreement with single-photon emission CT (SPECT) .
