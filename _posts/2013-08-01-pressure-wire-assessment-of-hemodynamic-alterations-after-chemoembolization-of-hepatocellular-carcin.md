## Rationale and Objectives

The end point of chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma is qualitative. We intended to determine the feasibility of measuring intra-arterial pressure changes after chemoembolization and hypothesized that pressures would increase in the distal hepatic artery after the procedure.

## Materials and Methods

Before and after chemoembolization, systemic (S) systolic and mean pressures were measured along with celiac (C), lobar (L), and distal (D) hepatic artery pressures with a pressure wire. Corrected pressures were defined as a ratio with S as the denominator to account for intraprocedural S changes. Changes in the systolic and mean corrected pressures at each location (C/S, L/S, and D/S) were evaluated using paired _t_ tests. Pressure changes in patients with and without tumor response using the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors were also compared.

## Results

Sixteen tumors were treated in 15 patients. One patient had bilobar tumors with separate supplying arteries. The only significant pressure change was systolic D/S ( _P_ = .02), while mean D/S approached significance ( _P_ = .08). C/S and L/S did not change significantly after chemoembolization. Eleven of 16 patients had a complete response, whereas the other five had a partial response after chemoembolization. When comparing complete to partial responders, no changes in systolic or mean C/S, L/S, or D/S reached statistical significance (all _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusions

Measuring change in hepatic artery pressures is feasible. Distal intra-arterial corrected pressures increase significantly after chemoembolization. Further study to determine the ability to predict tumor necrosis at follow-up imaging is warranted.

Chemoembolization for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has gained acceptance for the treatment of Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer intermediate-stage disease and improves survival in patients treated for palliation . Despite these clinical achievements, determining the appropriate therapeutic end point from chemoembolization remains qualitative, with completion frequently described as “relative stasis” within the treated artery . The lack of a precise end point with chemoembolization may well contribute to varying outcomes after treatment. Undertreatment can necessitate additional unwanted sessions of therapy, whereas overtreatment can result in liver decompensation .

In patients with coronary ischemia, arterial pressure measurements across stenoses with a flow-sensitive wire (PressureWire Aeris; St Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) improve outcomes compared to decisions made by visual assessment alone . The purpose of this pilot study was to prospectively determine the feasibility of measuring intra-arterial pressure changes after chemoembolization of HCC. We hypothesized that pressures in the hepatic arteries would be measurable and that the pressures in the treated end artery would increase after chemoembolization with obstruction of distal flow. A secondary goal was to correlate changes in pressure measurements with tumor response outcomes.
