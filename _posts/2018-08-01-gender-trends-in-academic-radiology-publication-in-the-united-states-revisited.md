## Rationale and Objectives

Although substantial increases in publications by female academic radiologists have appeared over the last several decades, it is possible that the rate of increase is decreasing. We examined temporal trends in gender composition for full-time radiology faculty, radiology residents, and medical students over a 46-year period.

## Methods

We examined authorship gender trends to determine if the increases in female authorship seen since 1970 have been sustained in recent years and whether female radiologists continue to publish in proportion to their numbers in academic departments. Original articles for selected years in _Radiology_ and in the _American Journal of Roentgenology_ between 1970 and 2016 were examined to determine the gender of first, corresponding, and last authors. Generalized linear models evaluated (1) changes in proportions of female authorship over time and (2) associations between proportions of female authorship and female radiology faculty representation.

## Results

While linear increases in first, corresponding, and senior authorships were observed for female radiologists from 1970 to 2000, the rate of increase in female first and corresponding authorships then changed, with the slope of the first author relationship decreasing from 0.81 to 0.34, corresponding to 47% fewer female first authors added per year. In contrast, the proportion of female last authorship continued to increase at the same rate. The proportion of female first authorship was linearly related to the proportion of female radiology faculty from 1970 to 2016.

## Conclusions

Annual increases in first author academic productivity of female radiologists have lessened in the past 16 years, possibly related to reductions in the growth of female radiology faculty and trainees. As mixed, compared to homogeneous gender, authorship teams are associated with more citations, efforts to encourage more women to pursue careers in academic radiology could benefit the radiology research community.

## Background

Academic radiology has experienced increases in both absolute number and relative proportion of female radiology faculty and residents over the past several decades. In addition, a recent study exploring the effects of gender diversity on research productivity found that gender-heterogeneous working groups can produce higher-quality science, as evidenced by higher numbers of citations . This result underscores the importance of continuing to strive for gender parity in radiology departments. Although the increased female representation in radiology departments seems promising with respect to research quality, women still remain underrepresented at the associate professor and professor ranks and in upperlevel radiology department administration (  https://www.aamc.org/members/gwims/statistics/ ). Authorship can profoundly influence career trajectory in academic radiology. Moreover, academic productivity can profoundly influence decisions regarding faculty recruitment, hiring, and promotion . In addition, recent evidence suggests that salary determinations for medical school faculty can be influenced by publication productivity .

Publication of original research in peer-reviewed scientific journals is an important objective measure of academic productivity . Author placement also has implications for accountability and allocation of credit and can be used in determining worthiness for promotion, allocated research time, and research funding . With the exception of a minority of journals that list authors alphabetically, most journals list authors according to the author-rated level of contribution . The designation of first author is important because first authors generally make substantial contributions to every element of the research except provision of resources . Many studies are known by the name of their first author, lending credence to the idea that the first author plays an instrumental role in performing the work and in writing the manuscript .

who held either an MD or an equivalent degree, were identified in the journal _Radiology._ First authors also served as the corresponding author in 65.7% of the _Radiology_ articles examined and last authors served as corresponding authors in 20.9% of the articles examined. For the selected years during the 46-year period studied, a total of 1811 first authors, 1673 last authors, and 1818 corresponding authors were identified from _AJR_ . First authors also served as the corresponding author in 69.2% of the _AJR_ articles examined and last authors served as corresponding authors 16.7% of the time. Overall, gender was determined for 99% of the listed authors. For the sampled years over the 46-year time period, 23.5% of the first authors were female, 22.2% of the corresponding authors were female, and 15.2% of the last authors were female.
