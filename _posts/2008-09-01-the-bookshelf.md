The _Atlas of PET/CT with SPECT/CT_ introduces readers to rapidly emerging molecular imaging technologies in an easy to follow format. Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) cases occupy a much larger proportion of the book compared to single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT)/CT cases. The PET/CT cases are organized by organ/region sections. These include the brain, head and neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and the extremities. Each section starts with normal images, followed by common pitfalls and common disease case presentations. The presentation is similar to clinical scenarios, including patient's history, imaging findings, and diagnosis. A brief summary of teaching points is provided at the end of each case, which would be very useful, especially to beginners. The SPECT/CT sections provide cases of SPECT/CT applications in octreotide, I-131, metaiodobenzylguanidine, gallium 67, ProstaScint, parathyroid, bone, leukocytes, and cardiac SPECT/CT studies.

The organization of the Atlas is unique compared to other nuclear medicine books and has pros and cons. Radiologists should find it easy to follow with the organization of contents based on body parts, whereas nuclear medicine physicians might miss the familiar systemic disease approach and would have to rely on the index in the back of the book for disease entities.

The introductory section is devoted to technical consideration of PET/CT and SPECT/CT images and is well written. The authors shared with readers their expertise and experiences on assessing scanners and operating an imaging center in a very practical way. Some readers might want to skip the section but most readers will find the section very useful.

Although the paper copy of the Atlas provides readers with a snapshot of whole-body PET/CT and SPECT/CT images, the accompanied CD-ROM contains much more information of representative cases from each section. The electronic imaging software provided by HERMES is of quite good quality. Readers can scroll through whole-body PET and CT images with CT window, zoom, and intensity manipulations. The readers can also fuse the PET images with CT images, as in the clinical setting. In addition, the rotational maximum intensity projection images provide readers with an overall picture of disease burden.

The main audience is radiology and nuclear medicine residents, fellows, and senior medical students. Radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians not reporting PET/CT on a daily basis might find the book educational. The book would also be helpful to oncologists and surgeons. Trainees should find the Atlas an excellent supplement to PET/CT text books. To have a maximal benefit from Atlas, a certain familiarity with sectional imaging is required. Nuclear medicine residents and physicians without any background of sectional CT images might find a CT-sectional Atlas necessary for anatomic locations, because the Atlas provides minimal description of CT findings.
