## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether high-risk plaque (HRP) and calcium assessed by coronary computed tomography (CT) could predict future cardiovascular events after second-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) placement.

## Materials and Methods

We analyzed 317 patients from December 2012 to April 2015 who underwent coronary CT followed by DES placement. HRP was defined as a plaque with positive remodeling and low attenuation or a plaque with a napkin-ring sign. Coronary calcium was assessed by Agatston score (AS). Patients were divided into three groups: low risk, HRP negative and AS <400; intermediate risk, HRP positive and AS ≥400; high risk, HRP positive and AS ≥400. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, fatal arrhythmia, or repeated revascularization. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the distribution of time to events.

## Results

A total of 74 events (23%) occurred during a median follow-up of 25.8 months. Patients with primary end points had HRP more frequently (70% vs 51%, _P_ = 0.003) and were more calcified (AS, 471 \[interquartile range, 143–1614\] vs 289 \[interquartile range, 63–787\]; _P_ = 0.01) than patients without primary end points. The frequency of primary end point increased significantly in the intermediate- and high-risk patients ( _P_ = 0.0011). Multivariate analysis showed that the hazard ratio of the intermediate- and high-risk groups was 1.91 (95% confidence interval, 1.04–3.77; _P_ = 0.037) and 2.66 (95% confidence interval, 1.27–5.73; _P_ = 0.009), respectively.

## Conclusion

Plaque and calcification analysis by coronary CT could predict future cardiovascular events after second-generation DES placement.

## Introduction

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a widely used method to treat coronary artery stenosis . The frequency of in-stent restenosis (ISR) and target-vessel failure (TVF) was initially high with bare-metal stents but decreased after the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs) . Increased stent thrombosis using first-generation DES remained a problem, but the second-generation DES reduced its frequency . However, repeated revascularization because of ISR, TVF, or de novo lesions remains a concern.

Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) allowed clear depiction of coronary plaques . Several plaque characteristics such as low attenuation , positive remodeling , and napkin-ring sign (NRS) have been associated with high-risk plaques (HRPs). Previous studies have shown that patients with these plaques, as well as coronary calcium detected by CT, are at risk of future cardiovascular events . We hypothesized that these characteristics would be a predictor for future events in patients who underwent PCI. Thus, the objective of the present study was to investigate whether CT-detected HRP and coronary calcium could predict future cardiovascular events after second-generation DES placement.
