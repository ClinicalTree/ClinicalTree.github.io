Radiology practice involves extracting diagnostically useful information from medical images. Judgment is a necessary component of this process, as it is in all other medical specialties. Although based on clinical expertise, a radiologist's judgment remains a subjective skill.

The subjective component of radiology practice can make it difficult to measure the level of diagnostic performance. Simple diagnostic performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity are a start, but they can mask the underlying variability of radiology readers. For example, radiologists are constantly faced with the tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity caused by differing thresholds for calling an exam abnormal or indicative of a particular disease. We know that in radiology practice, some radiologists tend to be “overcallers” (higher sensitivity but lower specificity, on average), and some tend to be “undercallers” (lower sensitivity but higher specificity, on average) . Who has the “right” sensitivity and specificity?

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis adjusts for possible differences in reader thresholds so that “overcallers” and “undercallers” can be considered on the same scale. If we compare two different imaging techniques, we want to know if there is a difference in sensitivity and/or specificity that is not due to differences in reader thresholds. ROC analysis allows us to tease out these real underlying differences.

This issue of _Academic Radiology_ is the first of two issues honoring the memory of Dr. Charles E. Metz, a pioneer in the application of ROC analysis to the evaluation of radiology exams . It is fitting that Dr. Metz is honored in this journal because _Academic Radiology_ has published some of the seminal articles in ROC analysis . Among _Academic Radiology_ articles published in the past 5 years, 2 of the 10 most cited articles have been about ROC analysis, and they happened to be coauthored by Dr. Metz .

This issue features 10 articles sampling the latest original work and reviews on ROC analysis. Many of the authors are protégés and/or former collaborators of Dr. Metz. These associations were not requirements for inclusion in this issue and simply reflect the tremendous influence that Dr. Metz had on the work in this field.

The first article describes an exercise that I developed to teach basic principles of ROC analysis . I have given didactic lectures about ROC analysis but have not been completely satisfied with their apparent effectiveness or connection with the audience. In other words, I saw some students dosing off, and I thought I was boring. When asked to teach a class in a new course, I decided to address the boredom issue by adding an interactive element. The ROC laboratory exercise was the result.
