## Rationale and Objectives

Heterogeneity of skeletal muscle structure, composition, and perfusion results in spatial differences in oxidative function between muscles and muscle regions. The simultaneous measurement of the postexercise phosphocreatine (PCr) recovery rate across all muscles of a human limb cross-section may provide new insights into normal physiology and disease states. The objective of this work was to assess the feasibility of acquiring PCr rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) images with sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to accurately measure PCr recovery kinetics in a cross-section of a human limb.

## Materials and Methods

One normal subject performed a finger exercise until fatigued. At cessation of exercise surface coil localized pulse-and-acquire phosphorus-31 MR spectra (  31 P- magnetic resonance spectroscopy \[MRS\]) of the forearm were acquired at 6 S intervals for 4 minutes. The exercise protocol was repeated 7 days later and axial PCr RARE images of the forearm were acquired following exercise with 5.6 cm  3 voxels at 6-second intervals for 4 minutes.

## Results

The PCr recovery time constants for the PCr RARE and  31 P-MRS measurements were 91.0 and 91.1 seconds, respectively, based on a monoexponential fit. A Pearson correlation test showed that the PCr recovery data that resulted from the RARE PCr imaging were highly correlated with the data resulting from the  31 P-MRS ( _r_ = 0.91, _P_ < .0001).

## Discussion

Data from selected regions of RARE PCr images acquired at 6-second intervals compare well to those acquired using surface coil  31 P MR spectroscopy and can provide an accurate assessment of PCr recovery kinetics.

Substantial variation in the biochemical properties, vascular supplies, and composition (eg, fiber type) among human skeletal muscles has been well-documented . These characteristics influence the mitochondrial capacity to varying degrees in different muscles in normal and athletically trained individuals . Further changes in these characteristics occur because of normal aging and some disease states, which may result in a heterogeneous pattern of altered metabolic function .

The rate of resynthesis of phosphocreatine (PCr) in skeletal muscle following exercise is an index of the capacity of the mitochondria to carry out oxidative metabolism . Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  31 P-MRS) with surface coil localization is an accepted method for measuring the postexercise recovery rate of skeletal muscle PCr and can provide insights into normal physiology and pathophysiology in disease states . A limitation of surface coil  31 P-MRS is that it does not provide precise spatial information and is limited to superficial muscle regions. It is also uncertain whether the acquired signal is from only a single muscle or from multiple muscles with different characteristics within the sensitive region of the surface coil . Current  31 P-MRS localization methods require times that are too long for the precise assessment of postexercise PCr recovery kinetics .

The position of the surface coil during the in vivo PCr recovery and phantom B1 map acquisitions was used to align the B1 map with the subject's anatomy to determine which portion of the sensitive region of the surface coil contributed to in vivo signal reception ( pixels blocked out with dark lines ).
