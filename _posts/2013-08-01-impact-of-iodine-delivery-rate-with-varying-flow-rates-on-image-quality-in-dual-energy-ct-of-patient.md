## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively compare four contrast material injection protocols for dual-energy computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (DE-CTPA) in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Materials and Methods

One hundred twenty consecutive patients were randomized to contrast material injection protocols defined by different iodine concentrations and iodine delivery rates (IDRs): (A) 80 mL iopromide 370/4 mL/sec = IDR 1.4 gI/sec; (B) 80 mL iopromide 370 at 3 mL/sec = IDR 1.1 gI/sec; (C) 98 mL iopromide 300 at 4.9 mL/sec = IDR 1.4 gI/sec; and (D) 98 mL iopromide 300 at 3.7 mL/sec = IDR 1.1 gI/sec. Attenuation values were measured in the inflow tract (subclavian vein–superior vena cava–right atrium), target tract (right ventricle–pulmonary trunk–pulmonary arteries), and outflow tract (left atrium–left ventricle–ascending aorta). Two readers assessed subjective image quality of CTPA images and iodine perfusion maps. The number of artifacts due to hyperdense contrast material on iodine perfusion maps was recorded.

## Results

Target tract attenuation was highest for protocol A with 374 ± 98 Hounsfield units (HU) (highly concentrated contrast material/high IDR). This was significant compared to protocols B and D ( _P_ = .0118, _P_ = .0427) but not compared to protocol C ( _P_ = .3395). No significant difference in target tract attenuation was found between protocols B (309 ± 80 HU), protocol C (352 ± 119 HU), and D (325 ± 74 HU). CTPA and iodine perfusion map image quality for protocol A was rated significantly higher compared to all other protocols (median score = 5/4; _P_ < .0001 for both) with moderate interreader agreement (κ = 0.58/0.47). Protocols A and B displayed increased artifacts on iodine perfusion maps compared to protocols C and D (3 versus 2).

## Conclusion

Despite increased artifacts on iodine perfusion maps, highly concentrated iodinated contrast material combined with high flow rates provides improved diagnostic image quality and has the highest target-tract attenuation for DE-CTPA protocols.

Diagnostic imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). In daily clinical routine, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of PE owing to its high spatial resolution, ready availability, and proven high diagnostic accuracy . CTPA allows for excellent diagnostic accuracy in detecting intravascular emboli in addition to providing valuable information concerning cardiopulmonary anatomy and pathology, including the presence of right ventricular dysfunction in patients with PE .

Dual-energy CT (DECT) examinations allow selective visualization of contrast material in tissues by taking advantage of the spectral properties of iodine . Thus, dual-energy CTPA (DE-CTPA) allows for a comprehensive pulmonary evaluation combining traditional CTPA for morphologic information and iodine-based perfusion maps for functional evaluation. The application of DE-CTPA in PE has shown promising results; however, all studies have reported a high incidence of contrast material–related beam-hardening artifacts . Beam-hardening artifacts may produce false-positive results or obscure true-positive findings. In turn, this limits both the sensitivity and the specificity of the technique . In an effort to enhance diagnostic quality of DE-CTPA scans, the contrast material delivery protocol has to be adjusted . DE-CTPA scans require a uniquely tailored protocol aimed at maximum pulmonary arterial and parenchymal enhancement while also minimizing contrast material–related beam hardening artifacts . In addition to a high attenuation in the large pulmonary arteries, a high attenuation of the pulmonary parenchyma is also required. Protocols strive to avoid high attenuation in the inflow vessels such as the subclavian vein and the superior vena cava to reduce beam-hardening artifacts.

Note that a high target tract attenuation in combination with a low inflow tract attenuation should indicate superior image quality.
