## Rationale and Objectives

Simulation-based training has been shown to be a useful adjunct to standard didactic lecture in teaching residents appropriate management of adverse contrast reactions. In addition, it has been suggested that a biannual refresher is needed; however, the type of refresher education has not been assessed.

## Materials and Methods

This was a prospective study involving 31 radiology residents across all years in a university program. All residents underwent standard didactic lecture followed by high-fidelity simulation-based training. At approximately 6 months, residents were randomized into a didactic versus simulation group for a refresher. At approximately 9 months, all residents returned to the simulation center for performance testing. Knowledge and confidence assessments were obtained from all participants before and after each phase. Performance testing was obtained at each simulation session and scored based on predefined critical actions.

## Results

There was significant improvement in knowledge ( _P_ < .002) and confidence ( _P_ < .001) after baseline education of combined didactic and simulation-based training. There was no statistical difference between the simulation and didactic groups in knowledge or confidence at any phase of the study. There was no significant difference in tested performance between the groups in either performance testing session.

## Conclusions

This study suggests that a curriculum consisting of an annual didactic lecture combined with simulation-based training followed by a didactic refresher at 6 months is an effective and efficient (both cost-effective and time-effective) method of educating radiology residents in the management of adverse contrast reactions.

Acute adverse reactions to contrast administration are rare events, estimated at an incidence of 0.2%–3.1% . These can range from mild and self-limiting to life-threatening reactions. Recent surveys of radiologists have shown that there is a deficiency in knowledge of epinephrine for the management of adverse contrast reactions with only 41–43% of radiologists providing the correct dose, route, and concentration of the drug . These findings have raised concern that standard didactic-based instruction may not be sufficient training in the management of adverse contrast reactions. The addition of simulation-based training has been shown to improve resident management of contrast reactions . More recent studies have determined that although there is improvement in knowledge and confidence in the management of adverse contrast reactions when a combined didactic and scenario-based curriculum is used, the effect of this training begins to decline after 6 months. This study suggests that biannual refresher training should be considered . What has not been studied to date is the type of training that should be provided at the 6-month refresher mark, didactic or simulation, and what effect the type of reinforcement has on resident performance in the management of adverse contrast reactions. The objective of this prospective randomized study was to determine if there is a difference in knowledge, confidence, and tested performance for managing adverse contrast reactions based on simulation versus didactic refresher courses.

## Materials and methods

This prospective study involved all radiology residents of postgraduate years 2–5 at a university program. Participation was voluntary, and written informed consent was obtained from each resident after the nature of the study was explained. Residents were assigned numbers to maintain their anonymity. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital.
