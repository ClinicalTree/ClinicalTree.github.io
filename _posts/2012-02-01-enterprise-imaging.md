To evaluate financial performance, academic radiology departments most often measure examination volume and general technical and professional expenses. Although these metrics are not standardized, their frequency of use reflects that productivity and financial health are high priorities for academic radiology departments across the United States. In this article, we discuss both of these topics, in the context of projects to expand services, particularly those with an information technology (IT) component. First, we discuss several informatics innovations that increase productivity or expand service. Second, we explain core financial analysis concepts applicable to radiology departments. Third, we discuss the unique challenge of evaluating a potential IT project for an academic radiology department, when intangible benefits are difficult to quantify. Financial models are only one of several components used for guidance in strategic decisions, but are crucial to building a business case that justifies the initial or capital investment as well as startup and ongoing operational expenses.

The academic medicine endeavor is traditionally described as a three-legged stool, metaphorically representing clinical practice, education, and research. A fourth leg, representing administrative responsibilities, recently has been recognized. These administrative responsibilities include evaluating a department's financial performance, which for radiology most often involves non-standardized metrics such as examination volume, and general technical and professional expenses . Because hospital managers often trust radiologists with decisions about technological innovations and their associated costs, workflow implications, and potential revenue, this fourth leg is particularly apparent among radiologists .

Dividing time appropriately among the different legs of the stool is essential. Therefore, time is a valuable resource that must be allocated and used efficiently. Many informatics tools exist to help academic radiology departments achieve this goal. For clinical practice, which constitutes the largest portion of time for most academic radiology faculty, there are picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) and, more recently, multisite and integrated work list tools. In the research realm, there are data-mining tools for radiology reports, and dedicated research PACS. For education, there are integrated and searchable electronic teaching files. Finally, for administration, business analytics tools and computer-based scheduling systems are relevant examples.

Deciding which informatics tools are worthwhile investments is challenging. In business, financial modeling aids such decisions. Previous publications have described financial modeling for decision-making in the context of private practice radiology . Most successful academic radiology departments also use financial modeling . To manage an academic radiology department, and to communicate with hospital and health center leaders, particularly in the current medical economy, academic radiology administrators must be financially articulate. In this article, we describe several informatics innovations that can increase productivity or market share. Then, we introduce basic financial modeling tools. Finally, we discuss their applications and limitations in the context of academic radiology departments.

## Information technology and radiology

Of all medical specialties, radiology historically has been the leader in implementing effective information technology (IT) solutions. Radiology information systems (RIS) and PACS are just the beginning of many innovations that IT offers radiologists to improve productivity. In fact, it has been suggested that every radiology practice designate a medical imaging informatics radiologist to facilitate adopting these technological advances .

Clinical information systems can be categorized into four broad categories based on what they improve: documentation and access to clinical information, communication, access to medical knowledge, and decision-making . In this article, systems for improving access to clinical information include PACS storage of outside images, web-based PACS, automated presentation of relevant priors, PACS integration with external work lists, and PACS integration with electronic medical records (EMRs). Tools for improving communication include multifacility common work lists and systems for notifying clinicians of subcritical findings. Although PACS storage of outside images and web-based PACS do not have an easily quantifiable impact on radiologist and referring physician productivity, they likely result in increased satisfaction among referring physicians, more accurate reports, and improved service. In contrast, the first group has a more direct impact on productivity. IT innovations that improve access to medical knowledge and decision support are beyond the scope of this article, but examples relevant to radiology include PACS integration with a resource such as STATdx (Amirsys, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT ©2011) and a RIS that alerts the radiologist when protocoling a contrast-enhanced study for a patient with a known contrast allergy (  Table 1 ).

where CF is the cash flow, CF  0 is the initial investment, CF _t_ is the cash flow (revenue − expenses) for the period at time _t_ , _r_ is the discount rate, and _T_ is the number of time periods over which the model is being projected. Note that because CF  0 is the initial investment, it is a negative number. Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) has an NPV function that performs these calculations, given a discount rate and a set of cash flows. As a simple example, we can calculate the NPV for the same CT scanner used in the payback method example, assuming a discount rate of 8% and a project lifetime of 7 years (  Table 3 ). An additional example including investment, cash flows, and expenses is shown in  Table 4 , assuming a discount rate of 5% and a project lifetime of 4 years. In finance, the NPV rule states that a project should be accepted if it has a positive NPV for a given discount rate . Thus, based on this financial model, we should purchase the CT scanner in both examples. The CT scanner is used here as the example for how to apply the NPV method because it produces concrete cash flows; an example using an IT project investment will be discussed later in this article.
