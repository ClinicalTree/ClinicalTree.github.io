## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of being forewarned that they would be asked to identify repeated images on radiologists' recognition of previously interpreted versus new chest radiographs.

## Materials and Methods

Thirteen radiologists viewed 60 posterior-anterior chest radiographs, 31 with and 29 without nodules, in two sets of 40 images each. Eight radiologists were forewarned and five radiologists were not forewarned of the memory task. Twenty images in each of the two sets were unique to each set and 20 images occurred in both sets. The readers indicated the presence or absence of any nodules during both readings, and in the second reading session they also indicated whether they thought each image had also occurred in the first reading.

## Results

There was no significant difference in recognition memory performance between forewarned and not-forewarned readers. Overall accuracy in distinguishing previously-viewed from new images was 60.7%.

## Conclusions

Being forewarned of the memory task did not improve recognition memory.

Imaging researchers commonly compare two different imaging techniques or viewing situations by having radiologists read two or more sets of images and then comparing their accuracy with one set versus another. Most authors use various techniques to avoid bias attributable to memory—in other words, to prevent the observers from recognizing the images in the second set and linking them to images in the first set, so that each set of interpretations is made as independently of the other as possible. Common methods include waiting for a predetermined period of time between readings, showing the images in different order at the separate readings, and counterbalancing the viewings, so that, in an example in which two different conditions are being tested, equal numbers of readers encounter condition A first and B second versus B first and A second.

Creating a time lapse between readings increases the time required to complete a performance study, and depending on when, where, and with what readers a study is carried out, there may be distinct practical limits to how much time can pass between readings. There has been little advice regarding such time lapses in the published literature. Charles Metz advised that researchers wait as long as possible between readings . In practice, the time allowed to elapse between readings can vary dramatically. Graf et al waited 2 days between readings in a pulmonary nodule detection task, while Fuhrman et al waited 2 years between readings in a rib fracture detection study . There has been relatively little work exploring the actual memory of radiologists for medical images that they have encountered, although four articles have suggested that recognition memory for radiographs by radiologists may be fairly limited .
