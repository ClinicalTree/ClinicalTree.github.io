## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare accuracy between semiautomated and manual measurements of the longest diameter and volume of simulated hepatic tumors in phantoms and to evaluate the effects of slice thickness (ST) and reconstruction increment (RI) on accuracy.

## Materials and Methods

Liver phantoms with 45 hypoattenuating and 45 hyperattenuating lesions of different sizes (diameter, 13.3–50.7 mm; volume, 0.4–54.0 mm  3 ) and shapes (spherical or elliptical) were scanned using a 64-row multidetector computed tomographic scanner. Images were reconstructed with ST and RI settings of 0.75 and 0.7 mm, 1.0 and 0.7 mm, 1.5 and 1.0 mm, 3.0 and 2.0 mm, 3.0 and 3.0 mm, and 5.0 and 5.0 mm. The longest diameter and volume of each lesion were measured both manually and semiautomatically. To assess accuracy, measurements were compared to reference values by calculating absolute percentage error. Comparisons of absolute percentage error between methods and between ST and RI settings were performed using paired _t_ tests. The degree of correlation between each measurement and a reference value was also assessed.

## Results

The semiautomated method showed significantly higher accuracy than the manual method in volume for most ST and RI settings (0.75 and 0.7 mm, 1.0 and 0.7 mm, and 1.5 and 1.0 mm in hypoattenuating lesions and all settings in hyperattenuating lesions; _P_ < .05) and showed similar accuracy in diameter for all ST and RI settings regardless of lesion attenuation ( _P_ \> .05). Semiautomated measurements also demonstrated higher correlation with reference values than the manual method for both diameter and volume. The absolute percentage error tended to be increased as ST and RI increased for both methods, and acceptable maximum ST and RI in semiautomated method were 1.5 and 1.0 mm.

## Conclusions

Semiautomated computed tomographic measurement showed higher accuracy and correlation than the manual method in measuring the diameter and volume of hepatic lesions. The accuracy of both methods was highly dependent on z-axis resolution.

Monitoring tumor response to treatment is an integral and increasingly important function of radiologists’ working in the field of oncology. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which are based on measuring the longest axial diameters of solid target lesions, are the current standard for the assessment of therapeutic tumor response . However, recent evidence suggests that the value of RECIST may lead to remarkable interobserver variance in manual measurements . Therefore, many imaging experts have asserted that state-of-the-art multidetector row computed tomographic (MDCT) imaging, which facilitates the acquisition and analysis of high–spatial resolution three-dimensional data sets, will provide more accurate assessment of lesion dimensions . In addition, the International Cancer Imaging Society advocated modifications to RECIST in a consensus paper to compensate for such shortcomings and opted for the incorporation of volumetric scanning techniques such as MDCT and three-dimensional volume measurement approaches.

The utility of semiautomated measurement for liver, lung, and lymph node lesions has already been substantiated in several studies . However, no previous study has compared accuracy in measuring hepatic lesions between the semiautomated method and the manual method with reference standards or suggested appropriate slice thickness (ST) and reconstruction increment (RI) settings for accurate measurement.
