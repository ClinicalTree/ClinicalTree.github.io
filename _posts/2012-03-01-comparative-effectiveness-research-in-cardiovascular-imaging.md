In times of contracting resources in health care, demands are being voiced ever louder that all components of current medical care pass the litmus test of comparative effectiveness. In the wake of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a council was created and tasked with fostering comparative effectiveness and related health services research . This Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research defines comparative effectiveness research as the conduct and synthesis of systematic research comparing different interventions and strategies to prevent, diagnose, treat, and monitor health conditions . The council proposed the following criteria for scientifically meritorious comparative effectiveness research:

- 1.
potential impact (on the basis of prevalence of condition, burden of disease, variability in outcomes, and costs of care);

- 2.

- 3.
