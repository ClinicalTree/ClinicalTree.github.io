_Practical Differential Diagnosis for CT and MRI_ by Lin et al is self-described as a “one-stop resource for the differential diagnosis of common and rare radiologic findings,” stating that it provides a complete list of differential diagnoses for each finding and diagnoses that are included. The principal target audience of the book appears to be residents in training, although the authors indicate that the book would also be of use as a reference for practicing radiologists. Because I would be included in the first group, I thought it would be most useful to apply the book to the daily study review at the workstation. Overall, the book does well with regard to content, providing multiple tables and lists that are easy to use.

The book's setup is simple. The table of contents is essentially system based, with initial divisions that align well with radiology subspecialties. These divisions include the brain, head and neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, musculoskeletal, and spine, with further subdivisions and individual chapters. The subdivisions and ultimately the individual chapters were likely more difficult to create, simply because of the inherent difficulty of categorization in radiology. Simply stated, although the classification of pathologic findings can be organized into subgroups on the basis of anatomic location, disease etiology, or radiologic findings, Lin et al seem to have used a combination of these subgroups to create their chapters rather than a single systematic approach. Specifically, the subdivisions are sometimes anatomically based (“Salivary Gland”), sometimes based on etiology (“Carcinomas and Neoplasms,” “Infection”), and sometimes based on radiographic finding only (“Patterns and Signs”). This is important to note, so that when using this text, one might consider looking beyond the subdivision “Tumor and Tumor-Like Lesions” to “Infection” when considering a diagnosis of enhancing central nervous system lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus, for example. The chapter titled “Intracranial Manifestations of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,” in subdivision “Infection,” provides a detailed review of differences in imaging findings between human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and a review of differences between toxoplasmosis and lymphoma. The chapter titled “Peripherally Enhancing Cystic Brain Lesions,” in the subdivision “Tumor and Tumor-Like Lesions,” provides a more general comparison of the differences between neoplasm and abscess.

I am not sure that the chapter setup could be much better arranged without the use of an active format such as an interactive program, and this likely due to the inherent difficulties of categorization in our specialty. The only other area in which I would recommend some attention is the consideration of artifactual findings as mimickers of real disease. The most beneficial aspect of the chapter setup is that the chapters are designed as brief summaries. Many reference books can be cumbersome, but this is designed as a paperback that can be easily transported. Make no mistake, this book does not go into details of pathology; instead, it sticks to imaging characteristics and lists of differential diagnoses, as advertised.
