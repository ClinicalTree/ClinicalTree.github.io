## Rationale and Objectives

Benefits of iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms combined with dose-reduction techniques have been shown at computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in several medium to small patient collectives. In this study, we performed a systematic comparison of image quality to combinations of reduced tube current (RC) and IR for both standard-pitch (SP) single-source and high-pitch (HP) dual-source CTPA in a large, single-center population.

## Materials and Methods

Three hundred eighty-two consecutive patients (October 2010 through December 2012) received clinically indicated CTPA with one of four consecutively changed protocols: (1) _HP  SC_ : 180 mAs, weighted filtered back projection, pitch = 3; (2) _HP  RC_ : 90 mAs, IR, pitch = 3; (3) _SP  SC_ : 180 mAs, weighted filtered back projection, pitch = 1.2; and (4) _HP  RC_ : 90 mAs, IR, pitch = 1.2. Tube potential was 100 kV. Vascular attenuation and standardized signal-to-noise ratio (sSNR) were measured in the pulmonary trunk (sSNR  PT ) and on segmental artery level (sSNR  S1 , sSNR  S10 ). Dose-length-product was recorded per series. Two independent investigators rated image quality. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and kappa statistics were used for statistical analysis. Median values are presented per group.

## Results

Image quality was consistent between all groups (observer 1: _P_ = 0.118; observer 2: _P_ = 0.122). Inter-reader consistency was very good (κ = 0.866, _P_ < 0.001). Dose-length-product was significantly reduced in HP and RC groups ( _P_ < 0.001 for each; _SP  SC_ : 139.5 mGycm; _HP  RC_ : 92 mGycm; _SP  SC_ : 211 mGycm; _HP  RC_ : 137 mGycm). sSNR was comparable (sSNR  PT overall: _P_ = 0.052; sSNR  S1 overall: _P_ = 0.161; and sSNR  S10 overall: _P_ = 0.259).

## Conclusions

Substantial dose reduction can be within a routine clinical setting without quantifiable loss of image quality either by HP pulmonary angiography or by a combination of IR and RC in either HP or SP acquisition.

## Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is considered the third most common cause of acute cardiovascular disease, accounting for 5–10% of hospital deaths in the United States . Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been established as the first-line imaging modality and the standard of care imaging test for the diagnosis of PE . CTPA is noninvasive, has a high sensitivity and specificity, is widely available, cost-effective, and can simultaneously evaluate a variety of differential diagnoses . Depending on successful evaluation of pretest likelihood, incidence of PE on CT angiography (CTA) is 5–15% . Thus, the number of patients receiving ionizing radiation in CTPA for suspected PE with a negative test result is far in excess of the true-positive cases. In addition, several studies have been suggesting that in clinical routine, inadequate pretest screening negatively impacts this percentage . Increasing use of CTPA has therefore led to continuous efforts to optimize standard CTPA protocols and thus reduce the radiation dose (RD) of CTPA while maintaining image quality .

In recent years, several technical advances at CT have enabled significant reduction of RD at CTPA . Among these, tube voltage reduction from 120 kV to 100 kV can lower radiation exposure by 50% alone . High-pitch (HP) protocols with pitch values up to 3.4 are available on dual-source CT scanners through use of simultaneous data acquisition from both x-ray tubes and detectors. This can reduce RD on the order of 30% . Model-based iterative reconstruction algorithms substantially reduce image noise and are therefore ideal for use in combination with low-dose acquisitions . Because of the increasing use of CTPA, implementation of these dose-saving techniques in standard clinical protocols has become a relevant factor to reduce medical radiation exposure . Benefits of individual protocol changes have been well demonstrated in medium- and small-size patient populations. However, a systematic confirmation of a combination of these dose-reduction techniques against standard dose protocols in both dual-source and single-source acquisitions on a large sample population in a routine clinical setting has not yet been reported.
