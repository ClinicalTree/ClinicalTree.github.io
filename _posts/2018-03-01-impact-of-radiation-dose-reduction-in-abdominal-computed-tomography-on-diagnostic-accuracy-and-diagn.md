## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the intraindividual impact of radiation dose reduction in abdominal computed tomography (CT) on diagnostic performance in patients with suspected appendicitis.

## Materials and Methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board. Seventy-five patients who underwent standard contrast-enhanced abdominal CT for suspected appendicitis between 2004 and 2009 were retrospectively included. Low-dose CT reconstructions with 75%, 50%, and 25% of the original radiation dose level were generated by applying realistic reduced-dose simulation. Two blinded, independent readers assessed image quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and diagnostic confidence on each dataset. Diagnostic accuracy for detection of appendicitis and complications were calculated for each reader. Paired univariate tests were used to determine intraindividual differences.

## Results

Among 75 subjects included in the analysis (57% female, mean age: 41 ± 18 years), the prevalence of histopathologically confirmed appendicitis was 59%. Signal-to-noise ratio and subjective image quality of 50% and 25% reduced-dose CTs were significantly lower than the reference datasets (all _P_ < .005). Appendicitis was correctly identified in all reference and low-dose datasets (sensitivity: 100%, negative predictive value: 100%). Presence of complications was correctly detected in all reference, 75%, and 50% datasets, but was decreased in 25% datasets (sensitivity: 77.8% and negative predictive value: 97.4%). Diagnostic confidence was high for original and 75% datasets, but significantly lower for 50% and 25% datasets ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Our results indicate that diagnostic accuracy in abdominal CT acquisitions acquired at 75% and 50% of radiation dose is maintained in patients with suspected appendicitis, whereas further reduction of radiation exposition is associated with decreased diagnostic performance.

## Introduction

Acute appendicitis is one of the most frequent diagnoses in acute nontraumatic abdominal pain, affecting mostly patients in the second and third decade of life, with a cumulative lifetime risk of 9.0% . Established clinical signs, laboratory blood values, and transabdominal ultrasound may help in confirming or excluding the diagnosis of appendicitis; however, several studies underline the predominant benefit of computed tomography (CT) compared to ultrasound in the diagnostic workup, with excellent sensitivity and negative predictive value . Additionally, previous research reported a decline in negative appendectomy rates, which can be attributed to the use of CT in the diagnostic management of appendicitis .

Taking into consideration that patients in whom appendicitis is suspected are often young adults or children, the exposure to ionizing radiation is of particular concern, and CT protocols with reduced radiation exposure are mandatory. Although low-dose CT protocols are often associated with a decrease in image quality and thus potential deterioration of diagnostic accuracy, several studies demonstrated no hampering of diagnostic performance for detection of appendicitis in low-dose CT compared to standard-dose CT . Kim et al. also reported that low-dose CT is noninferior to standard-dose CT with respect to negative appendectomy rates (3.5% vs 3.2%, respectively) . However, these and other studies on low-dose CT in patients with appendicitis are based on between-group comparisons without intraindividual reference and without taking into account associated conditions and complications, which may explain the limited implementation of these low-dose CT protocols in clinical practice.
