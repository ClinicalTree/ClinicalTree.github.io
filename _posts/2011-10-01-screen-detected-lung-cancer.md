## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate characteristics of lung cancers diagnosed in a low-dose computed tomographic lung cancer screening study.

## Materials and Methods

As part of the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program, a cohort of 4782 at-risk participants were screened. A total of 86 cancers in 84 individuals were detected and evaluated for location, morphology (density, border), size, histology, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and survival. Follow-up imaging for computation of growth rates was available in 41 cases.

## Results

Eighty-six cancers were detected in 84 individuals (60 women, 24 men). Of these, seven (8%) were incidence cancers. Most cancers were radiologically described as solid ( _n_ = 52 \[61%\]). The median tumor size was 18 × 13 mm (range, 6–56 mm). Histopathologic diagnoses revealed 10 (11.6%) bronchoalveolar carcinomas, 55 (64%) adenocarcinomas, 11 (12.8%) squamous-cell carcinomas, two (2.3%) large-cell carcinomas, three (3.5%) carcinoids, and five (5.8%) small-cell lung cancers. Of the 41 cases with follow-up computed tomographic scans, 36 nodules had increased in size. The mean doubling time for all cancers was 259 days (median, 154 days). In women ( _n_ = 25), the mean doubling time was 313 days (median, 156 days), while in men ( _n_ = 11), the mean doubling time was 137 days (median, 92 days). Overall, 55 lung cancers (68%) were stage I. Most cancers ( _n_ = 62 \[73%\]) were surgically resected.

## Conclusions

In this cohort, screening detected lung cancer in early treatable stages, and women had more slow-growing adenocarcinomas than men. Most screen-detected lung cancers were surgically resectable.

Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been performed in research studies all over the world . Although the impact on mortality remains the primary outcome of randomized trials in the United States and Europe , there is consensus that screening with LDCT detects early-stage lung cancers in asymptomatic at-risk individuals . Our institution is part of the multicenter International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP), a single-arm study in which baseline and annual repeat LDCT has been performed in >4500 individuals . It has been discussed that screen-detected lung cancers differ from the general pool of lung cancers in their morphology, histology, and prognosis . There are several open questions regarding the implementation of a lung cancer screening algorithm, for example concerning the optimal screening interval and the overdiagnosis of lung cancers. We retrospectively analyzed both morphologic characteristics (ie, the computed tomographic \[CT\] appearance) and biologic characteristics (ie, the growth rate) of one of the largest series of screen-detected lung cancers published to date. Assessing the imaging appearances and temporal changes of screen-detected lung cancers provides information on which cancers might be subject to overdiagnosis.

## Materials and methods

## Study Participants

As part of the I-ELCAP, we have performed lung cancer screening since September 2003. Enrollment criteria are age ≥ 50 years, smoking history of ≥10 pack-years, no prior cancer (except nonmelanotic skin cancers), and general good health (to undergo further treatment if a lung cancer is found). At the time of this analysis, 4782 individuals were enrolled, 2630 (55%) women and 2152 (45%) men. The study was approved by our local research ethics boards, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
