## Purpose

To determine interreader agreement and diagnostic accuracy across varying levels of reader experience using qualitative and quantitative methods of evaluating adrenal nodules using (  18 F)-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography/computed tomography.

## Methods

132 adrenal nodules (96 adenomas, 36 metastases) were retrospectively identified in 105 patients (49 men and 56 women, mean age 66 years, age range 45–85 years) with a history of lung cancer who underwent (  18 F)-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography/computed tomography. For each nodule, three readers independently performed one qualitative and two quantitative measurements: visual assessment, standardized uptake value (SUV  max ), and standard uptake ratio (SUV  ratio ). Interreader agreement was calculated using percent agreement with κ statistic for qualitative analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for quantitative analysis. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal nodules were calculated for each method.

## Results

Percent agreement between readers for visual (qualitative) assessment was 92% to 96% and κ statistic was 0.79 to 0.90 (95% confidence limits 0.66–0.99). ICC for SUV  max was 92% to 99% (95% CL 0.8–1.0), and ICC for SUV  ratio was 89% to 99% (95% CL 0.74–0.99). For diagnosis of malignancy, mean sensitivity and specificity for visual assessment were 80% and 97%, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificity for SUV  max were 91% and 81%, respectively; for SUV  ratio , 90% and 80%. Mean diagnostic accuracy was 93%, 83%, and 84% for visual assessment, SUV  max , and SUV  ratio , respectively.

## Conclusion

Excellent interreader agreement is seen for quantitative and qualitative methods of distinguishing benign from malignant adrenal nodules. Qualitative analysis demonstrated higher accuracy but lower sensitivity compared with quantitative analysis.

In patients with primary lung malignancy, distinguishing adrenal adenomas from metastases is critical in determining stage of disease, guiding therapy, and predicting prognosis. While the traditional imaging methods of computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to characterize the majority of adrenal nodules, an increasing number of cancer patients are undergoing (  18 F)-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and combined FDG-PET/CT for staging of their primary malignancy. Because of the ability of FDG-PET to detect the increased uptake of radiolabeled glucose associated with adrenal metastases, FDG-PET/CT has emerged as another technique for distinguishing adrenal adenomas from adrenal metastases .

Studies investigating the utility of FDG-PET/CT for characterization of adrenal nodules have accuracies ranging between 75% and 100% . These variable results likely reflect the behavior of some adenomas to demonstrate moderate FDG uptake leading to a false-positive diagnosis of malignancy .
