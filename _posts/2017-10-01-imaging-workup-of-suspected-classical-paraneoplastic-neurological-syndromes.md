## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to assess the clinical efficacy of positron emission tomography (PET) or combined PET-computed tomography (CT) with  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for whole-body cancer screening in patients with suspected paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS). The following main research questions were addressed: What is the percentage of positive findings to be expected in whole-body FDG-PET-CT in adult patients with PNS? How many false positives can be expected as assessed by clinical and histopathological workup? Are there patients who present with a tumor despite initially negative findings?

## Materials and Methods

This is a systematic review of the literature and retrospective analysis of FDG-PET-CT and clinical follow-up data from 45 consecutive patients (age: 56.6 ± standard deviation 15.8 years, 14 female, 31 male). Suspicious lesions were identified and correlated with immediate workup and clinical follow-up.

## Results

Fourteen studies were included in the review. Eleven malignancies (24.4% of patients) were identified by FDG-PET-CT in this sample. This is a higher percentage of positive findings compared to most previous reports. There was one initially negative finding.

## Conclusions

Whole-body FDG-PET-CT is suitable to identify additional malignancies in patients with suspected classical PNS referred to a tertiary medical center. The utility by means of true-positive findings is higher in classical PNS than suggested by studies in less select patient populations.

## Introduction

Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are rare, often subacutely manifesting conditions associated with malignant neoplasms. PNS are not directly caused by the tumor itself, metastases, metabolic derangement, or treatment effects. They are hypothesized to be immune-mediated disorders, and a range of associated autoantibodies have been characterized accordingly . Standardized diagnostic criteria for PNS have been introduced and widely adopted. They differentiate between classical and nonclassical PNS . A clinically diagnosed classical PNS with a high concentration of characteristic antineuronal antibodies is associated with a high probability of an underlying malignancy .

Because of the indirect nature of disease mechanisms and a potential tumor-suppressive effect of the autoimmune reaction, these tumors are often small . Therefore, diagnostic techniques to identify potentially underlying neoplasms have to provide sufficient sensitivity. A multimodal workup guided by the probability of tumor location has been recommended as first-line diagnostic approach . However, in recent years, positron emission tomography (PET) with  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) with or without simultaneous contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as a whole-body screening method, particularly in patients with PNS and negative findings in conventional cancer screening . A recent meta-analysis on PET and PET-CT in paraneoplastic syndromes in general (including PNS) has come to the conclusion that the overall accuracy is high in this setting . Evidence of diagnostic accuracy of PET-CT and a potential impact on outcomes in patients with suspected PNS is limited by small sample sizes and a distinct heterogeneity of studies featuring various outcome measures, reference standards, and clinical end points reflecting the rarity of these disorders.
