We rate radiology practices in all sorts of different ways—the number of radiologists they employ, the number of examinations they perform, total revenue, and so on. Based on such parameters, we can determine the largest practices, the busiest practices, and the most profitable practices.

However, the measurable aspects of a radiology practice tell only part of the story. There are many aspects of an organization's performance that do not lend themselves to measurement. In this discussion, we refer to these nonmeasurable aspects of an organization as its culture—the aspirations, vision, and patterns of thought and action that characterize an organization .

We believe that if we neglect culture in assessing the quality and performance of radiology organizations, we will inevitably end up with an incomplete and perhaps even distorted picture. In the following, we outline three key components of culture and their respective implications for the assessment of radiology organizations.

It is important to say at the outset that the concept of culture has a meaning and significance that extends far beyond assessment. Today, most organizational assessments tend to focus on what an organization is—a radiology department—and how well the organization is doing what such organizations do—performing and interpreting radiological examinations.
