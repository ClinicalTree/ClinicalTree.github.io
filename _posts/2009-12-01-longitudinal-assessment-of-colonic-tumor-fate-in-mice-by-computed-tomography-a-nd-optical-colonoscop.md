## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative merits of micro-computed tomograph colonography (mCTC) and optical colonoscopy (OC) for longitudinal studies of colonic tumors in mice.

## Materials and Methods

Colonic tumors in mice carrying the _Min_ allele of _Apc_ were followed over several weeks using mCTC and OC. A total of 146 colonic tumors were monitored: 62 in 32 untreated Min mice, 53 in 43 Min mice treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and 31 in 17 Min mice treated with piroxicam.

## Results

Colonic tumors in Min mice had three different spontaneous fates: 29 grew, 24 remained static, and 9 regressed. Treating Min mice with 5-FU increased the percentage of regressing tumors from 15% to 58%. The response was dependent in part on the initial size of the tumor. By contrast, treating Min mice with piroxicam did not alter colonic tumor fate.

## Conclusions

mCTC and OC can be used to determine the spontaneous fates of colonic tumors in mice and to document their individual responses to treatment. The ability to follow individually annotated colonic tumors reduces the number of mice needed for testing.

Murine models of human colorectal cancer afford investigators the opportunity to rapidly test newly developed treatments. The _Apc  Min/+_ (Min) mouse carries a nonsense mutation in codon 850 of the _Adenomatous polyposis coli_ ( _Apc_ ) gene and develops benign adenomas along the entire length of the intestinal tract . This model has been used over the past 18 years to test at least 269 treatments, including dietary supplements, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and exercise . For example, Jacoby et al exposed 15 Min mice to 100 ppm piroxicam via the diet for 42 days . Tumor multiplicity in a 4-cm segment of the distal small intestine was reduced from 10 ± 2 to 2 ± 1. This protective effect of piroxicam in the small intestine has been confirmed in several independent studies .

A limitation of genetic mouse models for human colon cancer is that tumors develop primarily in the small intestine instead of the colon . The low multiplicity of colonic tumors leads to the need for large experimental cohorts of mice for statistical significance in studies with a traditional cross-sectional design. This limitation can be overcome by longitudinally monitoring individually annotated colonic tumors in mice, where the statistical power depends on the ability to monitor the tumor response rather than on tumor multiplicity. In vivo imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed tomograph colonography (mCTC), and optical colonoscopy (OC) may provide complementary tools to monitor longitudinally the biology and therapeutics of colonic tumors .

![Figure 3, Tumor fate is affected by a single cycle of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or multiple cycles of 5-FU, but not piroxicam. Mice were scanned before treatment (Day 0) and immediately prior to sacrifice. Tumor fate following treatment with 5-FU was affected by initial volume: <5 mm 3 (left) and >5 mm 3 (right) . Regression (dotted lines) and growth (solid lines) are defined by a 16% (95% confidence level) or more decrease or increase in tumor volume, respectively. In the panel for controls with initial volume >5 mm 3 , two of the lines for regressing tumors overlap; there were four regressing tumors in this set.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LongitudinalAssessmentofColonicTumorFateinMicebyComputedTomographyandOpticalColonoscopy/2_1s20S1076633209004279.jpg)
