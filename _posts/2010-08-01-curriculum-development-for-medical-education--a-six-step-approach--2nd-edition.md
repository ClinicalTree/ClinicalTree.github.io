The second edition of The Johns Hopkins University Press's outstanding book _Curriculum Development for Medical Education: A Six-Step Approach_ is a tour-de-force and a voyage of discovery, and I very much enjoyed the trip. I did not have the pleasure of reading the first edition and thus will not address changes in the interval.

This book is exceptionally well written, organized, indexed, referenced, readable, and portable. The majority of the book centers on the authors' step-by-step suggested methodology for formulating a curriculum relating to medical education. Although there is an emphasis on learners in medical school and in graduate medical education, there is discussion of use in additional postgraduate education. Many tables, lists, and charts as well as examples (many taking the form of vignettes) not only complement the primary text but also provide a break from the very high-yield structure and flow of the chapters.

Indeed, I envision that this book could serve as a treasured introduction, primary resource, and then reference for any educators in the realms of medicine who are involved in the design, implementation, and/or assessment of their educational systems. An obvious target audience for this would be lead administrators in charge of educational programs, but I also feel that this book could be quite useful to other educators as well.

In the interest of full disclosure, I have not yet tried to use the six-step program outlined in the book. Thus, I cannot comment as to whether it “works” for me. That said, I am quite interested in finding out and am more than a little bit optimistic about its chances.
