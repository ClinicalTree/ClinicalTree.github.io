## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to determine if locoregional restaging with diagnostic mammography and ultrasound (US) of the whole breast and regional nodes performed for quality assurance in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer who were referred to a tertiary care center yields incremental cancer detection.

## Materials and Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective, single-institution database review was performed on the first 1000 women referred to our center in 2010 with a provisional breast cancer diagnosis. Locoregional restaging consisted of diagnostic full-field digital mammography combined with US of the whole breast and regional nodal basins. Bilateral whole-breast US was performed in women with contralateral mammographic abnormality or had heterogeneously or extremely dense parenchyma. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic factors were analyzed.

## Results

Final analyses included 401 women. Of the 401 women, 138 (34%) did not have their outside images available for review upon referral. The median age was 54 years (range 21–92); the median tumor size was 2.9 cm (range 0.6–18.0) for women whose disease was upstaged and 2.2 cm (range 0.4–15.0) for women whose disease was not upstaged. Incremental cancer detection rates were 15.5% (62 of 401) in the ipsilateral breast and 3.9% (6 of 154) in the contralateral breast ( _P_ < 0.0001). The total upstage rate was 25% (100 of 401). Surgical management changed from segmentectomy to mastectomy in 12% (50 of 401). The re-excision rate after segmentectomy was 19% (35 of 189).

## Conclusions

Locoregional restaging with diagnostic mammography combined with whole-breast and regional nodal US that is performed for standardization of the imaging workup for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients can reduce underestimation of disease burden and impact therapeutic planning.

## Introduction

Locoregional staging of breast cancer is performed not only to determine the primary tumor size (T stage) and the regional nodal status (N stage), but also to identify additional foci of malignancy and to delineate the extent of disease to facilitate optimal treatment. The primary tumor size and the regional nodal status are important prognostic indicators. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is offered to women with node-positive or aggressive disease (ie, triple-negative or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive \[HER2+\] subtypes) or large tumors. Defining the extent of the disease aids surgical planning and helps determine the appropriateness of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) vs mastectomy. The clinical N stage, which is based in part on imaging data, guides adjuvant radiation planning.

The standard of care for initial staging of breast cancer is imaging with mammography. The most common adjunct modalities to mammography are ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The use of breast US varies from whole breast to mammographic- or MRI-directed, targeted breast US. Additionally, the use of US to examine nodal basins has not been universally adopted. When regional nodes are examined using US, some centers evaluate only the axilla and other centers evaluate all regional nodal basins of the breast, including the axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, and supraclavicular regions. Despite reports in literature showing that MRI can identify additional disease in both the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts, the use of breast MRI for staging remains practice dependent . Controversy remains regarding benefits of preoperative breast MRI as measured by rates of re-excision, recurrence, and survival .
