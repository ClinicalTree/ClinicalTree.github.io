## Rationale and Objectives

The level of Tc-99m sestamibi uptake within normal fibroglandular tissue on molecular breast imaging (MBI), termed background parenchymal uptake (BPU), has been anecdotally observed to fluctuate with menstrual cycle. Our objective was to assess the impact of menstrual cycle phase on BPU appearance.

## Materials and Methods

Premenopausal volunteers who reported regular menstrual cycles and no exogenous hormone use were recruited to undergo serial MBI examinations during the follicular and luteal phase. A study radiologist, blinded to cycle phase, categorized BPU as photopenic, minimal mild, moderate, or marked. Change in BPU with cycle phase was determined, as well as correlations of BPU with mammographic density and hormone levels.

## Results

In 42 analyzable participants, high BPU (moderate or marked) was observed more often in luteal phase compared to follicular ( _P_ = .016). BPU did not change with phase in 30 of 42 participants (71%) and increased in the luteal phase compared to follicular in 12 (29%). High BPU was more frequent in dense breasts compared to nondense breasts at both the luteal (58% \[15 of 26\] vs. 13% \[2 of 16\], _P_ = .004) and follicular phases (35% \[9 of 26\] vs. 6% \[1 of 16\], _P_ = .061). Spearman correlation coefficients did not show any correlation of BPU with hormone levels measured at either cycle phase and suggested a weak correlation between change in BPU and changes in estrone and estradiol between phases.

## Conclusions

We observed variable effects of menstrual cycle on BPU among our cohort of premenopausal women; however, when high BPU was observed, it was most frequently seen during the luteal phase compared to follicular phase and in women with dense breasts compared to nondense breasts.

Changes in radiologic appearance of the breast due to changes in hormonal milieu across phases of the menstrual cycle have been described for multiple imaging modalities, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound, optical imaging, and nuclear medicine technologies . These menstrual cycle effects have important clinical implications. Timing imaging during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle has been shown to improve diagnostic performance for both mammography and breast MRI . In addition, variation in the magnitude of cyclic changes on breast radiologic appearance between women is thought to reflect differences in hormonal responsiveness of breast tissue, which in turn has been hypothesized as a potential differentiator of breast cancer risk . By this theory, the more variant the appearance of the breast on imaging at different stages of the menstrual cycle, the more hormonally responsive the breast tissue and the higher the breast cancer risk.

Molecular breast imaging (MBI) is a functional imaging technique that uses a dedicated gamma camera to image preferential uptake of Tc-99m sestamibi in cells with elevated metabolic activity. MBI and similar techniques using Tc-99m sestamibi have been shown to detect breast tumors, particularly those occult on mammography because of radiographically dense tissue . MBI can also demonstrate uptake in normal parenchyma, which has been termed background parenchymal uptake (BPU) . In the screening setting, we have observed variability in BPU among women with similar mammographic densities, ranging from photopenic (less-intense uptake within fibroglandular tissue compared to that in subcutaneous fat) to marked (uptake in fibroglandular tissue more than twice as intense as that in fat), suggesting that MBI depicts properties of breast parenchymal function that are not readily appreciated by the anatomic depiction of fibroglandular tissue on mammography.
