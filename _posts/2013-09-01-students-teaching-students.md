## Rationale and Objectives

Teaching is an important skill. Academic physicians teach on a daily basis, and nearly all physicians occasionally teach colleagues and patients. There are generally few opportunities for medical students to learn teaching skills. We developed a novel “near-peer” teaching program in which fourth-year students cotaught first-year students.

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen fourth-year students enrolled in our institution's primary senior radiology elective learned the basics of ultrasound through a series of lectures and hands-on scanning sessions. Each fourth-year student, paired with a radiology resident or attending, then cotaught a first-year anatomy small group session. After instruction, voluntary surveys were administered to assess the perceived value of the “near-peer” teaching experience.

## Results

Seventeen of 18 (94%) and 104 of 120 (87%) administered surveys were returned by fourth- and first-year students, respectively. Sixteen (94%) and 99 (95%) of the fourth- and first-year students reported they “enjoyed” or “really enjoyed” the near-peer teaching experience. Fourteen (82%) of the fourth years perceived improvement in their teaching skills and an increase in their knowledge. Only 8 (47%) of the fourth years thought they were “helpful” or “very helpful,” though 92 (88%) of the first years identified their fourth-year co-instructors as “helpful” or “very helpful.”

## Conclusions

We piloted a novel “near-peer” program. Both senior and freshman students enjoyed the experience, and fourth years thought the session was educational for them as well. Although most fourth years did not judge themselves as helpful, first-year students overwhelmingly considered them a useful addition to the session.

Physicians almost universally benefit from being able to teach; some physicians directly teach as part of their regular duties and nearly all physicians have occasion to teach colleagues and patients. Although teaching skills are important, formal education on how to teach is generally lacking throughout medical school and postgraduate training .

Students teaching other students is termed “peer” or “near-peer” education . These terms are often applied to structured group teaching sessions, as opposed to the more common and informal one-on-one teaching that occurs on the clinical wards. Near-peer teaching can be beneficial for both the junior and senior learners alike: the more junior learners benefit from having a teacher who is sensitive to their position and knowledge level. The more senior learners benefit by solidifying their knowledge on a topic and from the opportunity to improve their teaching skills. Indeed, some research suggests that teaching can help students become more effective learners themselves .
