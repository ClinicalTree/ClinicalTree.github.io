## Rationale and Objectives

New tests are typically assessed by estimating their technical and diagnostic performance through comparisons with a reference standard. A valid reference standard, however, is not always available and is not required for assessing the interchangeability of a new test with an existing one.

## Materials and Methods

To show interchangeability of a new test with an existing test, one compares the differences in diagnoses between the new and existing tests to differences between diagnoses made with the existing test on several occasions. We illustrate the test for interchangeability with two studies. In a transcatheter aortic valve replacement study, we test whether semiautomated analysis can be used interchangeably with manual reconstructions from three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) images. In patients with femoroacetabular impingement, we test whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can replace CT to measure acetabular version.

## Results

Although the semiautomated method agreed often with the manual measurement of aortic valve size (87.6%), interchanging the semiautomated method with manual measurements by an expert would lead to a 1.7%–12.2% increase in the frequency of disagreement. Interchanging MRI for CT to measure acetabular version would lead to differences in angle measurements of 2.0° to 3.1° in excess of the differences we would expect to see with CT alone.

## Conclusions

Testing for agreement or correlation between a new and an existing test is not sufficient evidence of the performance of a new test. A formal evaluation of interchangeability can be conducted in the absence of a reference standard.

As new medical imaging tests and procedures are developed, it is imperative that their performance be assessed before the new test can be used in clinical practice. The intended use of the new test affects how it is assessed. If the new test is to be used as an adjunct to the existing test, then its performance in combination with the existing test should be superior to the performance of the existing test alone. If the new test is to replace the existing test, then its performance as a stand alone should not be inferior to the existing test. Another role for new tests is interchangeability with an existing test. Here, we assess whether the new test can be switched with the existing test without affecting individual patients' diagnoses.

For adjunct and replacement roles, new tests are assessed by estimating their technical and diagnostic performance through comparisons with a gold or reference standard (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis) . We compare the performance (eg area under the ROC curve) of the new and existing tests for the relevant _population of patients_ . A valid reference standard, however, is not always available and is not required for assessing interchangeability. When interchanging a new test with an existing test, we must have sufficient evidence that for _individual patients_ , either of the tests can be used with similar results. Replacement is a less burdensome criterion than interchangeability because the test results of individual patients do not need to agree, only the performance over the population of patients.
