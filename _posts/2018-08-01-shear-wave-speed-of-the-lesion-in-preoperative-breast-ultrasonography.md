## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to investigate the relationship between shear wave speed (SWS) of the lesion on preoperative breast ultrasonography (US) and disease-free survival of patients with primary operable invasive breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. A total of 195 consecutive newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer patients (age 33–83 years; mean 54.0 years) with preoperative breast US with SWS measurement of the lesion were identified. They underwent surgery between May 2012 and May 2013. SWS was measured at the center and three marginal zones in the main tumors, and the maximum value was used for analyses. For 35 patients who underwent primary systemic therapy (PST), the maximum SWS before PST was used. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to identify the relationship between clinical-pathologic factors and disease-free survival.

## Results

Fourteen recurrences occurred at 6–47 months (mean 22.3 months) after surgery. On multivariate analysis, a positive history of PST (hazard ratio \[HR\] = 4.93; 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 1.66, 14.70; _P_ = .004), adjuvant chemotherapy (HR = 3.67; 95% CI: 1.11, 12.1; _P_ = .033), and higher maximum SWS (HR = 1.55; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.23; _P_ = .020) were associated with poorer disease-free survival.

## Conclusion

Higher maximum SWS on preoperative US, in addition to a positive history of PST and adjuvant chemotherapy, was significantly associated with poorer disease-free survival of patients with invasive breast cancer.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies and a leading cause of cancer mortality among women. Although a multidisciplinary approach including the development of screening and adjuvant therapy has improved the mortality rate , there are still more than 500,000 women who die from this malignancy per year worldwide . In planning therapeutic options for each breast cancer patient, it is beneficial to develop a prognosis. Studies have shown that information acquired from preoperative images including breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used as prognostic factors .

Shear wave elastography is a method of quantitatively measuring tissue elasticity during breast ultrasonography (US) examinations. Focused acoustic radiation force pushing pulses of short duration and the speed of the shear waves that are propagated in a direction orthogonal to the direction of the tissue are measured . The shear wave speed (SWS) of the lesion reflects tissue stiffness. SWS can easily be measured in clinical settings, and its use has been reported to improve accuracy in differentiating breast cancers and benign lesions when used in addition to B-mode ultrasound during breast screening and diagnosis. In addition, several studies have shown that shear wave elastography of breast cancer lesions is significantly associated with prognostic factors, including tumor size, immunohistochemical biomarkers, lymph node metastasis, and vascular and lymphovascular invasion . From these results, it is plausible that shear wave elastography could be useful for predicting outcomes, including tumor recurrence and metastasis, although these correlations have not been evaluated in previous investigations.
