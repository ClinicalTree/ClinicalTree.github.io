## Rationale and Objectives

Pilot study to determine whether among subjects receiving coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), the combination of high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) identifies a low-risk population in whom CTA might be avoided.

## Materials and Methods

A cross-sectional study of 314 symptomatic patients receiving CTA as part of their acute coronary syndrome evaluation was conducted. hsTnI was measured with Abbott Laboratories' hsTnI assay. CACSs were calculated via the Agatston method. Patients were followed for at least 30 days after discharge for the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs; all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome, and revascularization).

## Results

Of 314 subjects studied, 213 (67.8%) had no coronary artery stenosis, and 67 (21.3%), 28 (8.9%), and 6 (1.9%) had maximal coronary artery stenosis of 1%–49%, 50%–69%, and 70% or greater, respectively. All MACEs occurred during index hospitalization and include one myocardial infarction and four revascularizations. Sixty-two percent (189/307) of subjects had zero CACS, and 24% (76/314) of subjects had undetected hsTnI. No subjects with undetectable hsTnI or zero CACS had an MACE. A strategy of avoiding further testing in subjects with undetectable initial hsTnI, performing CACS on subjects with detectable initial hsTnI but nonincreased hsTnI (less than 99th percentile), and obtaining CTA in subjects with Agatston greater than 0 will have a negative predictive value of 100.0% (95% confidence interval, 98.2%–100.0%). This strategy will avoid CTA in 63% (198/314) of subjects.

## Conclusions

In this pilot study, the addition of CACS to hsTnI improves the identification of low-risk subjects in whom CTA might be avoided.

Emergency Department (ED) evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) is time consuming and costly . Many patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS, including low-risk patients, undergo extensive evaluation. Recently, coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA)-based strategies have been shown to identify suspected ACS patients who can be discharged expeditiously . However, CTA involves exposure to ionizing radiation and is costly if used indiscriminately .

A number of investigators have suggested that patients with suspected ACS who have zero coronary artery calcium score (CACS) might be a group that could be discharged home without the need for further diagnostic testing . However, in a pooled analysis of six studies a small number of patients with zero CACS had an adverse outcome. Of note, half of those with zero CACS and an adverse outcome had increased troponin measured by conventional assays .
