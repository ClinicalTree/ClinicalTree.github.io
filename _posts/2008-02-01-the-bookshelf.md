This is the 6  th edition in serial new editions dedicated to the review of radiology, produced by Lippincott Williams and Wilkins and by Wolters Kluwer Health. The well known “green book”, as previous editions have been dubbed, is divided into fourteen main sections; musculoskeletal, central nervous system, orbit, ear, nose and throat, chest, breast, heart and great vessels, liver, bile ducts, pancreas and spleen, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract, obstetrics and gynecology, nuclear medicine, statistics and water-soluble contrast media. The information discussed in the book pertains to radiological patterns, differential diagnosis and details about different diseases entities, which are listed in a bulleted outline that is both comprehensive and easy to reference. Marked with a distinct tab, each section can be quickly located.

Each section begins with a differential diagnosis for a multitude of different clinical, laboratory and radiological findings, which are listed in alphabetical order. The main finding is in bold print with the associated information clearly outlined below. Once a potential diagnosis has been established, one can refer to the second half of each section, which contains important information about each disorder, also clearly outlined. Within the section you will find additional information about function, anatomy and embryology pertaining to the specific anatomical area in question. Mnemonics can be found throughout the book as well. There are several diagrams, pictures, tables and charts scattered throughout the book, which provide helpful visual aids.

Three sections are slightly different than the rest of the book, and those are the dedicated nuclear medicine, statistics and contrast media sections. While pertinent nuclear medicine information is included throughout the book, this section goes into great detail about the nuclear medicine studies and findings for each anatomical region of the body. The statistics section is only a few pages, but provides important statistical information, formulas, tables and charts. For example, this section goes over sensitivity, specificity, ROC curves, clinical epidemiology and more. The contrast media section discusses pertinent information about the various ionic and nonionic contrast agents, in addition to contrast reactions and their treatments. One bonus feature is that on the inside front cover; there is a clear outline of important contrast reactions and treatments.

This book would be very helpful for radiology residents and practicing radiologists, who are already familiar with radiology, clinical and laboratory findings of different disease entities. It provides an excellent quick reference for every aspect of radiology. Radiology residents studying for the written or oral boards would most likely find this book helpful. For the medical student, radiology novice or clinician outside of radiology, this book would be overwhelming, and not the best guide. In my opinion, this book is intended for use as a reference book and not as a book to learn the basics of radiology, especially since no actual radiological pictures are included. Overall though, the book is outlined clearly, and finding the information in question is a quick and easy process.
