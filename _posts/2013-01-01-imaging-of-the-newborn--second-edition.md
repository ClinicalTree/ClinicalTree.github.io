This second edition of _Imaging of the Newborn_ is a quick, focused, and easily digestible read. The book is organized into 13 chapters, each covering a different topic, such as newborn anatomy, metabolic disease, catheters and tubes, neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and prenatal screening. It also devotes a chapter to the principles of the radiologic investigation of neonates and a chapter to the evidence-based use of diagnostic imaging. It provides a practical approach to neonatal imaging and targets not only radiologists but also neonatal practitioners and subspecialists.

As a pediatric radiology fellow, I found this text to be extremely useful in my day-to-day interpretation of newborn imaging. It reinforced some concepts that I had already learned and also introduced me to some new concepts that I had not considered, such as using lateral images of the neck to better evaluate endotracheal tube positioning. The chapter on misplaced catheters and tubes and the chapter on neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are especially useful and include many examples of the various ways these tubes and catheters can go astray, important topics for anyone caring for pediatric patients or interpreting their images to be familiar with.

I also enjoyed the sections of the book devoted to ways to improve neonatal imaging. Topics it touches on include suggestions about ways to qualitatively improve clinicians' use of radiology, such as having daily rounds with the neonatal intensive care unit, creating guidelines as to the appropriate use of imaging, and eliminating routine daily chest x-rays. There is also good discussion of topics such as the adoption of standards on certain imaging topics such as intracranial hemorrhage to improve reliability.

Many images are provided to illustrate the different pathologies discussed. Overall, the image quality is good. However, my only complaint is that some of the images are small, making it difficult to appreciate the relevant pathology. The figure texts also tend to be lengthy and somewhat difficult to follow.

Nevertheless, this book is an excellent read and a good supplement to my fellowship training. Any pediatric reading room would benefit from a copy.
