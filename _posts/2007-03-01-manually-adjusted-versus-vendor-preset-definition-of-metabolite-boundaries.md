## Rationale and Objectives

Metabolite peak boundary definition is an important postprocessing step in proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (  1 H-MRS). We compare metabolite ratios calculated using three different postprocessing strategies: software-rendered default peak boundaries, manually adjusted peak boundaries and a curve-fitting program. The first two of these methods are commercially available.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 42 spectra acquired on a 1.5-T MR unit using two-dimensional chemical shift proton MR spectroscopy (TR/TE = 1500/144 ms) were analyzed. Choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and _N_ -acetylaspartate (NAA) relative concentrations were derived and the following metabolite ratios were calculated: Cho/Cr, Cho/NAA, and NAA/Cr. Metabolite concentrations/ratios were calculated using (a) default peak boundaries rendered by commercially available, postprocessing software (Functool 2000, version 2.6.0); (b) manually adjusted peak boundaries by an experienced spectroscopist, using an option offered by the same commercially available software; and (c) an offline in-house curve-fitting program. Measurements obtained with method (c) were considered as the “gold standard.” Paired _t_ -tests comparing default and adjusted metabolite ratios, as well as default and adjusted ratios with their respective curve-fit values were used for statistical analysis.

## Results

Significant differences between default and manually adjusted values were found for Cho/Cr ratios <1.5 and for all Cho/NAA ratios. For Cho/Cr ratios <1.5, significant differences between default and curve-fit values were present; this was not the case when comparing manually adjusted and curve-fit values. Default and manually adjusted Cho/NAA ratios were significantly higher than corresponding curve-fit ratios. Manually adjusted values were, however, closer to the curve-fit values. No significant differences were noted between default and adjusted NAA/Cr values; default and manually adjusted ratios were significantly lower than curve-fit ratios.

## Conclusion

There can be significant differences in metabolite ratios calculated using default and manually adjusted peak limits in proton MR spectroscopy. Furthermore, Cho/Cr and NAA/Cho adjusted metabolite ratios are closer to curve-fit values, which are considered the most accurate of the three.

In vivo proton MR spectroscopy has become an important tool in the workup of focal brain lesions ( ). Spectral interpretation involves visual analysis of metabolic peaks and metabolite ratio calculations for lesion characterization. Vendor-provided spectral analysis software is commonly used in clinical practice since it offers an efficient and standardized means for data reduction. These vendor-provided software packages may invoke preset boundaries for metabolite peak area integration. In our experience with spectral postprocessing, we have often encountered a visually apparent misalignment of spectral locations using the preset vendor-provided limits relative to the “true” metabolite peaks. This misalignment can present either as a generalized trend or within a subset of voxels in a 2D CSI dataset and could lead to clinically significant alterations in metabolite ratio calculations.

One strategy to approach this apparent discrepancy between preset and “true” metabolite peak limits is to manually adjust the different peak boundaries for each dataset. A more elaborate way of addressing metabolite peak limits is by using a curve-fitting program that ameliorates quantification of partially overlapping peaks ( ). A number of these curve-fitting programs are commercially available. The purpose of our study was to assess changes in calculated metabolite ratios when using preset vendor-provided metabolite peak limits as opposed to manually adjusted peak boundaries and curve-fitting methods.
