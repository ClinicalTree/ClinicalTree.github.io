## Rationale and Objectives

The rates of enrollment of volunteers for brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies vary by demographic and clinical characteristics. We use data from a large MRI study to identify factors associated with differential enrollment and to examine potential biases this may produce in study results.

## Materials and Methods

Results from recruitment of 1,431 women into the MRI substudy of the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS-MRI) are described. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the degree of bias associated with missing data on estimates of risk factor relationships.

## Results

Of 2,345 women contacted from an established cohort of women older than 70 years of age, 72% consented to undergo screening for WHIMS-MRI. Scanning was ultimately completed on 61%. Completion rates varied according to a range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics that may be related to study outcomes. Plausible levels of selective enrollment in magnetic resonance imaging studies may produce moderate biases (< ±20%) in characterizations of risk factor relationships. Adverse events, such as claustrophobia, occurred during 1.7% of the attempted scans and, in 0.8% of instances, led to lost data.

## Conclusions

Enrollment of older women into brain imaging studies is feasible, although selection biases may limit how well study cohorts reflect more general populations.

Clinical trials and cohort studies increasingly are designed to include magnetic resonance imaging outcomes. Experiences with this new technology have provided successful protocols for standardized measurement, assessment, and safety ( ). Brain magnetic resonance studies conducted in established cohorts have reported consent rates ranging from 71% to 90% and yields of completed imaging in 57%–72% of contacted individuals. However, these rates appear to vary markedly among subgroups based on important demographic and clinical factors ( ). Thus, although it appears that recruitment into brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies is feasible, differential selection could have the potential to bias research findings.

We used data from the Women’s Health Initiative Memory Study Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study (WHIMS-MRI) to explore potential biases. We report rates of women who consented to undergo screening for the study, as a whole and by various subgroups, to identify potential barriers to recruiting participants. We also report the rates that MRI images were obtained, which are jointly affected by consent, eligibility criteria, and factors that interfere with imaging, such as claustrophobia. A sensitivity analysis was then performed to understand how selection biases inherent in enrollment may ultimately influence estimates of relationships among study outcomes. Additionally, we also describe the rate and nature of serious adverse events that were reported during the scanning procedure, some of which resulted in interruption of scanning and loss of data.
