## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the repeatability and agreement of a semiautomated liver segmentation method with manual segmentation for assessment of total liver volume on CT (computed tomography).

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective, institutional review board–approved study was conducted in 41 subjects who underwent liver CT for preoperative planning. The major pathologies encountered were colorectal cancer metastases, benign liver lesions and hepatocellular carcinoma. This semiautomated segmentation method is based on variational interpolation and 3D minimal path–surface segmentation. Total and subsegmental liver volumes were segmented from contrast-enhanced CT images in venous phase. Two image analysts independently performed semiautomated segmentations and two other image analysts performed manual segmentations. Repeatability and agreement of both methods were evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland–Altman analysis. Interaction time was recorded for both methods.

## Results

Bland–Altman analysis revealed an intrareader agreement of −1 ± 27 mL (mean ± 1.96 standard deviation) with ICC of 0.999 ( _P_ < .001) for manual segmentation and 12 ± 97 mL with ICC of 0.991 ( _P_ < .001) for semiautomated segmentation. Bland–Altman analysis revealed an interreader agreement of −4 ± 22 mL with ICC of 0.999 ( _P_ < .001) for manual segmentation and 5 ± 98 mL with ICC of 0.991 ( _P_ < .001) for semiautomated segmentation. Intermethod agreement was found to be 3 ± 120 mL with ICC of 0.988 ( _P_ < .001). Mean interaction time was 34.3 ± 16.7 minutes for the manual method and 8.0 ± 1.2 minutes for the semiautomated method ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

A semiautomated segmentation method can substantially shorten interaction time while preserving a high repeatability and agreement with manual segmentation.

Assessment of liver volume is a mandatory step before extended hepatectomy for determining the anticipated future liver remnant and before living-donor liver transplantation for selection of appropriate candidates . Liver volumetry requires a multiplanar imaging modality. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the preferred imaging modality for surgical planning because of its superior spatial resolution and short acquisition time . Use of CT in presurgical imaging allows for concomitant assessment of vascular anatomy and quality of liver parenchyma and allows determination of total and lobar volume .

The reference standard method to estimate liver volume involves manually delineating the liver outline, a process called “segmentation,” on consecutive CT images. This method is cumbersome, time-consuming, and impractical for widespread clinical use . Formula-based liver volume estimation using patient height and weight has also been proposed . However, this approach is based on a linear regression equation and is not specific to patient anatomy .

The software then uses variational interpolation to generate an initial 3D shape. This 3D shape is deformed manually then automatically by minimal path–surface segmentation.
