## Rationale and Objectives

There is little agreement within the radiology literature as to the best single measurement for assessing splenomegaly. In this study, we evaluate the correlation of multiple unidirectional measurements of the spleen with splenic volume in patients with cirrhotic liver morphology on computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

Splenic volume was retrospectively calculated from CT examinations of 179 adult patients, 47 of whom were approved as renal donors, and 132 of whom were referred for various other indications, and were found to have cirrhotic liver morphology on CT. Seven unidimensional measurements (long-axis, cranial-caudal, width, and four measures of thickness) of each spleen were evaluated to identify which most closely correlated with the calculated volume.

## Results

The splenic width had the best correlation with splenic volume for mild-to-moderate splenomegaly, and the splenic cranial-caudal measurement had the best correlation with splenic volume for massive splenomegaly. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrates that a splenic width measurement of approximately 10.5 cm has a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 78% for mild-to-moderate splenomegaly, and a cranial-caudal measurement of 14.6 cm has a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 91% for massive splenomegaly.

## Conclusions

A splenic width threshold of 10.5 cm is the most sensitive (89%) and specific (78%) single measurement for mild-to-moderate splenomegaly in patients with cirrhotic liver morphology, whereas a cranial-caudal height threshold of 14.6 cm is the most sensitive (92%) and specific (91%) single measurement for massive splenomegaly.

## Introduction

Although nonspecific, splenomegaly is an important finding in a variety of disease processes, including portal hypertension, hematologic disorders, and chronic inflammatory conditions . In patients who have cirrhosis or who are at risk of cirrhosis, identification of splenomegaly is of particular value, as splenomegaly is the most sensitive imaging finding of portal hypertension, and correlation between splenomegaly and the subsequent development of cirrhosis, as well as between splenomegaly and the severity of esophageal varices, has been established . However, determining splenomegaly on computed tomography (CT) imaging has long vexed the radiology community, and there is no established consensus for when or how to diagnose it. The gold standard for determining splenomegaly requires calculating the splenic volume, although this is rarely performed, as it is both technically challenging and time-consuming . Rather, radiologists commonly rely on unidimensional proxy measurements, including cranial-caudal (CC) and long-axis (LA) measurements, as seen in  Figure 1 . Despite the common use of these measurements, no single unidimensional measurement has been established in the literature with both a high sensitivity and a high specificity for all cases of splenomegaly, owing largely to the complex and varied shape and orientation of the spleen. For example, the commonly accepted LA and CC measurements of the spleen, ranging from 10 to 13 cm, have been demonstrated to have a low sensitivity (33%–68%) and specificity (68%–76%) for sub-massive splenomegaly, resulting in both underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis .
