## Rationale and Objectives

In this proof-of-concept demonstration, we aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively compare pulmonary ventilation abnormalities derived from Fourier decomposition of free-breathing  1 H magnetic resonance imaging (FDMRI) to hyperpolarized  3 He MRI in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis.

## Materials and Methods

All subjects provided written informed consent to a protocol approved by a local research ethics board and Health, Canada, and they underwent MRI, computed tomography (CT), spirometry, and plethysmography during a single 2-hour visit. Semiautomated segmentation was used to generate ventilation defect measurements derived from FDMRI and  3 He MRI, and these were compared using analysis of variance and Pearson correlations.

## Results

Twenty-six subjects were evaluated including 12 COPD subjects (67 ± 9 years) and 14 bronchiectasis subjects (70 ± 11 years). For COPD subjects, FDMRI and  3 He MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP) was 7 ± 6% and 24 ± 14%, respectively ( _P_ < .001; bias = −16 ± 9%). In COPD subjects, FDMRI was significantly correlated with  3 He MRI VDP (r = .88; _P_ = .0001),  3 He MRI apparent diffusion coefficient (r = .71; _P_ < .05), airways resistance (r = .60; _P_ < .05), and RA  950 (r = .80; _P_ < .01). In subjects with bronchiectasis, FDMRI VDP (5 ± 3%) and  3 He MRI VDP (18 ± 9%) were significantly different ( _P_ < .001) and not correlated ( _P_ > .05). The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) for FDMRI and  3 He MRI ventilation was 86 ± 7% for COPD and 86 ± 4% for bronchiectasis subjects ( _P_ > .05); the DSC for FDMRI ventilation defects and CT RA  950 was 19 ± 20% in COPD and 2 ± 3% in bronchiectasis subjects ( _P_ < .01).

## Conclusions

FDMRI and  3 He MRI VDP were strongly related in COPD but not in bronchiectasis subjects. In COPD only, FDMRI ventilation defects were spatially related with  3 He ventilation defects and emphysema.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is diagnosed and disease severity stratified based on irreversible airflow obstruction measured using spirometry. Airflow obstruction, symptoms, and exercise capacity measurements in COPD are related to both parenchyma destruction (emphysema) and airway remodeling (airways disease and bronchiectasis) . Although spirometry is relatively easy to implement, reproducible, and inexpensive, it can only provide a global measure of lung function and is weakly predictive of COPD progression, as well as insensitive to early disease stages . The limitations of spirometry measurements of COPD have motivated the development of thoracic imaging approaches to provide direct and regional measurements of the underlying pathologic features of COPD—airways disease and emphysema.

High-resolution computed tomography is the clinical imaging tool of choice for visualizing and quantifying airways disease and emphysema in patients with COPD. Emphysema can be quantified automatically based on thresholds of the CT density histogram (<−950 Hounsfield units \[HU\]) . Thoracic CT estimates of airways disease can also be generated using measurements of airway wall area percent (WA%) and lumen area (LA). Indirect measurements of airways disease include CT measurements of gas trapping using densitometry thresholds (−856 HU) on expiratory CT images or parametric response maps using coregistered inspiratory and expiratory CT . Finally, bronchiectasis can be readily observed in thoracic CT in up to 50% of patients with severe COPD , and this is typically identified by enlarged bronchial diameters and evidence of significant mucous plugging.
