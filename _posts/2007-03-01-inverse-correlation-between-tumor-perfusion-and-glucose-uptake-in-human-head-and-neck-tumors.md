## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to determine the relationship between tumor blood flow and glucose uptake in head and neck tumors using perfusion computed tomography (PCT) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval and informed consent were obtained for this study. Sixteen patients (mean age, 67 years; age range, 36–89 years) who had known or suspected head and neck tumors (15 malignant tumors and one schwannoma) underwent PCT and FDG PET examinations. Tumor area was measured on conventional CT images. The PCT data were postprocessed using maximum slope method analysis, and standardized uptake value (SUV) was measured on FDG PET.

## Results

Mean arterial perfusion of the tumors was 61.56 mL/min/100 mL (range 22.17–102.7 mL/min/100 mL), and mean FDG SUV was 7.48 (range 2.74–17.1). A significant negative correlation between arterial perfusion and FDG SUV was found for malignant tumors ( _r_ = −0.538, _P_ = .04, n = 15).

## Conclusion

There was an inverse relationship between arterial perfusion and glucose uptake of head and neck malignant tumors, suggesting that the malignant tumors may depend on anaerobic glycolysis.

Computed tomography (CT) is widely used as a noninvasive method to evaluate head and neck tumors. CT is based on anatomic information. Besides an anatomical analysis, a functional analysis of CT is also possible with use of perfusion CT (PCT) technique. Contrast-enhanced dynamic CT provides quantitative information about blood flow noninvasively. In general, the active portion of malignant tumors exhibit increases perfusion because of their neovascularization. PCT has been used to measure in vivo blood flow in various types of tumors ( ).

Positron emission tomography (PET) is also a functional imaging method. There are various PET tracers including, but not limited to, fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; 8, 9), to measure glucose uptake; fluorine-18-fluoroerythronitroimidazole (FETNIM; 10, 11) and fluorine-18-fluoromisonimidazole (FMISO; 12, 13), to measure tissue oxygenation; and \[  15 O\]H  2 O ( ) to measure blood flow. Malignant tissues are hypermetabolic compared to normal tissue, and the metabolic rate of glucose is not an exception. FDG, an analog of glucose that is metabolized in viable cells by the same pathways as glucose, is known to have a higher uptake in various malignant tumors compared to normal tissue ( ).
