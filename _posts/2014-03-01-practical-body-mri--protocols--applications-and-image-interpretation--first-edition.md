_Practical Body MRI: Protocols, Applications and Image Interpretation_ is a concise introduction to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis that delivers the quintessential information for protocoling body MR examinations, assuring the technical adequacy of the studies, and developing a pattern of search for the most common examinations. The focus of the text is not exhaustive differential diagnoses or prolonged esoteric digressions. In fact, this book originated as a handout for residents on their first body MRI rotation. As author David Grand explains, “this book is for the inexperienced… It is simply written, but it is not simplified.” Indeed, _Practical Body MRI_ serves as an excellent starting point for beginners looking to understand, perform, and interpret MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.

The book is divided into four sections. The first provides a very general overview of how MR images are obtained, what information is available in each of the commonly used pulse sequences, and an introduction to intravenous and oral MR contrast agents. The remainder of the book explores common MR examinations throughout the body, including the usual indications for the examination, a typical imaging protocol, a brief discussion of what the reader should look for on each of the sequences within the protocol, and how to synthesize this information into a unifying diagnosis; each chapter concludes with a concise summary and “pearls and pitfalls” section. Section two discusses MR examinations of the abdomen (including the liver, pancreaticobiliary tree, kidneys, adrenal glands, and intestines). Section three discusses MR examinations of the pelvis (including the uterus, adnexa, female urethra, pelvic floor, prostate, rectum, and gravid uterus/placenta). Section four discusses MR angiography (including the MR arteriography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as MR venography).

Throughout the book, several carefully selected and high-quality black-and-white figures are included to illustrate and clarify the prose. High-yield information is summarized and tabulated for quick reference.

The chapters on imaging the pregnant patient, pelvic floor, and pancreas are particularly well done, as are the chapters on prostate and rectal MRI. Of note, the section on MR angiography is extremely brief (even by the standards of this already-slim text). For instance, the discussion of interpreting female pelvic angiography is only one paragraph long; future editions would benefit from fleshing out these chapters a little more.

In conclusion, _Practical Body MRI: Protocols, Applications and Image Interpretation_ serves its purpose of providing a concise and high-yield introduction to planning, performing, and interpreting MR examinations of the abdomen and pelvis. Its plainspoken delivery and manageable length make it an ideal resource for residents, fellows, and practicing radiologists who are new to body MRI. A Kindle version is available, but the hardcover edition is “backpack-friendly” and should be well within most trainee book fund budgets. _Practical Body MRI_ is highly recommended as a workstation resource or as an addition to personal or department libraries.
