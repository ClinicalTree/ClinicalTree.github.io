## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine whether key radiology report “consumers” in our institution prefer structured measurement reporting in a dedicated report section over the current practice of embedding measurements throughout the “Findings” section, given the availability of new tools for quantitative imaging interpretation that enable automated structured reporting of measurement data.

## Materials and Methods

Oncologic clinicians and radiologists at our institution were surveyed regarding their preferences for a standard report versus three reports each having uniquely formatted dedicated “Measurements” sections and regarding their impressions of various characteristics of report quality demonstrated by these reports. The online survey was completed by 25 radiologists, 16 oncologists, and 17 oncology nurses and research assistants (registrars).

## Results

Aggregation of respondents' preferences by group into single orderings using the Kemeny–Young method revealed that both oncology groups preferred all proposed reports to the standard report but that radiologists only preferred two of the proposed reports to the standard report. All preferences for proposed reports in the two oncology groups were statistically significant based on Wilcoxon tests, but the preference for only one of the proposed reports was significant for radiologists. Additional results suggest that these preferences are driven by respondent favor for the readability of and confidence conveyed by the proposed reports compared to the standard report.

## Conclusions

Oncologic clinicians responding to our survey preferred communication of lesion measurements in a separate report section to the current practice of embedding measurements throughout the “Findings” section, based on their assessments of reports containing simulated measurement sections assembled from a single sample report using standardized formatting.

Imaging-derived tumor measurements serve as critical quantitative biomarkers that are used to apply disease response criteria in routine oncologic care and in pharmaceutical trials and are as—if not more—crucial in guiding patient care in these settings as the qualitative interpretative information that radiologists generally focus on providing when creating reports. Given these clinical expectations, historical reluctance by radiologists to measure tumors and other imaging findings in addition to qualitatively describing and interpreting these findings has given way to the now routine practice of providing quantitative data during imaging interpretation, at least in major US cancer centers . Not coincidentally, many oncologists in the same centers have come to expect that tumor measurements be made routinely for all patients with cancer regardless of whether a given patient is enrolled in a pharmaceutical trial .

Mirroring these reported trends, radiologists at our institution routinely report measured lesions—regardless of a patient's trial status—in the narrative “Findings” section of the report in prose that combines a qualitative assessment of the lesion with a quantitative assessment, the latter of which consists of the lesion's size in all relevant dimensions on the current examination, its image and series coordinates, and its size in all relevant dimensions on the prior examination, for example, “left submandibular lymph node has enlarged, measuring 14 × 9 mm on series 7, image 33 (7 × 4 mm on prior study dated January 1, 2001).” In this sentence, it is the qualitative assessment (“has enlarged”) that represents the primary value contributed by the radiologist to the report; all other information is merely translated by the radiologist from the picture archiving and communication system (PACS) display into the report through dictation–transcription and/or typing. Unfortunately, this translated and noninterpreted information constitutes a substantial source of both errors and inefficiency in the reporting process, as these steps are executed by human agents . The demand for quantitative imaging data by ordering physicians as previously discussed only compounds the problems of introduced error and reduced interpretation efficiency associated with its generation. Furthermore, such text-based measurement reporting limits automated measurement summation or computation of disease response metrics and requires the ordering physician to tabulate this data and make any necessary calculations manually , further adding to the inefficiency inherent to current quantitative imaging workflow.
