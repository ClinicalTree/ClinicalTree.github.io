Reviews of published scientific literature are a valuable resource that can underline best practices in medicine and clarify clinical controversies. Among the various types of reviews, the systematic review of the literature is ranked as the most rigorous since it is a high-level summary of existing evidence focused on answering a precise question. Systematic reviews employ a pre-defined protocol to identify relevant and trustworthy literature. Such reviews can accomplish several critical goals that are not easily achievable with typical empirical studies by allowing identification and discussion of best evidence, contradictory findings, and gaps in the literature. The Association of University Radiologists Radiology Research Alliance Systematic Review Task Force convened to explore the methodology and practical considerations involved in performing a systematic review. This article provides a detailed and practical guide for performing a systematic review and discusses its applications in radiology.

## Introduction

Review of the existing scientific literature is a valuable resource for generating best practices in medicine and clarifying clinical controversies with greater study power than an individual study. Several terms are commonly used to describe these types of _post hoc_ review articles, including systematic review, literature review, overview, scoping review, meta-analysis, practice guidelines, and many others. Although there are some similarities between these types of reviews, there are substantial differences in the scope, goals, and methodology of each. For example, “literature review” is a generic term commonly used for reviews that qualitatively discuss a topic, often in an informal and unstructured manner that is subject to author bias . In contrast, “meta-analysis” is a method of statistically combining findings from multiple quantitative studies to increase statistical power and validity .

A “systematic review” is a high-level summary of existing evidence focused on answering a precise question . To be considered truly “systematic,” a review must ask a specific research question and apply an explicit and thorough methodology to comprehensively review all the available information . The use of a pre-defined protocol to identify relevant and trustworthy literature makes the systematic review a research study in itself. This methodology reduces author bias and allows identification and discussion of best evidence, contradictory findings, and gaps in the literature. Systematic reviews commonly underpin clinical practice guidelines, which aim to incorporate this scientific evidence with non-empirical information, such as risks and costs. These reviews may also result in the proposal of new theories and development of future research directions . For these reasons, systematic reviews are often placed highly on the hierarchy of evidence. If sufficient high-quality data are obtained during a systematic review, they may be pooled using a meta-analysis.

In this article, we will explore the methodology and practical considerations involved in performing a systematic review. Following a brief overview of systematic reviews, the first section will address the preparatory steps involved in creating a systematic review. The second section will describe how to conduct the literature search using a pre-defined search protocol. The third section will address the data analysis and quality assurance steps that take place after the literature search. The article will then conclude with a discussion of the role of systematic reviews in radiology. For convenience, a glossary of commonly used methodology terms related to systematic reviews has been included in  Appendix 1 .

## OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

The most widely used methodology guidelines for systematic reviews are published by the Cochrane Collaboration. The Cochrane Collaboration is an independent non-profit organization with over 37,000 contributors from more than 130 countries that organizes medical research findings by developing systematic reviews of healthcare interventions and diagnostic tests. These “Cochrane Reviews” are published in the Cochrane Library and periodically updated with the latest research findings. The Cochrane Collaboration also publishes the Cochrane Handbook , which serves not only as a guide for authors writing a Cochrane Review but also as a widely accepted guide for writing any systematic review. The Cochrane Collaboration divides the general methods for conducting systematic reviews into the following steps: define the question, develop inclusion criteria, search for studies, select studies and collect data, assess risk of bias in included studies, analyze data, and report results . Combining this framework with a similar framework from Gough, et al , we outline the steps to performing a systematic review as follows (see  Figure 1 ).

Using the PICOS model, the research question commonly takes the form of, “What is the effect of (intervention/exposure) on (population) relative to (control) as measured by (outcomes), according to the data reported in all (study design) studies?”

> (“multiple sclerosis” OR “Multiple Sclerosis” OR “MS” OR “Demyelinating disease” OR “demyelination” OR “demyelinating disorder” OR “optic neuritis with demyelination”)

However, such search strings are often not adequate for diagnostic test accuracy studies, since the methods may not be reported in the title or abstract and indexing terms may not be assigned, which will result in the missing of relevant studies and addition of irrelevant studies. One study found that none of the methodological filters have the combined sensitivity and precision for identifying primary diagnostic accuracy studies . Hence, it is recommended to use more than just the index condition, diagnostic test, and methodological filter when searching for studies related to diagnostic test accuracy .

DOMAIN PATIENT SELECTION INDEX TEST REFERENCE STANDARD FLOW AND TIMING Description • Describe patient-selection methods

• Describe included patients (presentation, previous testing, intended use of index test, setting) Describe the index test, its execution and interpretation Describe the reference standard, its execution and interpretation • Describe patients who did not receive the index test and/or reference standard or those who were excluded from 2 × 2 table

• Describe the time interval and any interventions between index test(s) and reference standard Signaling questions (yes/no/unclear) • Was the patient selection consecutive or random?

• Was case-control design avoided?

• Were inappropriate exclusions avoided?  \\*  • Were the index tests interpreted without knowledge of results of the reference standard?

• Was the threshold pre-specified (if used)? • Is the reference standard likely to correctly classify the target condition?

• Were the reference standard results interpreted without knowledge of index test results? • Was there an appropriate interval between index test(s) and reference standard?

• Did all patients get the reference standard?

• Did all patients get the same reference standard?

• Were all patients included in the analysis? Risk of bias: (High/low/unclear) Could patient-selection have introduced bias? Could the execution or interpretation of the index test have introduced bias? Could the execution or interpretation of the reference test have introduced bias? Could the patient flow have introduced bias? Concerns about applicability

(High/low/unclear) Are there concerns that the included patients do not match the review question? Are there concerns that the index test, its execution, or interpretation differ from the review question? Are there concerns that the target condition as defined by the reference standard does not match the review question?
