## Rationale and Objectives

There has been a trend toward lowering tube potential in computed tomography angiography (CTA) examinations to reduce radiation dose or contrast medium dose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of tube potential on peripheral artery in-stent lumen visibility in CTA examinations.

## Materials and Methods

Nine different peripheral artery stents were placed in a vessel phantom (inner diameter: 5 mm, surrounded by water) and scanned consecutively using a 128-row CT scanner with 70, 80, 100, 120, and 140 kV and two different concentrations of contrast medium to simulate contrast-enhanced blood. Medium-smooth and ultra-sharp reconstruction kernels with filtered back projection (B30f, B46f) and iterative reconstruction technique (I30f, I46f) were used. Visible in-stent lumen diameter and artifact width were evaluated using a semiautomatic software tool. All stents were scanned with digital angiography, which was regarded as the reference standard.

## Results

Averaged over all stents, visible in-stent lumen diameter ranged from 1.30 ± 0.21 mm (CM2/70 kV/I30f) to 3.13 ± 0.32 mm (CM1/120 kV/I46f). In-stent lumen diameters were significantly higher for 120 and 140 kV compared to 70 kV (2.39 ± 0.73 and 2.39 ± 0.66 mm vs 1.99 ± 0.69 mm; _P_ = 0.01 and _P_ = 0.005). Ultra-sharp reconstruction kernels lead to significantly better in-stent lumen visibility than smooth reconstruction kernels (B46f: 2.74 ± 0.34 mm vs B30f: 1.57 ± 0.36 mm; _P_ < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, in-stent lumen visibility was improved for iterative reconstructions compared to filtered back projection (I46f: 2.93 ± 0.30 mm vs B46f: 2.74 ± 0.34 mm; _P_ < 0.001). Contrast medium concentration did not influence in-stent lumen visibility.

## Conclusions

Despite all known benefits of low kV CTA protocols, the use of a very low tube potential may hamper in-stent lumen visibility. A sharp kernel may be of value when evaluating the inner lumen of vascular stents.

## Introduction

Stent-assisted angioplasty is commonly performed in peripheral and visceral artery stenosis or occlusions . Restenosis after stent implementation may occur because of intimal hyperplasia . Furthermore, stent thrombosis may occur. Therefore, evaluation of in-stent lumen can be of significant importance in patients following stent implementation. In clinical routine, three noninvasive methods may be used to evaluate the vascular status of the peripheral arteries: duplex ultrasound, magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomography angiography (CTA).

Duplex ultrasound is widely available and leads to a good vascular assessment but suffers from a relevant interobserver variability . Furthermore, not all anatomic regions can be assessed using duplex ultrasound. Magnetic resonance angiography allows excellent peripheral vascular assessment, but in the presence of metallic stents magnetic field inhomogeneities might cause pseudo-stenoses or pseudo-obstructions . Multidetector single-energy CTA is routinely performed for assessment of peripheral and visceral arteries, and provides high sensitivity and specificity for assessment of vascular stenoses .

A spline function was fitted onto the pixels ( green line ). Apparent stent width was measured using the full width at half maximum approach ( red and green asterisks ). Transition between the visible lumen and stent artifact was defined as the first pixel exceeding the sum of the mean HU within the lumen ( black asterisks ) plus two times the image noise ( dotted black line ). The resulting visible lumen diameter is represented as a blue line on the CT image (left).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/StentLumenVisibilityinSingleenergyCTAngiography/0_1s20S1076633216300137.jpg)
