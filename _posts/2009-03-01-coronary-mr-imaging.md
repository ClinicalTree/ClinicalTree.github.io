## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate whether a respiratory biofeedback system could increase navigator efficiency and maintain image quality compared to conventional respiratory-gated magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA).

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen healthy volunteers underwent MRCA using three different respiratory-gating protocols. A conventional expiratory free-breathing (FB) sequence was compared to two approaches using navigator echo biofeedback (NEB), a midinspiratory approach (NEBin) and an expiratory approach (NEBex). Navigator data reflecting the position of the diaphragm relative to a 3-mm gating window were made available to the subject using a video projector in combination with a Plexiglas screen and mirror goggles. Image quality was graded by two radiologists in consensus using a visual score ranging from 1 (not visible) to 4 (excellent vessel depiction).

## Results

The NEB approaches improved navigator efficiency (71.1% with NEBex and 68.0% with NEBin vs 42.2% with FB), thus reducing total imaging time. This difference was statistically significant ( _P_ NEBin = .007; _P_ NEBex = .001). Image quality in the NEBex group was comparable to that in the FB group (median score, 2.44 vs 2.52), but it proved to be significantly lower (median score, 1.94 vs 2.52) for the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery in the NEBin group.

## Conclusion

NEB maintains image quality and significantly increases navigator efficiency, thereby decreasing total imaging time by about 40% compared to a conventional FB acquisition strategy.

The noninvasive nature of magnetic resonance coronary angiography (MRCA) offers great potential for assessing the morphologic changes in coronary artery disease (CAD) . The benefits of excluding CAD must be balanced against the risks and adverse effects of highly invasive procedures such as conventional catheter angiography, especially in patients with low pretest probability of disease.

The two main challenges that limit the introduction of MRCA into clinical routine are cardiac and respiratory motion that give rise to severe artifacts and blurring . Various strategies have been used to compensate for motion artifacts, including cardiac gating , respiratory gating , and navigator echoes with or without section correction. To reduce or eliminate respiratory motion artifacts, two distinct approaches are used in modern MRCA: using a navigator echo to measure the superior-inferior position of the diaphragm and accepting data acquired only in a certain range while the subject breathes freely . This is usually done at the most likely position of the diaphragm (ie, end-expiration).
