## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) images the propagation of mechanical shear waves in tissue and uses that information to generate quantitative measures of tissue stiffness. Hepatic MRE has been successfully performed in thousands of patients, with good correlation between histologic grade of fibrosis and tissue stiffness. There has been no prior investigation of the utility of MRE for the assessment of kidney transplants. The aims of this study were to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of MRE in a small group of kidney transplant recipients and to correlate the measured magnetic resonance elastographic stiffness values with biopsy-proven histopathologic fibrosis.

## Materials and Methods

MRE of renal transplants was performed in 11 patients returning for protocol allograft biopsies. Calculated tissue stiffness values were compared to histologic degree of fibrosis in nine of the 11 patients.

## Results

The mean stiffness of two patients with moderate interstitial fibrosis was higher than the mean of six patients with mild interstitial fibrosis, but not significantly so (90 Hz, _P_ = .12; 120 Hz, _P_ = .17; 150 Hz, _P_ = .26). The mean stiffness of the two patients with moderate interstitial fibrosis was slightly greater than the mean of one patient with no significant interstitial fibrosis at 90 Hz ( _P_ = .78) and slightly less at 120 and 150 Hz ( _P_ = .88 and _P_ = .76). The mean stiffness of the six patients with mild interstitial fibrosis did not differ significantly from that of the one patient with no interstitial fibrosis (90 Hz, _P_ = .35; 120 Hz, _P_ = .22; 150 Hz, _P_ = .16).

## Conclusions

Preliminary results demonstrate feasibility and support known multifactorial influences on renal stiffness.

The incidence of renal allograft rejection has been considerably reduced by the introduction of immunosuppressive drugs. However, it remains difficult to optimize antirejection therapy for transplant recipients, because of the lack of noninvasive biomarkers for rejection. Kidney transplant (KTx) biopsy with histopathologic examination is therefore frequently necessary to guide therapy in patients with diminishing renal function. Ultrasound-guided KTx biopsies for interval histopathologic assessment are obtained 4 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years after transplantation at our institution. Because of strict criteria for tissue adequacy outlined in the Banff 97 classification , an international schema developed in the early 1990s for classifying renal allograft pathology, three 18-gauge core biopsy specimens are typically acquired, but the number of specimens can range from one (usually in the setting of an immediate complication) to five. As would be expected, the value of this histopathologic gold standard is heavily dependent on the biopsy specimen. Investigations of specimen inadequacy have been highly variable, with one study of 1171 biopsies reporting 23% inadequate biopsies using a 16-gauge device and 47% inadequate biopsies using an 18-gauge device , another study of 345 biopsies reporting 5.2% nondiagnostic biopsies using a 14-gauge biopsy device , and yet another study of 294 biopsies reporting only 5% inadequate biopsies using an 18-gauge device and a cortical tangential approach . The rate of major complications requiring additional intervention beyond observation, such as blood transfusion, surgery, or embolization for large perirenal hematomas, arteriovenous fistulas, or urinomas, also varies greatly, ranging from <1% to <3% . Loss of the allograft and death have also been described.

Magnetic resonance (MR) elastography (MRE) is a noninvasive, phase contrast–based technique that images the propagation of mechanical shear waves in tissue and uses that information to generate quantitative measures of tissue stiffness in kilopascals. Hepatic MRE has been successfully performed in thousands of patients, including liver transplant recipients, in whom good correlation between histologic grade of fibrosis and tissue stiffness measured with MRE has been established . Recent investigations now suggest that changes in the viscoelastic properties of tissue may reflect derangements in the extracellular matrix, which can be a harbinger of developing pathology .

The most common etiology for renal failure requiring transplantation was proliferative glomerulonephritis (four of 10 patients). One patient (patient 4) had received multiple transplants; the others still had their initial transplants. One patient presented for the first annual protocol biopsy, four patients for the 2-year protocol biopsy, one patient for a 4-year posttransplant biopsy, and four patients for the 5-year protocol biopsy.

The individual data points are superimposed over the box plots. The mean tissue stiffness was greater with moderate (Mod) fibrosis than with mild fibrosis. There was some overlap in the range of stiffness values between moderate and mild fibrosis at 120 Hz.
