## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this ex vivo study was to investigate artifacts in a cone-beam breast computed tomography (CBBCT) caused by breast tissue markers.

## Materials and Methods

Breast phantoms with self-made tissue pork mincemeat were created. Twenty-nine different, commercially available markers with varying marker size, composition, and shape were evaluated. A dedicated CBBCT evaluation of all phantoms was performed with 49 kVp, 50 and 100 mA, and marker orientation parallel and orthogonal to the scan direction. The resultant images were evaluated in sagittal, axial, and coronal view with a slice thickness of 0.5 mm. Additionally, measurements of all markers in the same directions were done with full-field digital mammography.

## Results

All markers were visible in full-field digital mammography without any artifacts. However, all markers caused artifacts on a CBBCT. Artifacts were measured as the length of the resulting streakings. Median length of artifacts was 7.2 mm with a wide range from 0 to 48.3 mm (interquartile range 4.3–11.4 mm) dependent on composition, size, shape, weight, and orientation of the markers. The largest artifacts occurred in axial view with a median size of 12.6 mm, with a range from 0 to 48.3 mm, resulting in a relative artifact length (quotient artifact in mm/real physical length of the marker itself) of 4.1 (interquartile range 2.3–6.1, range 0–8.7).

## Conclusions

Artifacts caused by markers can significantly influence image quality in a CBBCT, thus limiting primary diagnostics and follow-up in breast cancer. The size of the artifacts depends on the marker characteristics, orientation, and the image plane of reconstruction.

## Introduction

The dedicated cone-beam breast computed tomography (CBBCT) designed by Koning Corporation (West Henrietta, NY) is the first commercially available breast CT scanner. First studies reported that CBBCT can significantly improve the detection of breast masses and microcalcifications . This is owing to its high spatial and contrast resolution, and the potential of reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) information from a series of two-dimensional images .

The CBBCT system is a new and promising diagnostic technique for breast imaging and CT-guided interventions. The CT-guided system is an add-on device for the diagnostic CBBCT. All lesions requiring an image-guided biopsy not visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography can be biopsied under CT guidance instead of stereotactic biopsy.
