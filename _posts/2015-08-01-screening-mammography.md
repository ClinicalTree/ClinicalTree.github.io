## Rationale and Objectives

After a half century of clinical trials, expansive observations, vigorous advocacy and debate, screening mammography could not be in a more controversial condition, especially the potential harm of overdiagnosis. Despite a simple rationale (catch the cancer early and either prevent death or at least decrease the amount of therapy needed for cure), the estimates to date of overdiagnosis rates are conflicting and the interpretations complex.

## Materials and Methods

Since the author's 2012 publication in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the peer-reviewed publications on overdiagnosis caused by screening mammography are reviewed and the NEJM analyses updated with three additional calendar years of results.

## Results

The recent peer-reviewed medical literature on screening mammography induced overdiagnosis of breast cancer has increased exponentially, nearly 10-fold in 10 years. The average estimate of overdiagnosis is about 30%, but the range extends from 0% to 70+%. An update of the NEJM report estimates that in the US, 78,000 women and 30%–31% of those diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years or older during 2011 were overdiagnosed.

## Conclusions

Until we have better screening procedures that identify who really has cancer and needs to be treated, the risk of overdiagnosis relative to the benefit of screening merits more effective public and professional education. Radiologists, pathologists, and other professionals involved with screening mammography should recognize that the potential harm of overdiagnosis is downplayed or not discussed with the patient and family, despite agreement that the objective is informed choice.

The author of this report was privileged to study the magnitude of overdiagnosis of breast cancer in the United States (US) with H. Gilbert Welch that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) on Thanksgiving Day, 2012 and that evoked yet more controversy on the topic. Since then and as of August 1, 2014, there have been, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine (PubMed), 46 publications on overdiagnosis in breast cancer in peer-reviewed journals in English with abstracts. Since the first report that alluded to overdiagnosis in 1982, the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals has increased exponentially, from an average of 3.8 during the 5 years before 2004 to 47 in 2013 and 45 in 2014 (  Fig 1 ).

## Conclusions

[Get Radiology Tree app to read full this article<](https://clinicalpub.com/app)

> _The rationale for breast cancer screening with mammography is deceptively simple: catch it early and reduce mortality from the disease and the need for mastectomies. But breast cancer is a complex problem, and complex problems rarely have simple solutions. … A mortality reduction can never justify a medical intervention in its own right, but must be weighed against the harms. Overdiagnosis is the most important harm of breast screening … \[that\] leads to the detection and treatment of breast cancers that would otherwise never have been detected because they grow very slowly or not at all and would not have been detected in the woman's lifetime in the absence of screening. Screening therefore turns women into cancer patients unnecessarily, with life-long physical and psychological harms. The debate about the justification of breast screening is therefore not a simple question of whether screening reduces breast cancer mortality. … An effect on breast cancer mortality is doubtful in today's setting, and overdiagnosis causes an increase in the use of mastectomies. … The information provided to women in invitations and on the Internet exaggerates benefits, participation is directly recommended, and the harms are downplayed or left out, despite agreement that the objective is informed choice. This raises an ethical discussion concerning autonomy versus paternalism, and the difficulty in weighing benefits against harms. …_
