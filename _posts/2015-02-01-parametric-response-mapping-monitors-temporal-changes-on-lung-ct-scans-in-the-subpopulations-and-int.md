## Rationale and Objectives

The longitudinal relationship between regional air trapping and emphysema remains unexplored. We have sought to demonstrate the utility of parametric response mapping (PRM), a computed tomography (CT)–based biomarker, for monitoring regional disease progression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, linking expiratory- and inspiratory-based CT metrics over time.

## Materials and Methods

Inspiratory and expiratory lung CT scans were acquired from 89 COPD subjects with varying Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) status at 30 days ( _n_ = 13) or 1 year ( _n_ = 76) from baseline as part of the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in COPD Study (SPIROMICS) clinical trial. PRMs of CT data were used to quantify the relative volumes of normal parenchyma (PRM  Normal ), emphysema (PRM  Emph ), and functional small airways disease (PRM  fSAD ). PRM measurement variability was assessed using the 30-day interval data. Changes in PRM metrics over a 1-year period were correlated to pulmonary function (forced expiratory volume at 1 second \[FEV1\]). A theoretical model that simulates PRM changes from COPD was compared to experimental findings.

## Results

PRM metrics varied by ∼6.5% of total lung volume for PRM  Normal and PRM  fSAD and 1% for PRM  Emph when testing 30-day repeatability. Over a 1-year interval, only PRM  Emph in severe COPD subjects produced significant change (19%–21%). However, 11 of 76 subjects showed changes in PRM  fSAD greater than variations observed from analysis of 30-day data. Mathematical model simulations agreed with experimental PRM results, suggesting fSAD is a transitional phase from normal parenchyma to emphysema.

## Conclusions

PRM of lung CT scans in COPD patients provides an opportunity to more precisely characterize underlying disease phenotypes, with the potential to monitor disease status and therapy response.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex syndrome with multiple underlying phenotypes. As the third leading cause of mortality in the United States, research in COPD has intensified with the focus toward accurately phenotyping this complex disease . Physiologic assessment and patient-reported parameters such as dyspnea and health status continue to be the standard of care for diagnosis but have limited prognostic value as only global assessment of COPD is obtained . Although there have been considerable strides in understanding the underlying biology, limited progress has been made in improving our ability to routinely define and longitudinally monitor the varying components of COPD. As such, there is a need to develop and evaluate patient-specific biomarker surrogates of clinical status and outcome in COPD patients.

A biomarker must be technically measureable, unattainable by other methods, and useful for the effective management of patients . For COPD patients, the most widely used measure that fits this definition continues to be forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). Improvements have been made through the inclusion of FEV1 in multidimensional assessments (eg, body mass index, obstruction, dyspnea, exercise \[BODE\]) , which have improved prognostication over FEV1 alone. Nevertheless, these measures have limited capability in identifying the underlying biological components that make up the varying COPD phenotypes. Although biological components of COPD are subject to molecular and genetic heterogeneity , they do provide unique imageable characteristics including regional distribution of emphysema , air trapping , airway remodeling , regional alterations in texture , lung mechanics , and more recently measures of perfusion heterogeneity and altered pulmonary vascular dimensions .
