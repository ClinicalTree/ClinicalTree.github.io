## Rationale and Objectives

The diagnostic mammography suite is a microcosm of challenging physician–patient communication in radiology. Little has been written about communication practices in the diagnostic mammography suite, the effect of this communication on both physicians and patients, and implications for radiology training programs. We surveyed radiology residents and staff about communication training, practices, and experiences communicating directly with patients in the diagnostic mammography suite.

## Materials and Methods

We asked the membership of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology to disseminate surveys to radiology residents and staff radiologists in their institutions. We analyzed response frequencies and correlations.

## Results

We received responses from 142 residents and 120 staff radiologists. More than half of staff respondents spoke personally with every patient who had an abnormal diagnostic mammogram; 37% felt they had inadequate time to do so. Most residents and staff highly rated their own communication skills and confidence in ability to explain results and respond to patients’ emotions, but experienced stress doing so. A majority of respondents reported no formal communication skills education after medical school. Twenty-nine percent of staff respondents regularly observed residents’ communication with patients and 39% of residents reported receiving feedback about their communication. Residents’ opportunities to observe staff communicate with a patient and to receive feedback on their own patient interactions were correlated with self-rated communication skill and confidence in ability to respond to patients’ emotions ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Radiologists engage in challenging and stressful patient communication interactions. There is a paucity of educational curricula on interpersonal and communication skills in radiology. This has implications for both patient and physician satisfaction and patient outcomes.

Radiologists communicate directly with patients during diagnostic studies, including mammograms and interventional procedures. In most situations, primary care physicians, surgeons, and other health professionals are responsible for sharing “bad news” with patients, explaining the implications of test results and responding to patients’ questions and emotional reactions to learning about diagnoses that will affect their lives. A notable exception is the diagnostic mammography suite, where the radiologist may be the first health professional to explain abnormal findings that significantly affect patients’ health and well-being.

Since the passage of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992, radiologists must communicate with women about mammography results in a timely and comprehensible fashion ( ). Sending a written report directly to patients has became a well-established standard in mammography practices. This standardization of result notification has improved patient satisfaction, but has not altered patient anxiety or comprehension of results, particularly the need for surgical consultation or biopsy ( ). Diagnostic follow-up of abnormal screening mammograms also remains problematic. Approximately 9% of women (∼1 million women) interviewed during a large national survey reported knowing about an abnormal mammogram but had received no follow-up, although more than 90% had health insurance and access to health care ( ). The relative contribution of patient-provider interactions and systems-related factors to this problem is unknown.
