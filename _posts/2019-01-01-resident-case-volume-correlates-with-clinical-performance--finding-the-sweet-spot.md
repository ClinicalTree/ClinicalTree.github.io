## Rationale and Objectives

To determine whether the total number of studies interpreted during radiology residency correlates with clinical performance as measured by objective criteria.

## Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of three graduating classes of radiology residents from a single residency program between the years 2015–2017. The total number of studies interpreted by each resident during residency was tracked. Clinical performance was determined by tracking an individual resident's major discordance rate. A major discordance was recorded when there was a difference between the preliminary resident interpretation and final attending interpretation that could immediately impact patient care. Accreditation council for graduate medical education milestones at the completion of residency, Diagnostic radiology in-training scores in the third year, and score from the American board of radiology core exam were also tabulated. Pearson correlation coefficients and polynomial regression analysis were used to identify correlations between the total number of interpreted films and clinical, test, and milestone performance.

## Results

Thirty-seven residents interpreted a mean of 12,709 studies (range 8898–19,818; standard deviation \[SD\] 2351.9) in residency with a mean major discordance rate of 1.1% (range 0.34%–2.54%; stand dev 0.49%). There was a nonlinear correlation between total number of interpreted films and performance. As the number of interpreted films increased to approximately 16,000, clinical performance ( _p_ = 0.004) and test performance ( _p_ = 0.01) improved, but volumes over 16,000 correlated with worse performance.

## Conclusion

The total number of studies interpreted during radiology training correlates with performance. Residencies should endeavor to find the “sweet spot”: the amount of work that maximizes clinical exposure and knowledge without overburdening trainees.

## **INTRODUCTION**

Residency education in diagnostic radiology continues to evolve. Over the past several years, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has made major changes to the program requirements for graduate medical education in diagnostic radiology. Some of these revisions have included increasing the amount of training that residents undergo prior to taking independent call (from 6 months to 12 months) and adding formal requirements for scholarly activity, patient safety, and quality improvement. Perhaps the most important change, however, has been the shift to education delivery centered on the six general competencies: patient care, medical knowledge, practice based learning and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems based practice ( ). In accordance with the next accreditation system, the ACGME implemented educational milestones in July 2013 to help program directors and core faculty evaluate and track residents’ performance across these competencies ( ). Milestones are descriptions of the goals for each competency that residents are expected to demonstrate as they progress through training. While milestones provide a framework, the ACMGE cautions that they should not be used as the only set of tools for assessing competency ( ). To aid programs in assessing competency, many Residency Review Committees for proceduralbased specialties, therefore require minimum case or procedural volumes. For example, the RRC for General Surgery requires a minimum of 850 cases for graduation ( ). In a similar light, the RRC for radiology instituted minimum numbers for certain radiologic studies that each resident must interpret over the course of their residency training (  Table 1 ).
