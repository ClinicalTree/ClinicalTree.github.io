## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to quantify resident anxiety when beginning independent call and to assess whether an apprenticeship experience (buddy call) can lessen anxiety and improve confidence.

## Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort comparison of two groups of radiology residents beginning independent call, one of which was provided with a buddy call experience, was performed. Anxiety and confidence were assessed using the Endler Multidimensional Anxiety Scales–State (EMAS-S), with total score, autonomic emotional, and cognitive worry components, and a five-point, Likert-type scale, respectively. Both groups were asked about the perceived value of a buddy call experience.

## Results

EMAS-S scores improved significantly over 5 days of call in both groups (control, _n_ = 10, _P_ = .0005; buddy call, _n_ = 9, _P_ = .0001), and image interpretation confidence correspondingly increased (control, _P_ = .0004; buddy call, _P_ = .003). Compared to the control group, autonomic emotional scores were significantly lower in the buddy call group on the first day of independent call ( _P_ = .040), and cognitive worry and total EMAS-S scores were significantly lower on day 5 (both _P_ values = .03). Buddy call was independently associated with improved autonomic emotional and film interpretation confidence scores (both _P_ values = .02). All members of the buddy call group indicated that the experience was very helpful in preparing for call.

## Conclusions

Beginning independent call is associated with high anxiety, and buddy call reduces that anxiety, beyond the effect of time alone. Residents who participated in buddy call found it helpful in preparing for independent call. These findings support the use of buddy call and tiered call structures as means to introduce junior residents to independent call.

Residency is stressful. The impact of the stresses faced by residents has been well documented, with several studies showing high levels of depression and anxiety among residents and worsening mood over the course of residency . Resident stress has also been demonstrated to have negative physiologic effects and to have an adverse impact on job performance . One of the most stressful components of residency is overnight call. Trainees are expected to operate increasingly independently, and the limits of their knowledge and organizational skills are tested. Despite the high stress associated with overnight call, the call experience is a necessary and valuable part of residency training, as it allows residents to make independent decisions and to develop confidence in their skills.

Anecdotally, senior residents report that the stresses of call diminish with time. Despite this natural acclimatization, some residency programs can also provide support for junior residents at the beginning of their call experience to reduce the initial stress. Clinical residencies may support junior residents by scheduling them for call with senior residents, knowing that the availability of a more experienced colleague for consultation can provide security for junior trainees. Similarly, some radiology residencies have adopted a model in which junior residents work alongside senior residents before they begin independent call (a “buddy call” system). Although a preliminary apprenticeship may ease the transition to independent call, it is resource intensive, because several residents are assigned to perform a task that might be accomplished by a single trainee. To our knowledge, there are no published data that demonstrate whether such apprenticeship experiences reduce resident stress during subsequent independent call.
