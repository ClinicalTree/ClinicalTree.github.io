This is a first-edition comprehensive text of magnetic resonance imaging of musculoskeletal tumors and tumorlike lesions. The intended audience includes residents, fellows, radiologists, pathologists, and orthopedic surgeons. The author, Dr. Meyers, is a staff radiologist at the University of Rochester with fellowship training in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and neuroradiology. He has contributed to another text, _Differential Diagnosis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging_ , coauthoring the “Brain” and “Spine” sections.

The text is very well organized into three sections: Introduction, Differential Diagnosis Tables, and Atlas. The first section is brief and introduces the reader to MR imaging of tumors, covering the basics of image acquisition, tumor staging, and classification based on the 2002 World Health Organization classification system. Statistics related to each tumor are presented in many easy to understand tables. The section also includes a concise discussion of the features used evaluate and characterize musculoskeletal tumors.

The second section, Differential Diagnosis Tables, comprises 20 differential diagnosis lists that are organized based on anatomic location and MR characteristics. The differential diagnosis tables have two separate columns for each lesion, one to describe the MR image or other pertinent radiographic findings and one for comments on key imaging or clinical features. Each lesion is illustrated with very high-quality multisequence MR images and description of findings. References to the third section of the book are included with each lesion.

The third section, Atlas, has 77 individual chapters for each bone and soft-tissue tumors, organized in alphabetic order. This section provides a comprehensive analysis of each entity with regards to pathology, frequency, location, clinical presentation, plain film/computed tomographic and MR image findings, differential diagnosis, and prognosis/treatment. There are numerous high-quality plain film, computed tomographic, and MR images for each entity to illustrate the range of imaging characteristics.

This is an excellent, beautifully illustrated, well-written, very well-organized text of MR bone and soft-tissue tumors. The image quality is absolutely superb throughout the entire text with 2976 illustrations. Effort was made to reference the most current literature, which is cited for easy reference. The book is useful for learning MR imaging features, studying for boards, generating a differential diagnosis, and referencing a particular entity. This book would be an excellent resource for residents, fellows, radiologists, pathologists, and orthopedic surgeons. Any MR image reading room would benefit from a copy of this book.
