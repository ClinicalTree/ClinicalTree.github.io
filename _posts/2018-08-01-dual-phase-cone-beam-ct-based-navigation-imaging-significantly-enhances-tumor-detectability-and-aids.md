## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of a dual-phase cone-beam computed tomography (DP-CBCT)-based navigation imaging during transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a perspective randomized study.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-two patients with HCC (39 men, 57 ± 9 years, 13 first-time TACE) underwent TACE using three-dimensional image guidance with automatic detection of tumor-feeding vessels computed from DP-CBCT (early and delayed arterial phases). Forty-nine other patients with HCC (44 men, 55 ± 12 years, 14 first-time TACE) were treated conventionally using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Tumor detectability in DP-CBCT was compared to DSA and preoperative CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Tumor-feeding vessel visibility was rated (good, fair, and poor) intraoperatively by the operators. The superselective embolization success rate, the number of DSA acquisitions, fluoroscopy time, and patient radiation dose were collected and compared using paired _t_ test and the Mann-Whitney _U_ test.

## Results

Tumor detection of DP-CBCT was superior to DSA (100% vs 83%, _P_ = .001) and comparable to CT-MR (96%, _P_ = .456). Tumor and feeder visibilities were significantly enhanced by DP-CBCT ( _P_ < .001). Compared to using DSA, more superselective embolization was achieved (60% vs 49%) with less DSA acquisitions ( _n_ = 2.6 ± 0.8 vs n = 3.4 ± 0.7, _P_ < .001) and shorter fluoroscopy time (4.1 ± 2.6 vs 7.1 ± 4.2 minutes, _P_ < .001) with a slight increase in patient radiation exposure, that is, air kerma (median: 0.33, first to third quartiles: 0.24–0.48 vs 0.30, 0.24–0.44 Gy; _P_ = .519) and dose-area product (134, 92–181 vs 97, 75–140 Gy⋅cm  2 , _P_ = .048).

## Conclusions

DP-CBCT and navigation imaging improve tumor detectability and superselective embolization in TACE.

## Introduction

With its high prevalence and poor prognosis due to hepatic impairment and high recurrence rates, liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the world. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), an effective interventional radiological therapy against tumor growth, is provided to patients with unresectable liver cancer and has been reported with potential benefit in patient survival .

One of the keys to successful TACE lies in seeing and reaching tumor lesions after accurate and comprehensive assessment of all feeding arteries. Conventionally, operators rely on fluoroscopy and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, the intrinsic two-dimensional nature of DSA and its low-contrast resolution limit tumor detection, resulting in a recent adoption of intraprocedural cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for its axial and three-dimensional (3D) volumetric visualization, as well as superior soft tissue sensitivity . Clinical findings have reported that CBCT is superior to DSA and can achieve a degree of intraprocedural liver cancer detection comparable to preprocedural diagnostic CT or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging . The subsequent development of dual-phase cone-beam computed tomography (DP-CBCT) with single-contrast injection has further improved tumor detection from single-phase CBCT . Furthermore, the automated feeding artery identification of the DP-CBCT navigation software has been reported with a tumor-feeder detectability rate of 85%–93%, which is a significant improvement over DSA and CBCT .
