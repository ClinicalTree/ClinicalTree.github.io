Following upon the outstanding success of the first educational issue of _Academic Radiology_ , the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology (AMSER) and the Alliance for Clinician Educators in Radiology (ACER) are pleased to bring you another entire issue of the journal dedicated to educational research and scholarship. Thanks again to Dr. Stanley Baum, Dr. Richard Gunderman, and to the leadership of AMSER and ACER for their support and continued encouragement! In this issue, we are pleased to include many articles describing the latest and innovative methods useful in todays' education of medical students, residents, and trainees. The themes covered in this issue align with the AMSER missions that include encouraging excellence in radiologic education during medical school and establishing radiology as an essential component of medical school education . These parallel the ACERs missions that include promoting and developing educational research activities for clinician educators . Having an annual issue devoted to educational scholarship will also help the joint AMSER and ACER missions to promote development and dissemination of resources for medical education and to develop and nurture medical student and clinician educators in the field of radiology .

On the theme of trainee engagement, Chen and Lewis describe an innovative and practical scheme for educating and engaging senior medical students, while relieving busy radiology residents of some of the on-call work pressures, which was a valuable clinical experience for the medical students, while at the same time, benefitting workflow for on-call radiology residents. Educational methodology has to evolve with the times, and we are now in the 21st century with the “Millennials” currently undergoing residency training . Audience response systems (ARS) in hardware (using physical clickers) and software versions have been around for a couple of decades now. How they are used can influence the educational outcome. Dr. Michael Richardson shares his experience of interactive lecturing and advice on getting the most out of ARS to improve attentiveness and engagement in the classroom .

There is pressure from our clinical colleagues for increased hours of in-house coverage by emergency and other radiology attendings, but little is published on the effects of this greater coverage on resident education. Interestingly, in the Whitley Award–winning survey by Dr. Collins et al. of on-call radiology residents, the effects of having 24/7/365 in-house coverage by emergency radiology faculty on resident education resulted in a shorter turnaround time, with greater faculty feedback but with the consequences of a negative effect on autonomy and educational experience. With regard to training residents in noninterpretative skills, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated that all the core competencies be taught to residents and assessed. Teaching systems-based practice (SBP) remains a challenge and Choudhery surveyed residents in academic radiology programs who cited the lack of time and difficulty finding a mentor as the main obstacles to completing SBP projects while having a formally organized institutional quality improvement process was essential .

For residents trying to improve their diagnostic performance, having a systematic approach is helpful and the Memorial award winners Bailey et al. demonstrated increased confidence and greater use of systematic search patterns in cohorts of junior residents following four musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions using a picture archiving and communication systems (PACS)–based module, compared to cohorts of residents without such a module. Such an initiative could be applied to other modalities and body parts in computed tomography (CT) and MRI, which should help to decrease systematic types of errors in trainees. Part of resident education includes knowledge of ionizing radiation and safety aspects, given that about half of radiation exposure nowadays comes from medical diagnostic radiation. Sadigh et al. surveyed residents in radiology and other specialties to find that knowledge was moderate in radiology residents and lower in other specialties. The findings, although somewhat reassuring, highlight the continued and increased need for continued education regarding appropriate imaging and precautions in our trainees and trainees in specialties that perform procedures using ionizing radiation.

We are under increasing constraints, be they financial, time or otherwise, and Naeger et al. share their positive experience of engaging medical students and using medical student capital, in an innovative scheme involving medical student–created independent learning modules to supplement the radiology clerkship. For educators training residents in mammography interpretation/diagnostic performance, Grimm et al. found that resident sensitivity decreased for cases that experts deemed difficult, whereas resident specificity dropped for cases that residents themselves determined to be difficult. The latter finding is surprising and suggests that educators would need to include a mix of cases that are found difficult by residents and experts to maximize the effect of training on diagnostic performance .

The radiology profession is under pressure to show our added value to patients, providers, insurance companies, and society, and we continue to be under threat from outsourcing and commoditization. We can learn from the initiatives of Webb et al. who illustrate how radiology should take its rightful place in the teaching of ultrasound to the first-year medical students through a practical hands-on module embedded within their anatomy teaching. Simulation has become a very useful (and practical) alternative to the traditional apprenticeship in medical education, allowing trainees' confidence to increase and alleviating anxiety. Sekhar et al. share their experience using an inexpensive phantom to teach residents the technique of percutaneous liver biopsy, which will be applicable and useful to residency programs everywhere.
