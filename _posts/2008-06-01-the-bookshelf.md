In the preface, the author clearly states his objectives for this text—to teach the fundamentals of musculoskeletal ultrasound in an efficient and concise manner. The author states that emphasis should be placed on understanding normal ultrasound anatomy and mastering proper ultrasound technique. The author, a leader in the field of musculoskeletal ultrasound, has successfully achieved this goal.

The text is composed of eight logically organized chapters. The first chapter addresses basic ultrasound concepts, including basic physics, artifacts, technique, and interventional procedures. The second chapter is a discussion of musculoskeletal pathology. Topics within this section include muscle and bone injury, infection, and mass lesions. The remaining chapters are devoted to the major joints of the body. There are chapters on the shoulder, elbow, wrist and hand, hip and thigh, knee, and foot/ankle/lower leg. Each of the joint specific chapters begins with a discussion of the relevant anatomy. Then a detailed explanation of the ultrasound technique for evaluating that specific joint and its surrounding structures is given. A useful examination checklist is provided for each of the major joints. There are numerous images of normal musculoskeletal ultrasound anatomy, as well as very useful images of ultrasound transducer placement. These images prove very useful for guiding the novice sonographer to important structures. Each joint specific chapter concludes with a discussion of the more commonly encountered pathologic processes for that joint. Again, multiple images are included for each pathologic process discussed.

As the concerns regarding patient exposure to ionizing radiation continue to grow, ultrasound will become a more important and more often used imaging modality. _Fundamentals of Musculoskeletal Ultrasound_ provides a great reference for the beginning musculoskeletal sonographer. The strengths of this text include its easy readability, multitude of high-quality images (including color plates), and the examination checklists provided in each joint-specific chapter. The major weakness of this book in part stems from its original goal. The book is intended to be an introduction to the basics of musculoskeletal ultrasound, and therefore it is not an all-inclusive reference. The book places emphasis on ultrasound technique and anatomy. The discussions on the pathologic processes for each joint and interventional procedures are a little lacking. However, the author remedies this by providing an extensive list of references at the end of each chapter. The reader can easily reference these articles and texts for more detailed learning.
