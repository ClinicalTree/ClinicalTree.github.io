## Rationale and Objectives

Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to evaluate response to therapy with increasing interest in having PET provide endpoints for clinical trials. Here we demonstrate impacts of PET measurement error and choice of quantification method on clinical trial design.

## Materials and Methods

Sample size was calculated for two-arm randomized trials with percent change in  18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET uptake as an efficacy endpoint. Two methods of uptake quantification were considered: standardized uptake values (SUVs) and kinetic measures from dynamic imaging. Calculations assumed a 20 percentage point difference in treatment groups’ average percent change, and yielded 80% power at α = 0.05. The range of precision (10%–40%) in PET uptake measures was based on review of the literature. The range of SUV sensitivities (50%–100%) relative to kinetic analyses was based on a study of 75 locally advanced breast cancer patients.

## Results

Sample sizes increased from 8 to 126 as PET precision worsened from 10% to 40% at full measurement sensitivity to true change. In a subgroup with low initial FDG uptake, a sample size of 126 was required under 20% standard deviation using clinical SUVs. More sophisticated imaging quantification could reduce this sample size to 32.

## Conclusions

The dependence of sample size on measurement precision and the sensitivity of imaging measures to true change should be considered in single site and multicenter PET trials to avoid underpowered studies with inconclusive results. Sophisticated PET imaging methods that are more sensitive to changes in uptake may be advantageous in early studies with limited patient numbers.

Multicenter trials are the gold standard for establishing new standards for clinical practice in oncology. There is increasing interest in using positron emission tomography (PET) measures to evaluate response to therapy and provide early and robust endpoints for these clinical trials . Early response endpoints from functional imaging modalities such as PET versus anatomical radiographic measures could allow trial patients to more quickly cross over to an expanding number of salvage therapies following progression. Standardization to reduce measurement error has been suggested to address some known challenges in application of PET in clinical trials ; however, the combined impact of these standards on clinical trial design has not been evaluated. There has also been relatively little study of the impact of the choice of PET image methodology and analysis on study design, especially sample size or study power estimation.

Sample size estimation is an important aspect of study design because it is typically a key driver of trial costs and study duration, especially when patient accrual rates are limited. Sample size requirements are impacted by selected power, significance level, effect size, and measurement error as discussed later in this article. Additional design features such as different classification schemes for response (e.g., European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC; ) or PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (PERCIST; )), group randomization, stratification, or expected attrition may also impact sample size, but these aspects were beyond the scope of this study. An example plot of sample size versus effect size in  Figure 1 shows the impacts of measurement error and expected effect size on sample size. The required sample size of a study will increase with an increase in measurement error or with a decrease in expected effect size (e.g., selecting a 20% response threshold versus 30% in PERCIST , compared to no change on average in a control group) or with a decrease in ability to measure the entire range of change associated with the effect size.

The traditional sample size formula based on the two-sample _t_ -test has a 2 in the numerator and calculates only the number of patients required in one arm. Our sample size equation has a 4 in the numerator to calculate the total sample size required for both arms of the study. The significance level (α, also called the false-positive or type I error rate) is the acceptable probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (declaring a treatment group difference exists when in fact it does not). The power (1-β, or probability of not committing a type II error) is the probability of finding a treatment group difference under the condition of a specific effect size. The effect size (Δ) is the expected treatment group difference, and the response variance (σ  2 ) is the common variance of the response variable in the two groups. Z  α is the standard normal distribution critical value for a two-sided test of size α, and Z  β is the critical value for power of 1-β. Common parameters for randomized Phase II trials are an α of 0.05 and 80% power, which correspond to Z  α = 1.96 and Z  β = 0.84. Under the null hypothesis, the treatments will have equal average change in FDG uptake and Δ = 0. An estimate of variance (σ  2 ) can be determined from review of the literature or may require additional early-phase imaging trials.
