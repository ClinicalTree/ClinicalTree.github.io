## Rationale and Objectives

The current paradigm of cancer diagnosis involves uncoordinated communication of findings from radiology and pathology to downstream physicians. Discordance between these findings can require additional time from downstream users to resolve, or given incorrect resolution, may adversely impact treatment decisions. To mitigate this problem, we developed a web-based system, called RadPath, for correlating and integrating radiology and pathology reporting.

## Materials and Methods

RadPath includes interfaces to our institution's clinical information systems, which are used to retrieve reports, images, and test results that are structured into an interactive compendium for a diagnostic patient case. The system includes an editing interface for physicians, allowing for the inclusion of additional clinical data, as well as the ability to retrospectively correlate and contextualize imaging findings following pathology diagnosis.

## Results

During pilot deployment and testing over the course of 1 year, physicians at our institution have completed 60 RadPath cases, requiring an average of 128 seconds from a radiologist and an average of 93 seconds from a pathologist per case. Several technical and workflow challenges were encountered during development, including interfacing with diverse clinical information systems, automatically structuring report contents, and determining the appropriate physicians to create RadPath summaries. Reaction to RadPath has been positive, with users valuing the system's ability to consolidate diagnostic information.

## Conclusions

With the increasing complexity of medicine and the movement toward team-based disease management, there is a need for improved clinical communication and information exchange. RadPath provides a platform for generating coherent and correlated diagnostic summaries in cancer diagnosis with minimal additional effort from physicians.

## Introduction

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States . Pathology and radiology form the basis of cancer diagnosis, yet the specialties remain isolated, reporting findings independently and often having only minimal communication. The combination of these factors may result in radiologic-pathologic discordance, defined as a discrepancy between imaging and histologic findings . Radiologic-pathologic correlation is utilized in various imaging specialties as a tool to assess the utility of new imaging modalities, to gauge interpretive performance, and to identify radiographic features corresponding to histologic findings . However, correlation in these instances takes place for research or quality assurance purposes, and is generally not a normal part of radiologist or pathologist workflow.

Radiologic-pathologic discordance can be problematic for the ordering clinician, who is left with the task of reconciling the diagnostic conflict . The process of resolution may encompass a spectrum of actions depending on the specific findings, but examples include (1) contacting both the radiologist and the pathologist for clarification of findings; (2) concluding that the computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy retrieved tissue was not representative of the lesion of concern; or (3) accepting the histologic findings as the final diagnosis and mistakenly interpreting an inadequately sampled lesion as benign. Such actions may lead to a false-negative conclusion in which cases of high radiographic suspicion of malignancy are misdiagnosed as benign, leading to delay in diagnosis with subsequent higher treatment costs and worse clinical outcomes . A recent study found a nearly 20% discordancy rate in mammography biopsies, with over 1.2% resulting in delayed diagnosis of a carcinoma . Extrapolated nationally, this type of discordancy was projected to result in 9969 missed diagnoses of malignant disease. Other studies have found similar results in breast imaging with false-negative rates of image-directed core biopsies estimated to be between 1% and 9% .

Free-text Responses to General Questions Regarding the RadPath System ( _n_ = 5)


Question Response What are the problems, if any, with your current workflow for interpreting diagnostic results from Radiology and Pathology? “The direct links on RadPath are helpful as typically one would have to pull up three separate files: the pathology report, the images of the CT biopsy, and the original CT images. This format provided with the correlate is very helpful.”

“The biggest issue is getting the results of molecular analysis.” Could the RadPath display be confusing or cause diagnostic misinterpretation? “I am concerned that if the statement at the top isn't repeated in the appropriate panel, there is a risk that people will miss it.” Are there other features you would like RadPath to have? “…it would be helpful if we knew which nodule was biopsied (i.e., CT showing needle into target).”

“Anticipated date of any outstanding studies.”

CT, computed tomography.
