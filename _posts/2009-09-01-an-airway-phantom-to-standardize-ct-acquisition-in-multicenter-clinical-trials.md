## Rationale and objectives

The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of a phantom to standardize low-dose chest computed tomographic (CT) protocols in children with cystic fibrosis.

## Materials and Methods

Spiral chest CT scans of a Plexiglas phantom simulating airway sizes (internal diameter, 1.1–16.4 mm; wall thickness, 0.4–4.6 mm) in children with cystic fibrosis were obtained using two multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners (GE VCT and Siemens Sensation 64). Quantitative airway measurements from both scanners were compared with micro-CT airway measurements over a range of doses (0.2–1.8 mSv) to evaluate bias and variance of measurements. The effective doses for CT protocols were estimated using the ImPACT CT Patient Dosimetry Calculator.

## Results

Both MDCT scanners were able to accurately measure airway sizes down to 3 mm internal diameter and 1.3 mm airway wall thickness, with errors of <3.5%. ImPACT estimates of effective dose were different for the MDCT scanners for a given peak tube voltage and product of tube current and exposure time. Accuracy and precision were not found to be associated with dose parameters for either machine. Bias in all measurements was strongly associated with airway diameter ( _P_ values < .00001), but the magnitude of bias was small (mean, 0.07 mm; maximum, 0.21 mm). Differences between machines in error components were on the order of a few micrometers.

## Conclusions

The use of a standard airway phantom confirms that different MDCT scanners have similar results within dose ranges planned for potential future clinical trials. Standardized protocols can be developed that adjust for differences in radiation exposure for different MDCT scanners.

To limit the risks of radiation exposure during chest computed tomographic (CT) imaging in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), low-dose spiral and high-resolution chest CT protocols have been developed for both expert reader scoring and quantitative CT measurements, including regional air trapping and airway measurements . These protocols provide comprehensive assessment of lung disease at substantially lower effective doses . Both the radiation exposure and image quality of different CT scanners may be different, even when parameters such as peak tube voltage (kVp), the product of tube current (mA) and exposure time (sec\[s\]), collimation, and pitch are held constant. Hence, a single protocol may not be appropriate for sites using different CT scanners during multicenter trials. Effective dose estimates for different CT scanners are available or can be measured at each site. These estimates or measurements can be used to establish protocols that provide similar radiation exposure for subjects studied using different CT scanners. To evaluate the quantitative measurements produced by such protocols, a standardized airway phantom was developed that could be tested at different sites. This phantom can be used to compare simulated airway measurements over a range of tube voltage, current-time product, collimation, and pitch settings obtained using low-dose protocol settings for each CT scanner and can also be used to correct for the measurement bias for each of these scanners. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the use of a phantom to standardize low-dose chest CT protocols in children with CF using different multidetector CT (MDCT) scanners and different CT dose parameters.

## Materials and methods

A Plexiglas airway phantom was manufactured by Phantom Laboratory, Inc (Salem, NY), modeled after the Plexiglas phantom developed by Reinhardt et al (  Fig 1 ). The phantom models tracheobronchial airway sizes in children and adolescents with CF that are seen with inspiratory chest CT imaging. The airway phantom consists of eight Plexiglas tubes that are encased in a larger Plexiglas cylinder (  Fig 1 ). The sizes of the tubes simulate tracheal, bronchial, and bronchiolar airway sizes encountered in children and adolescents with CF during full-inflation chest CT scans. These airway sizes were developed from our quantitative CT airway measurements evaluating tracheal and first-generation to fifth-generation bronchial and bronchiolar airways obtained in children with CF ages 6 to 18 years (unpublished data) using quantitative CT airway analysis software . The airway sizes specified for the manufacturer were 16, 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 mm internal (luminal) diameters, and the specified wall thicknesses (WTs) were 4.5, 3.5, 2.7, 2.3, 1.8, 1.3, 0.8, and 0.4 mm, simulating quantitative airway measurements from previously encountered airways in CF children (  Supplement Table 1 ). The airspace surrounding the tubes within the larger Plexiglas cylinder was filled with dry puffed-rice cereal, simulating lung parenchyma on full-inflation inspiratory chest CT scans. This corresponded to a density of approximately −885 Hounsfield units (HU), similar to the lung density we have found in children with CF during full-inflation inspiratory CT scans (median density, −873 ± 20.3 HU).
