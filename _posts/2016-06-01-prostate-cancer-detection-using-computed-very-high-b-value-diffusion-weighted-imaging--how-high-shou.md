## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess prostate cancer detection using a broad range of computed b-values up to 5000 s/mm  2 .

## Materials and Methods

This retrospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study was approved by an institutional review board with consent waiver. Forty-nine patients (63 ± 8 years) underwent 3T prostate magnetic resonance imaging before prostatectomy. Examinations included diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with b-values of 50 and 1000 s/mm  2 . Seven computed DWI image sets (b-values: 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, and 5000 s/mm  2 ) were generated by mono-exponential fit. Two blinded radiologists (R1 \[attending\], R2 \[fellow\]) independently evaluated diffusion weighted image sets for image quality and dominant lesion location. A separate unblinded radiologist placed regions of interest to measure tumor-to-peripheral zone (PZ) contrast. Pathologic findings from prostatectomy served as reference standard. Measures were compared between b-values using the Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test, Spearman correlation coefficient, and generalized estimating equations based on logistic regression for correlated data.

## Results

As b-value increased, tumor-to-PZ contrast and benign prostate suppression for both readers increased ( _r_ = +0.65 to +0.71, _P_ ≤ 0.001), whereas anatomic clarity, visualization of the capsule, and visualization of peripheral-transition zone edge decreased ( _r_ = −0.69 to −0.75, _P_ ≤ 0.003). Sensitivity for tumor was highest for R1 at b1500–3000 (84%–88%) and for R2 at b1500–2500 (70%–76%). Sensitivities for both pathologic outcomes were lower for both readers at both b1000 and the highest computed b-values. Sensitivity for Gleason >6 tumor was highest for R1 at b1500–3000 (90%–93%) and for R2 at 1500–2500 (78%–80%). The positive predictive value for tumor for R1 was similar from b1000 to 4000 (93%–98%) and for R2 was similar from b1500 to 4000 (88%–94%).

## Conclusions

Computed b-values in the range of 1500–2500 s/mm  2 (but not higher) were optimal for prostate cancer detection; b-values of 1000 or 3000–5000 exhibited overall lower performance.

## Introduction

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) plays a central role in prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) interpretation, being designated as the dominant sequence for guiding localization and risk assessment of focal peripheral zone (PZ) lesions in the American College of Radiology Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 guidelines . When performing DWI using conventional b-values up to 1000 s/mm  2 , the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map serves as the primary image set for interpretation. In comparison, unsuppressed signal within benign prostate tissue obscures potential hyperintensity within tumors on the acquired DWI at such b-values . Although higher b-value DWI yields greater benign tissue suppression and thus potential improved tumor visualization, direct acquisition of such b-values is technically difficult because of issues related to reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and increased anatomic distortion and artifacts resulting from increased eddy currents at these b-values .

A number of studies report techniques entailing novel pulse sequences and parameter optimization for improving distortion and artifacts of high b-value DWI . However, an alternative approach is to perform “computed” DWI, in which the very high b-value images are mathematically derived from the ADC map without being actually acquired themselves . This scheme is intended to provide the benign prostate signal suppression of acquired very high b-value images while avoiding the challenges of low SNR and increased artifacts that are encountered when directly acquiring such images. Although computed high b-value DWI does not acquire additional diffusion data compared to the standard b-values, this post-processing technique may in practice improve visual conspicuity of tumors, without requiring any increase in scan time. Indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated significantly improved prostate cancer detection using computed b-values up to 2000 . Furthermore, PI-RADS v2 formally acknowledges the role of computed DWI in multiparametric prostate MRI and incorporates findings at the very high b-values into its lesion assessment categories .
