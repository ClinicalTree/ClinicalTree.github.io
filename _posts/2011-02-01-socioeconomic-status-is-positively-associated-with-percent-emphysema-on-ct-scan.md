## Rationale and Objectives

Higher socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with lower respiratory mortality and better lung function, but whether a similar gradient exists for computed tomography (CT) measures of subclinical emphysema is unknown.

## Materials and Methods

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) recruited African-American, Chinese, Hispanic, and white participants, ages 45 to 84 years, without clinical cardiovascular disease, from six US sites between 2000 and 2002. The MESA Lung Study assessed percent emphysema, defined based on the proportion of pixels below an attenuation threshold of 910 HU from lung windows of cardiac CT scans. Generalized linear models were adjusted for demographic characteristics, height, body mass index, history of respiratory illness, occupational and residential exposures, tobacco use, and CT scanner type.

## Results

Among 3706 participants with a mean age of 61 (±10), the median value for percent emphysema was 18 (interquartile range = 20). Compared with those who did not complete high school, participants with a graduate degree had a higher percent emphysema (difference of 4; _P_ < .001). Income and wealth were also positively associated with percent emphysema. In contrast, higher SES was associated with better lung function. Descriptive and subgroup analyses were used to explore potential explanations for divergent results, including the possibility that suboptimal inspiration during CT scanning would decrease percent emphysema, making the lungs appear healthier when effort is relatively poor.

## Conclusion

Although SES indicators were positively associated with subclinical emphysema detectable on CT scan, this unexpected association may highlight potential bias because of effort dependence of both CT measures and spirometry.

Socioeconomic disparities for respiratory mortality may be comparable to or larger than disparities for other major causes of death . A strong socioeconomic gradient has also been observed for subclinical respiratory health measures such as lung function . Suggested mechanisms for such an association include not only smoking and tobacco exposure , but also occupational and neighborhood exposures , obesity , and stress .

Socioeconomic status (SES) may also be associated with subclinical emphysema measured with computed tomography (CT), but no previous studies have assessed this relationship in a large, population-based sample. Subclinical emphysema is moderately correlated with but distinct from impaired lung function. We hypothesized that greater educational attainment, income, and wealth would be associated with less emphysema-like patterns on CT scans.

Values shown are regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals for an additional increment of a grouped linear variable with a range of 0 through 4 for education (less than a high school education; high school degree; some college; completed college; graduate degree), income (lowest quintile, <$9000 per person annually; highest quintile, >$40 000 per person annually) or wealth (no wealth indicators reported; only one indicator reported; two indicators reported; three indicators reported; car ownership, home ownership, financial investments, and real estate investments all reported); and the difference between extreme categories can be calculated by multiplying difference coefficient by 4.
