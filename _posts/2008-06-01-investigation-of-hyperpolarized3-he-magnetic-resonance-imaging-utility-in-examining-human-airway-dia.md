## Rationale and Objectives

Application of a previously developed model-based algorithm on hyperpolarized (HP)  3 He magnetic resonance (MR) dynamic projection images of phantoms was extended to investigate the utility of HP  3 He MR imaging (MRI) in quantifying airway caliber changes associated with asthma.

## Materials and Methods

Airways of seven volunteers were imaged and measured using HP  3 He MRI and multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) before and after a methacholine (MCh) challenge. MDCT data were obtained at functional residual capacity and 1 L above functional residual capacity.

## Results

Comparison of the resultant data showed that HP  3 He MRI did not match MDCT in measuring the ratios of airway calibers before and after the MCh challenge in 37% to 43% of the airways from the first six generations at the two lung volumes tested. However, MDCT did yield the observation that 49% to 69% of these airways displayed bronchodilation following MCh challenge.

## Conclusion

The current implementation of HP  3 He MRI did not match the MCh-induced postchallenge-to-prechallenge airway caliber ratios as measured with MDCT. Elevated parenchymal tethering due to bronchoconstriction-induced hyperinflation was proposed as a possible explanation for this airway dilation.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has been the imaging modality of choice for assessing airways in asthma studies ( ). Numerous algorithms have been developed to process the acquired computed tomographic data ( ). Sophisticated software has been successfully developed for the visualization and three-dimensional (3D) rendering of the airway tree ( ). However, the use of ionizing radiation makes computed tomography (CT) undesirable in the event that repeated imaging is necessary to follow the progress of disease.

Hyperpolarized (HP)  3 He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to visualize ventilation distribution in both animals ( ) and humans ( ) during breathhold of HP  3 He. HP  3 He MRI has also been used to visualize the airways by acquiring the MR images as the gas travels down the respiratory airway tree of both animals ( ) and humans ( ). HP  3 He MRI was able to observe correlations between ventilation dropouts and airways with low MR signal in broncho-challenged human subjects. Whether HP  3 He MRI could be an effective tool in evaluating airway constriction/dilation in asthmatics has become a subject of interest ( ).
