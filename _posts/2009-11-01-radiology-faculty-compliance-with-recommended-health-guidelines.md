## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to determine diagnostic radiology faculty members' compliance with recommended health guidelines for physical activity, body weight, diet, and related health indicators and to compare faculty members' compliance with that of radiology residents.

## Materials and Methods

A request to complete an online health survey was electronically sent to members of the Association of University Radiologists in September 2008. Results were compared to those from a similar survey completed by radiology residents in May and June 2007. Frequency counts and Fisher's exact tests were used to summarize results and to determine statistically significant relationships.

## Results

The sample consisted of 193 of 801 members of the Association of University Radiologists (24%). A greater percentage of faculty members than residents complied with recommendations for physical activity (52% vs 37%, _P_ < .001) and the consumption of vegetables (67% vs 52%, _P_ < .001), saturated fat (51% vs 37%, _P_ < .001), and sodium (53% vs 37%, _P_ < .001). A greater percentage of faculty members felt that they got enough sleep (51% vs 38%, _P_ = .002) and did not think about stress on most days (39% vs 26%, _P_ = .001). Most faculty members (59%) worked 51 to 60 hours a week, whereas most residents (59%) worked >60 hours, and greater work hours were correlated with less resident physical activity ( _P_ = .017). More female than male faculty members (78% vs 57%, _P_ = .010) and residents (83% vs 62%, _P_ < .001) had body mass indexes < 25 kg/m  2 .

## Conclusion

A substantial percentage of faculty members were out of compliance with federal health guidelines, although less so than residents in many categories. Comments from both groups suggest a possible benefit from modifications to the work environment.

A previous study showed that a substantial number of residents were out of compliance with federal guidelines for physical activity and diet and were not knowledgeable about their personal dietary intake. It also showed that long work hours (>60 hours a week) were significantly correlated with less physical activity. The authors suggested that radiology programs might be able to influence residents' health practices by modifying work hours and the working environment, encouraging healthy dietary intake and physical activity, and instituting campaigns to inform residents and faculty members about health guidelines and available wellness programs. The authors also made the point that radiology faculty members serve as role models to residents, potentially influencing the choices trainees make regarding their health. The purposes of this study were to determine radiology faculty members' compliance with recommended health guidelines for physical activity, body weight, diet, and related health indicators and to compare the results with those of radiology residents.

## Materials and methods

A previously published online survey composed of 58 forced-choice items and one open-ended question was slightly modified to be relevant to radiology faculty members. Items were related to demographics (age and gender), engagement in physical activity, diet, body mass index (BMI), cholesterol level, blood pressure, hours of sleep, work hours, work-related stress, the availability of workplace wellness programs, and work-related injuries (ie, ergonomic-related injuries). The items related to age and professional status were modified from the original survey.
