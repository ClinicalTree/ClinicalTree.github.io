This text provides a wonderful collection of 200 cases as a review for anyone preparing for the radiology oral board examination. Dr Huisman, with four additional radiologists, has selected appropriate images with relevant questions to help the reader focus on critical aspects of each case. The following page provides the answers and additional commentary with references for further reading.

The cases are organized by level of difficulty (three levels). The images are of excellent quality, despite the absence of color. All modalities are included, with state-of-the-art techniques. All areas of pediatric radiology are included (neurologic, cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal). The discussions that are included in every case are the strength of this review text; they are succinct and include high-yield facts as well as management issues.

Those studying for the radiology oral board examination would find this book most useful, but medical students, pediatric radiology fellows, and practicing radiologists may also find this text a helpful resource.
