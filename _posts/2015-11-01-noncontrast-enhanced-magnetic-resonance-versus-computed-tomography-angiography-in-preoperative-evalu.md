## Rationale and Objectives

Living renal donors undergo an extensive examination program. These examinations should be as safe, gentle, and patient friendly as possible. To compare computed tomography angiography (CTA) and an extensive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol without contrast agents to observations from nephrectomy in living renal donors and to evaluate whether noncontrast-enhanced MRI can replace CTA for vessel assessment in living renal donors.

## Material and Methods

CTA and MRI results were compared to observations from nephrectomy, which served as the reference standard. Fifty-one potential kidney donors underwent imaging, and 31 donated a kidney. Comparisons in sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were made with respect to the number of arteries, early branching, and the number of veins. Agreement was assessed using Cohen's kappa. The exact McNemar's test was used to test for statistically significant differences.

## Results

In the assessment of more than one renal artery, the sensitivity and specificity of MRI and CTA were high and in perfect agreement compared to observations from surgery. The results for both MRI and CTA were as follows: (sensitivity 100%/specificity100%/accuracy 100%/Kappa = 1/ _P_ = 1). When comparing the ability to test for early branching we found, MRI: (sensitivity 33%/specificity 100%/accuracy 87%/Kappa = 0.45/ _P_ = 1) and CTA: (sensitivity 50%/specificity 100%/accuracy 90%/Kappa = 0.62/ _P_ = 1). When used to depict supernumerary veins, we found MRI: (sensitivity60%/specifivity100%/accuracy 93%/Kappa = 0.72/ _P_ = 1), whereas CTA showed: (sensitivity 40%/specificity 96%/accuracy 87% Kappa = 0.43/ _P_ = 1).

## Conclusions

In conclusion, an optimized MRI protocol that includes noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography can be substituted for CTA for preoperative assessment of the renal vessels before living donor nephrectomy.

Renal transplantation is considered the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease. Because of a lack of organs, an increasing number of kidney transplantations are performed with kidneys from living donors, which results in longer graft survival . The laparoscopic approach has become popular for nephrectomy because it has a lower complication rate, less postoperative pain, and shorter hospital stay than open donor nephrectomy . The potential donors are healthy and often younger people who undergo a program of examinations purely to exclude disease and to clarify the renal vascular anatomy for nephrectomy planning. Because of a high frequency of anatomic variations, some guidelines recommend assessing potential donors with imaging, including renal angiography . The importance of detailed description of the anatomy and pathology before living renal donation has been emphasized . Obviously, the screening program for living kidney donors should be as noninvasive and gentle as possible. Arterial imaging is important because the presence of multiple arteries may increase the operation time, and accessory lower pole arteries are associated with a higher rate of recipient ureter complications . Older studies have compared angiography to surgery, but few recent studies have been performed . Past studies have reported that contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CEMRA) can replace digital subtraction angiography (DSA) but has suboptimal accuracy in detecting small accessory arteries . Only a few studies have compared computed tomography angiography (CTA) and CEMRA in living kidney donors. Although in some cases CEMRA was shown to be preferable, in most cases CEMRA was inferior to CTA in detecting small accessory arteries . CEMRA has been compared with results from living donor nephrectomy, and it was shown to be a reliable imaging technique for the assessment of the renal vasculature with performance comparable to that of CTA . With surgery serving as the reference standard, CEMRA has identical accuracy to CTA in characterizing renal vascular anatomy . Two previous studies compared a noncontrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocol that included noncontrast-enhanced MR angiography (NCMRA) to CEMRA (with results from surgery used as the reference standard) and found that MRI without contrast agents can reliably depict renal vascular anatomy and serve as an alternative to CEMRA in the screening of living kidney donors .

Thus, there is inconsistency in the literature as to whether noncontrast-enhanced MRI has sufficient quality for preoperative assessment of potential renal donors. Recent improvements in MRI and NCMRA sequences that enable better and faster imaging have led us to hypothesize that an MRI protocol that includes NCMRA and other sequences to highlight anatomy and pathology might now be a valuable alternative to CTA and allow subjects to avoid the risks associated with radiation exposure and contrast injections .
