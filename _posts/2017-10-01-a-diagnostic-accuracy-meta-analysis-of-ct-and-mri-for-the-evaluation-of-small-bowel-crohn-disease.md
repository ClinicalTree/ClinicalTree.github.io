## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in assessing small bowel (SB) Crohn disease (CD).

## Materials and Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Elsevier, ScienceDirect, Karger, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library, and Springer for studies in which CT or MRI were evaluated to assess SB CD. Bivariate random effect meta-analytic methods were used to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic curves. Diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) in a per-patient–based analysis were estimated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was also calculated to measure the diagnostic accuracy.

## Results

Twenty-one studies involving 913 patients were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant difference observed between modalities. The diagnostic performances (lnDOR) for CT and MRI also showed no significant difference. Subgroup analysis was performed for MR imaging (MR enteroclysis, MR enterography, and CT enterography). The diagnostic performances (lnDOR) for MR enteroclysis, MR enterography, and CT enterography did not show a significant difference among them. No significant difference was found between these techniques. Deeks funnel plot asymmetry test for publication bias showed that no significant publication bias was observed in this analysis.

## Conclusions

This meta-analysis suggests that both MRI and CT have high diagnostic accuracy in detecting SB CD. MRI has the potential to be the first-line radiation-free modality for SB CD imaging.

## Introduction

Crohn disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of great diagnostic challenges, with an incidence of approximately 100–200 per 100,000 in North America and Europe, and a total of 400,000–600,000 patients in North America . The small bowel (SB) is the most commonly affected site, and it is the only affected site in around 30% of cases . Many new imaging tools are available in clinical practices for the evaluation of SB disorders. Among those, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) techniques are playing an important role for SB imaging. The previously established SB barium enteroclysis and barium follow-through are gradually being shifted toward MR enteroclysis and enterography, and CT enteroclysis and enterography.

One of the major differences between MRI and CT is in radiation dose for detection. MR enterography and MR enteroclysis require no or only a trivial dose, whereas CT enteroclysis and CT enterography require a large radiation dose around 10–15 mSv , although studies showed a lower dose (under 9 mSv) used in patients with CD . Some research estimated that the lifetime risk for an adult patient to acquire a fatal cancer from radiation is 1 in 20,000 per mSv , whereas a study showed that in 15% of patients with CD, the cumulative effective radiation dose was more than 75 mSv, which could increase the cancer mortality by as much as 7.3% . Some studies have compared CT and MRI in patients with CD, but the results were variable and controversial. This meta-analysis from published data aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the diagnostic accuracy of these imaging modalities for SB CD.
