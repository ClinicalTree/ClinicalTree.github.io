## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to design a pulse sequence that suppresses methemoglobin and is applicable in a 0.3-T permanent magnet.

## Materials and Methods

Blood samples were collected from six healthy volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with a 0.3-T scanner until the typical signal intensities of methemoglobin were obtained. Each blood sample was then scanned using repetition times of 300, 600, 900, 1200, 1500, and 1800 ms and a constant echo time of 20 ms. All other parameters (field of view, slice thickness, matrix, and number of signal averages) were kept constant for all six sequences. Signal intensities and repetition time data were used to calculate the T1 relaxation time of extracellular methemoglobin. T1 was determined by ordinary least square regression according to the equation _S_ = _k_ (1 − e  −repetition time/T1 ), where _S_ is signal intensity and _k_ is the proportional constant. A short tau inversion recovery sequence with an inversion time calculated from the T1 value of methemoglobin was used on fat, water, and methemoglobin blood samples and in 11 patients diagnosed with subacute brain hemorrhages. The inversion time was calculated as ln2 T1 (tissue), where T1 is the relaxation time of extracellular methemoglobin to be suppressed.

## Results

The T1 relaxation time of extracellular methemoglobin was determined to be 231.24 ± 9.068 ms, and inversion time was calculated to be 160 ± 6.67 msec. Application of an inversion time of 160 ms showed complete suppression on extracellular methemoglobin blood samples and all of the 11 subjects.

## Conclusion

A methemoglobin suppression technique using an inversion time of 160 ± 6.67 ms is applicable in a 0.3-T permanent magnet.

Magnetic resonance (MR) suppression techniques are gaining importance in imaging because they allow the perturbation of tissue contrast to enhance the signal from tissues of greater interest. Fat and water are the two tissues commonly suppressed in clinical practice. Methemoglobin suppression is not as popular as fat and water suppression, because blood products of varying ages can produce a rather confusing appearance . We are unaware of any studies in which blood (methemoglobin) was suppressed using 0.3-T magnets. We therefore undertook this study to design a pulse sequence that suppresses extracellular methemoglobin and to test it on patients with subacute hemorrhages.

## Materials and methods

This was a prospective, single-institution study approved by our hospital's institutional review board.
