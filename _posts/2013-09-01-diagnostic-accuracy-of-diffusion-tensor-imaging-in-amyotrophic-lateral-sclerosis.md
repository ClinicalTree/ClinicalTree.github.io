## Rationale and Objectives

There have been a large number of case-control studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The objective of this study was to perform an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis for the estimation of the diagnostic accuracy measures of DTI in the diagnosis of ALS using corticospinal tract data.

## Materials and Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases (1966–April 2011) were searched. Studies were included if they used DTI region of interest or tractography techniques to compare mean cerebral corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy values between ALS subjects and healthy controls. Corresponding authors from the identified articles were contacted to collect individual patient data. IPD meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using Stata. Meta-regression covariate analysis included age, gender, disease duration, and Revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale scores.

## Results

Of 30 identified studies, 11 corresponding authors provided IPD and 221 ALS patients and 187 healthy control subjects were available for study. Pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66–0.83), pooled sensitivity was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62–0.75), and pooled specificity was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.66–0.80). Meta-regression showed no significant differences in pooled AUC for each of the covariates. There was moderate to high heterogeneity of pooled AUC estimates. Study quality was generally high. Data from 19 of the 30 eligible studies were not ascertained, raising possibility of selection bias.

## Conclusion

Using corticospinal tract individual patient data, the diagnostic accuracy of DTI appears to lack sufficient discrimination in isolation. Additional research efforts and a multimodal approach that also includes ALS mimics will be required to make neuroimaging a critical component in the workup of ALS.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal degenerative motor neuron disease involving the motor cortex, corticospinal tract (CST), and spinal anterior horn neurons. Clinical presentation of the disease is variable, contributing diagnostic uncertainty and delay . More than 40% of ALS patients undergo inappropriate medical treatment, including surgery . Electromyography can help confirm the diagnosis of lower motor neuron involvement. There is a high interest in developing upper motor neuron diagnostic biomarkers to facilitate an accurate diagnosis at an earlier stage .

A promising biomarker for ALS is diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), an advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) application. Fractional anisotropy (FA), a scalar measurement of water diffusivity, is a key DTI metric. FA reductions have been reported in diseases that degrade white matter tracts, including ALS . Although several studies have reported FA decreases in ALS patients, only a few have addressed test accuracy measures with relative small subject numbers . We have recently completed a group-level meta-analysis of test accuracy measures of DTI for the diagnosis of ALS . However, individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis approaches are generally considered superior to group-level approaches because more rigorous statistical methods can be employed, including covariate adjustment . Our study objective was to compare ALS patients who underwent DTI to healthy controls to determine diagnostic accuracy measures of FA using IPD meta-analysis techniques.

The vertical axis expresses study size, as measured by standard error (SE). Studies with larger standard errors have a wider confidence interval. The graphed vertical line represents the observed mean AUC and the dashed lines represent the 95% confidence limits for the expected distribution for published studies. The points represent the observed distribution of the published studies. Visual inspection demonstrates the presence of publication bias with several of the studies outside the 95% confidence limits. Further, the plot demonstrates that studies with larger standard errors have lower test performance (ie, AUC).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DiagnosticAccuracyofDiffusionTensorImaginginAmyotrophicLateralSclerosis/6_1s20S1076633213002584.jpg)
