## Rationale and Objectives

To identify micro–computed tomography (CT) imaging biomarkers for evaluating the effects of emodin, a potential drug to treat osteoporosis, in the mouse model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated osteoporosis.

## Materials and Methods

Forty male imprinting control region (ICR) mice with LPS-induced bone resorption were equally divided into four experimental groups: phosphate-buffered saline–treated (control), emodin-treated, LPS-treated, and LPS + emodin–treated groups. Emodin (50 mg/kg) was administered orally on alternate days for 8 days, and LPS (5 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally on days 1 and 4. After 8 days, the mice were sacrificed, and micro-CT images of the left proximal femurs were obtained. Three-dimensional images were analyzed by using commercial software to measure the bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb-N), trabecular thickness (Tb-Th), and trabecular separation (Tb-Sp) as CT imaging biomarkers. Histologic analyses of the femurs were performed using hematoxylin and eosin and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) immunohistochemical staining.

## Results

The LPS + emodin–treated group demonstrated marked suppression of LPS-induced bone resorption compared to the LPS-treated group (BV/TV, 28.84% vs. 40.76%; Tb-N, 2.65 vs. 3.45 mm  −1 ; Tb-Sp, 300.81 vs. 212.31 μm; Tb-Th, 116.94 vs. 131.25 μm). TRAP immunohistochemical analysis showed fewer osteoclasts per field of tissue in the LPS + emodin–treated group than in the LPS-treated group (27.8 vs. 41.8). The BV/TV, Tb-N, and Tb-Sp data correlated well with the histomorphometric findings.

## Conclusions

The findings reveal a novel effect of emodin on bone remodeling in the LPS-mediated osteoporotic mouse model. The ex vivo micro-CT imaging is a promising tool for assessing the therapeutic effects of potential drugs on osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a bone disorder characterized by bone mass decline and trabecular architecture deterioration, leading to increased bone fragility and risk of spontaneous fracture . An imbalance in bone remodeling, a physiological process characterized by bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts, causes most of the adult skeletal diseases including osteoporosis . The literature includes many studies of bone remodeling to prevent and overcome osteoporosis.

Emodin (3-methyl-1,6,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a natural compound present in the roots and bark of numerous plants of the genus _Rhamnus_ , a herb widely used as a laxative in traditional Chinese medicine . It reportedly has a variety of biological activities, such as anticancer, vasorelaxative, immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties . The effect of emodin on bone remodeling has been studied in vitro: it was found to have a beneficial effect on bone health with anabolic activity to prevent osteoporosis . However, no study on the pharmacologic role or biologic effects of emodin has been performed in an animal model until now.

On the contrary, the LPS + emodin–treated group demonstrates restored BV/TV and Tb-N as well as Tb-Sp. These data suggested that emodin reveals marked suppression effect of LPS-mediated bone resorption. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in Tb-Th among all four groups (d) , implying Tb-Th was not affected after intraperitoneal LPS injection on this study.
