## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study is to determine the role of magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) in the early period of Parkinson disease (PD).

## Materials and Methods

Clinically diagnosed 33 patients with PD in the first year of diagnosis, and 30 healthy volunteers were assessed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed without and with magnetization transfer (MT) imaging. Signal intensity measurements were obtained from 15 anatomic regions (substantia nigra pars compacta \[SNPC\], substantia nigra pars reticulate \[SNPR\], red nucleus, dentate nucleus, cerebellum, pons, globus pallidus, putamen, caudate nucleus, thalamus, internal capsule posterior horn, forceps major, forceps minor, and genu and splenium of corpus callosum) and MTR was calculated. Comparisons of the findings between each anatomic location of the patients with PD and normal subjects were performed.

## Results

Most prominent decrease of MTR was found in SNPC ( _p_ < 0.001). A significant decrease of MTR was also found in the SNPR ( _p_ = 0.006), red nucleus ( _p_ = 0.037), and pons ( _p_ = 0.046). The other regions lack significance.

## Conclusion

MTR analysis is a useful technique for initial PD assessment. Even in the first year of diagnosis, significant reduction of MTR is found in substantia nigra, red nucleus, and pons compared with that of the control group.

Parkinson disease (PD) is a slow neurodegenerative process with progressive neuronal loss of pigmented nuclei, prominently in substantia nigra (SN) ( ). Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may demonstrate signal changes or thickness reduction of SN ( ), which is insufficient on the diagnosis of presymptomatic patients and the progress of the disease. Thus new studies are needed to diagnose the presymptomatic patients for admission of neuroprotective agents in early treatment ( ). Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) imaging, a technique based on interactions between protons that reside in a relatively free environment and those where motion is restricted, is reported to be sensitive on myelin destruction and axonal loss ( ). The purpose of our study is to asses the MTR MRI in the early period of PD disease and to compare the findings with those in normal healthy volunteers.

## Materials and methods

Clinically diagnosed 33 patients with PD (age range 46–82 years; mean 66.9 ± 8.49; 9 females, 24 males) and 30 healthy volunteers (age range 42–78 years; mean 66.8 ± 8.575; 15 females, 15 males) were included prospectively and consecutively in the study.
