## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine an optimum standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold for identifying regional nodal metastasis on  18 F–fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomographic (PET)/computed tomographic (CT) studies of patients with inflammatory breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

A database search was performed of patients newly diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer who underwent  18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging at the time of diagnosis at a single institution between January 1, 2001, and September 30, 2009. Three radiologists blinded to the histopathology of the regional lymph nodes retrospectively analyzed all  18 F-FDG PET/CT images by measuring the maximum SUV (SUVmax) in visually abnormal nodes. The accuracy of  18 F-FDG PET/CT image interpretation was correlated with histopathology when available. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess the diagnostic performance of PET/CT imaging. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated using three different SUV cutoff values (2.0, 2.5, and 3.0).

## Results

A total of 888 regional nodal basins, including bilateral axillary, infraclavicular, internal mammary, and supraclavicular lymph nodes, were evaluated in 111 patients (mean age, 56 years). Of the 888 nodal basins, 625 (70%) were negative and 263 (30%) were positive for metastasis. Malignant lymph nodes had significantly higher SUVmax than benign lymph nodes ( _P_ < .0001). An SUVmax of 2.0 showed the highest overall sensitivity (89%) and specificity (99%) for the diagnosis of malignant disease.

## Conclusions

SUVmax of regional lymph nodes on  18 F-FDG PET/CT imaging may help differentiate benign and malignant lymph nodes in patients with inflammatory breast cancer. An SUV cutoff of 2 provided the best accuracy in identifying regional nodal metastasis in this patient population.

Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive disease that accounts for 1% to 5% of all breast cancers. It is a clinicopathologic entity characterized by changes in the breast such as erythema, edema involving more than two thirds of the breast, peau d’orange, enlargement, warmth, tenderness, and induration on palpation . In general, compared to women with noninflammatory breast cancer, women with IBC present at a younger age, are more likely to have metastatic disease at diagnosis, and have shorter overall survival . The mean 5-year overall survival rate of patients with IBC who have undergone current multidisciplinary therapy is between 20% and 40% .

The most significant prognostic factor for women with IBC is axillary lymph node involvement. Patients with axillary lymph node metastasis have shorter disease-free and overall survival than patients with node-negative disease . Accurate preoperative staging of patients with IBC is vital, because the standard of care for these patients is neoadjuvant therapy prior to mastectomy and surgical removal of the lymph nodes, after which histopathologic information about the number of involved axillary lymph nodes and the actual size of the primary tumor is no longer available.
