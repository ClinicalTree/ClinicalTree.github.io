## Rationale and Objectives

This study evaluates the opinions and knowledge of fourth-year US medical students regarding radiology and analyzes the influence of a required or nonrequired radiology rotation as a reflection of the effectiveness of radiology medical student education.

## Methods and Materials

Our institutional review board granted exempt status. An invitation e-mail was sent to 137 US medical schools. Upon receiving approval a second email was sent containing our voluntary anonymous online survey hyperlink to forward to their fourth-year class. Survey topics included demographics, radiology educational experiences, attitudes toward the field, and basic radiology knowledge. Responses were collected between August 4 and September 26, 2011.

## Results

A total of 444 fourth-year medical students from 37 medical schools participated: 89% planned to enter a nonradiology specialty, 10.8% were required to take a dedicated radiology rotation, 34.9% completed one, 77% planned to complete one by graduation, 88.4% thought radiology often changes patient care or is at least as important as physical exam, 91.4% underestimated the cancer risk of an abdomen and pelvis computed tomography by at least one order of magnitude, and 72.9% by at least two orders. Seventy-seven percent had never heard of the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria. Respondents underestimated the potential risks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); with 58.3% aware intravenous gadolinium can cause nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and 79.4% aware of potential injury from metallic projectiles. 40.4% indicated that non-radiologist clinicians in specific medical specialties interpret their respective imaging studies at least as accurately as corresponding subspecialty radiologists. Other results include student opinions regarding teleradiology, radiologist lifestyle, and compensation.

## Conclusions

Fourth-year medical students recognize the importance of radiology but are poorly informed regarding radiation safety, MRI safety, and ACR Appropriateness Criteria, despite 34.9% having a dedicated rotation. This highlights the need for adoption of the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology curriculum.

Medical student radiology education is a vital part of medical training, both to promote the effective and judicious use of radiology resources and to increase awareness of the field. The effectiveness of such training has been evaluated predominantly in single institution studies and not across multiple US centers. The field of radiology and radiology education has changed since many of these studies were published. We sought to determine if medical student opinions and knowledge of radiology and the influence of a dedicated radiology rotation has changed over the past decade across the United States.

Previous studies have suggested that a radiology clerkship improves both medical student opinion of the role of radiology as well as ability to choose an appropriate workup. A 4-week radiology clerkship increased student desire for a radiologist to be involved in patient care and consultation . Students selected more appropriate imaging in survey scenarios, with projected lower costs after a radiology clerkship than before . Students with some preclinical exposure to radiologists were less likely to hold negative stereotypes of radiologists . In the 10 years or more since most of these studies were published, there have been many changes in the field of radiology. There has been a trend toward integrating radiology into the core curriculum by several different strategies. These include adding half-day web-based independent teaching sessions to each of 10 fourth-year clerkships , adding subspecialty faculty lectures during the internal medicine clerkship , and integrating radiology throughout the third year curriculum with readings, shadowing, didactic sessions, radiology rounds, final exam, and case presentations . There has been an increased public awareness of radiology's role in US population radiation exposure and a dramatic rise in the cost of health care . During this time the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria was converted from text-based guidelines to an on-line database . The effectiveness of radiology medical student education since these changes and trends have occurred has not been evaluated across multiple US medical schools.
