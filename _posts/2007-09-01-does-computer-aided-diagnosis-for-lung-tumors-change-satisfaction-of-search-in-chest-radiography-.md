## Rationale and Objectives

Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been developed to ensure that the radiologist considers suspect focal opacities that may represent cancer in chest radiography. Although CAD was not developed to counteract the satisfaction of search (SOS) effect, it may be an effective intervention to do so. The objective of this study is to determine whether an idealized CAD can reduce SOS effects in chest radiography.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-seven chest radiographs, half of which demonstrated diverse, native abnormalities were read twice by 16 observers, once with and once without the addition of a simulated pulmonary nodule. Simulated CAD prompts were provided during the interpretation, which unerringly pointed to the _added_ simulated nodule. Area under the ROC curve for detecting the native abnormalities was estimated for each observer in each treatment condition. In addition to testing for the SOS effect in the presence of CAD prompts, results were compared to those of a previous SOS study.

## Results

Significantly more nodules were reported in the SOS with CAD experiment than in the original SOS experiment (49 versus 43, _P_ < .01). An SOS effect was found even when CAD prompts were provided; ROC areas for detecting native abnormalities were reduced with added nodules \[0.68 versus 0.65, _P_ (one-tailed) < .05\]. Comparison of the current experiment with CAD and the previous SOS experiments failed to show a significant difference of the magnitude of the SOS effect ( _P_ = .52). The threshold for reporting was more conservative with CAD prompts than in SOS studies ( _P_ = .052).

## Conclusion

Our results indicate that the CAD prompts, even those that always point to their target lesion without false-positive error, fail to counteract SOS in chest radiography. The stricter decision thresholds with CAD prompts may indicate less visual search for native abnormalities.

Satisfaction of search (SOS) occurs when a lesion is “missed” after detecting another lesion in the same image. An SOS effect in chest radiology, defined operationally as a reduced accuracy in detecting native abnormalities on chest radiographs in the presence of simulated pulmonary nodules, has been demonstrated ( ).

A promising approach to prevent SOS errors in medical imaging diagnosis is computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). CAD has been used to find tumors on chest radiographs, chest computed tomography, and mammograms. The goal of computer-aided diagnosis for nodule detection is to ensure that the interpreting physician considers regions that have a high probability of disease. An obvious radiology examination in which to study the effects of CAD on SOS is chest radiography. Not only have SOS effects on the detection of lung nodules and other abnormalities been quantified ( ), CAD systems for nodule detection in chest imaging are also well developed and commercially available ( ).

> “Some of the cases you will read will be completely normal and others will contain one or more clinically significant abnormalities. We are interested only in those features that represent significant abnormality. Avoid “over calling”. A list of features to generally ignore is posted next to the alternator and is also included in your scoring booklet. There is a separate response sheet for each case presented. The top of the response sheet lists the alternator position, the patient’s age and sex, and sometimes a comment about some attribute of the film we would like you to ignore. At the bottom of the response sheet there is a photostat representing a PA view of the case (and sometimes a lateral view). On some PA views there will be a CAD indication of the location of a potential pulmonary nodule (white dot). Please review this area on the film and reject or accept this indication by checking the appropriate box. If you accept the CAD indication, circle your confidence that the feature is abnormal. Otherwise, leave the CAD section blank. Continue describing other abnormal features on the film. As you do, number them and draw their locations on the photostat, give a likely diagnosis if possible and rate your confidence (one to four) that the feature is abnormal. The rating categories are, 1) suspicious, but probably normal; 2) possibly abnormal; 3) probably abnormal; and 4) definitely abnormal. If you find no abnormal features, check the box on the response sheet indicating, “normal features, nothing to report” and proceed to the next case.”
