## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively assess the incremental value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) combined with T2-weighted images (T2WI) in determining the T stage of bladder cancer by using pathologic findings as the reference standard.

## Materials and Methods

This study is approved by the institutional review board; informed consent was waived. The study includes 362 patients (age range, 48–87 years; mean, 71 years) who underwent 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging and histologic examination. Three observers with varying experience levels reviewed the T2WI data alone, DWI data alone, and combined T2WI and DWI data. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) were determined with the Z test after adjusting for data clustering.

## Results

For differentiating Tis to T1 tumors from T2 to T4 tumors, the AUCs for T2WI and DWI (0.97 for observer 1 and 0.96 for observer 2) were greater than those for the DWI alone (0.92 for observer 1 and 0.90 for observer 2) ( _P_ < .05). Observer 3 had similar AUCs for T2WI and DWI compared to DWI alone. The accuracy of T2WI and DWI (observer 1, 98%; observer 2, 96%; observer 3, 92%) was greater than that of DWI alone (observer 1, 92%; observer 2, 90%; observer 3, 87%) for all observers ( _P_ < .05). The specificity of T2WI and DWI (observer 1, 100%; observer 2, 98%; observer 3, 93%) was greater than that of DWI alone (observer 1, 92%; observer 2, 90%; observer 3, 87%) for all observers ( _P_ < .05). Sensitivity was not improved even when T2WI and DWI were used. For differentiating Tis to T2 Tumors from T3 to T4 Tumors, the overall accuracy, specificity, and AUC for diagnosing T2 or higher stages were not significantly improved by combiningT2WI and DWI.

## Conclusions

T2WI combined with DWI can be a reliable sequence for preoperative evaluation of T stage urinary bladder cancer. It is particularly more useful in differentiating T1 or lower tumors from T2 or higher tumors compared to DWI alone.

Bladder cancer (BC) is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. BC causes 14,880 deaths per year in the United States . Clinical management of urinary BC is determined primarily on the basis of distinguishing superficial tumors (stage T1 or lower) from muscle-invasive tumors (stage T2 or higher), as proper treatment options differ considerably between these two stages. Superficial tumors are treated with transurethral resection (TUR) with or without adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy , whereas invasive tumors are treated with radical cystectomy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination . Therefore, preoperative imaging studies play an important diagnostic role in precisely differentiating between the two categories of BC.

Computed tomography (CT), as the preferred method for the staging of BC, has high accuracy in the diagnosis of BC . However, it cannot reliably determine the depth of tumor invasion into the bladder wall, the involvement of adjacent organs, or the presence of nodal disease . In addition, the high radiation exposure and the need for an ionizing contrast agent encourage the use of other imaging modalities for muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) staging . The reported magnetic resonance (MR) staging accuracy for bladder carcinoma ranges from 72% to 96% . Staging is improved with gadolinium enhancement . However, accurate staging with imaging techniques is difficult because of the thinness of the bladder wall, which accounts for the difficulty in distinguishing superficial invasion (pT2a) from deep muscle invasion (pT2 b) and deep muscle invasion from minor tumor extension into perivesical fat (pT3a) .
