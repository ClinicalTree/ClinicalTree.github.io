Informa Healthcare's very portable book _Multi-detector Computed Tomography in Oncology: CT Perfusion Imaging_ was a refreshing book for me to review. It is very well organized and extremely interesting, and it managed to combine history, science, and everyday clinical practice (at least for some of us) into one very compact book. In particular, it was very interesting to begin with introductory chapters on the history of computed tomographic (CT) perfusion that discuss Greek philosophers. I guess when they said it was “a historical perspective,” they really meant it! I sincerely loved this part of the book and found that it flowed very well (and quickly) into the science of computed tomography (CT) and CT perfusion, which seemed like an excellent organizational choice. As well, I found it very interesting to see fluid dynamics, including differential calculus, so well intertwined into a book that seemed to be aimed at clinical radiologists. From there, the book segues into various clinical applications of CT perfusion (of oncologic diagnoses), and there is probably something in here for everyone that uses or would like to use CT perfusion. In particular, this book would be most helpful to anyone trying to learn about CT perfusion from the start, how it works, and how it is currently “best” used given what experience and the literature have taught us about it.

The book is very well illustrated and the chapters and index are easy to manage in terms of being able to pick up the book and go right to the part that interests you. That being said, one of the great benefits this book brings is that it is an excellent combination of source textbook, reference book, and literature review—this one book could serve many purposes on your bookshelf and is easily transported in a bag or into the reading rooms for easy reference, whenever and wherever needed.

As delineated in the title, the focus of this book is CT perfusion of oncologic diagnoses but it includes more than just oncology-specific aspects of CT perfusion. Given that, I think that it does an excellent job of covering oncologic CT perfusion; it is likely that oncologic imaging is a large part of your current practice and, furthermore, I anticipate that it will be even more so in the future. Perhaps this book can help you. I would like to believe that it can and will.
