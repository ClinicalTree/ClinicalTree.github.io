## Rationale and Objectives

Thyroid nodules are common in the population, although the rate of malignancy is relatively low (5%–15%). The purpose of this study was to determine if introducing a modified standardized reporting format and management algorithm (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System \[TI-RADS\]) affects radiologist reporting adherence, number of thyroid biopsies, and other measurable outcomes.

## Materials and Methods

All thyroid biopsies performed over two 6-month periods were evaluated at a tertiary care hospital with Research Ethics Board approval. The first period was before implementation of TI-RADS and the second was several months after implementation of TI-RADS (using a modified version made through a multidisciplinary collaboration). The number of biopsies performed was determined in each of the two periods as well as the percent of positive malignancy, wait times, and rates of non-diagnostic/unsatisfactory and inconclusive biopsies, which included atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS).

## Results

The average number of biopsies performed prior to implementing modified Kwak's TI-RADS was 74 thyroid biopsies per month and the average number of diagnostic ultrasounds was 271. After the introduction of modified Kwak's TI-RADS, the average number of thyroid biopsies decreased to 60 per month (an 18.9% reduction, _P_ < .05), and the number of diagnostic ultrasound increased to 287 per month (a 5.9% increase from 2016 to 2017). The average wait time for a thyroid biopsy decreased from 5 to 3 weeks ( _P_ < .05). There was a slight increase in the rate of positive malignancy results (from 15% to 18%), although it was not statistically significant. The rate of non-diagnostic/unsatisfactory and inconclusive results (including AUS and FLUS) remained unchanged (18% AUS/FLUS/15% non-diagnostic/unsatisfactory before and 17% AUS/FLUS/15% non-diagnostic/unsatisfactory after TI-RADS introduction, _P_ > .05).

## Conclusions

Introduction of a multidisciplinary-approved standardized reporting system with evidence-based management recommendations led to no statistically significant change in the number of diagnostic ultrasounds but a statistically significant reduction in the number of monthly thyroid biopsies and associated reduction in wait times.

## Introduction

Studies have estimated that up to 67% of North Americans have thyroid nodules but that of these nodules only 5%–15% will be malignant . There has been a 2.4-fold increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in the past 30 years; this increase in diagnosis is commonly considered to result from better technology and more frequent use of cross-sectional imaging . Despite an increase in overall thyroid diagnosis, the 5-year mortality rate for thyroid cancer has been stable at a relatively low 5%–7% since 2005 . Some studies estimate that up to 50% of thyroid cancers will remain indolent over a patient's life time .

With more thyroid nodules being detected, emphasis should be placed on consistent imaging technique, template reporting use, and standardized management recommendations by radiologists. One of the main challenges in this sequence of events is determining which nodules require biopsy and which ones are better left alone (  Fig 1 ). A further concern is discerning which _part_ of heterogenous nodules requires biopsy (  Fig 1 ).
