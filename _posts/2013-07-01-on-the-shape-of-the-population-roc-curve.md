## Rationale and Objectives

Human observers often do not produce empirical operating points near the northeast corner of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot, and thus the local shape of the population ROC curve is unknown.

## Materials and Methods

We call attention to occult abnormalities and propose that considerations by human observers of the prior probability of occult abnormalities can cause the shape of the local population ROC curve to be convex, a straight line, or concave near the northeast corner of the ROC plot. We further conducted a set of simulated detection-task (without-search) experiments with human observers and, mathematically, with an ideal observer and a model observer. In the experiments, we used signals, pseudo-signals that were similar to signals, and random image noise. The relative frequency of occult signals was controlled in the experiments.

## Results

In the simulated experiments, the population ROC curve of the ideal observer was always convex, but those of the model observer and of human observers were convex, a straight-line, or concave, depending on the relative frequency of occult signals. The population ROC curve for the model observer was identical to that for the ideal observer when knowing the relative frequency of occult signals was not important for the ideal observer, and it was similar to that for human observers otherwise.

## Conclusion

Observer consideration of the prior probability of occult abnormalities is important in ROC studies and could cause unexpected shapes of the local population ROC curve. Absence of empirical operating points near the northeast corner of the ROC plot may be caused by occult abnormalities.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis is widely used for characterizing the decision-making performance in binary discrimination tasks, particularly those that involve medical imaging systems and expert human observers such as radiologists . An important goal of ROC analysis is to obtain an estimate of the population ROC curve based on empirical operating points (ie, sensitivity-specificity pairs) derived from a radiologist's confidence ratings that a specified abnormality is present in each case of a set of images. It has long been known that empirical operating points tend to be absent near the northeast corner of the ROC plot . An example of this is the Digital Mammography Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST) . In the data shown in  Figure 1 , the large space near the northeast corner of the ROC plot that is devoid of empirical operating points can be problematic for parametric ROC curve estimation, and the conventional and the proper binormal models can yield quite different ROC curve estimates.
