## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the ultrasound features of thyroid nodules and their association with malignancy, focusing on establishing feature-oriented ultrasound criteria to determine proper management of a thyroid nodule.

## Materials and Methods

A sample of 379 thyroid nodules were biopsied (from a total of 357 patients aged 59.8 ± 14.8 years) and 300 were included in the final study (271 benign nodules and 29 malignant ones). Ultrasound features were recorded for each nodule: size, echogenicity, homogeneity, contours, shape, texture, peripheral halo, calcifications, and the presence of adenopathy. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test and chi-square test. The sensitivity and the specificity of variables seen to have a statistically significant association with the malignancy of nodules were assessed and a logistic regression was performed.

## Results

A taller-than-wide shape, an ill-defined contour, the presence of a halo, microcalcifications, and adenopathy were found to have a statistically significant relationship ( _P_ < 0.05) with malignancy, although with a low sensitivity and a high specificity. The presence of at least one suspicious feature yields great sensitivity (89.7%) in detecting malignant disease.

## Conclusions

The ultrasound features of thyroid nodules alone do not allow the radiologist to make a confident diagnosis regarding the malignancy of a nodule without performing a biopsy. However, a nodule showing a taller-than-wide shape, microcalcifications, a peripheral halo, an ill-defined contour, or associated adenopathy should be considered for cytology.

## Introduction

There is an increasing rate of diagnosis of thyroid nodules in the general population, much due to the widespread availability of ultrasound equipment and better health care worldwide . Up to two-thirds of the general population has thyroid nodules at an ultrasound examination. Although only a small percentage of nodules are malignant, prognosis for patients with thyroid cancer is good, attaining a 5-year survival rate of 98.1% in the United States, mainly related to the early diagnosis of small lesions .

Ultrasound examination, although very sensitive in identifying thyroid nodules, lacks the accuracy to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules . Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) technique under ultrasound guidance is the most used method to obtain biologic material from a thyroid nodule, leading to a definite benign or malignant result in about 90% of cases .
