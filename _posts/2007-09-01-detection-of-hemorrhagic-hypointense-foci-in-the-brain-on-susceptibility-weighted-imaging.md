## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the sensitivity of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for depicting hemorrhagic hypointense foci of the brain in comparison with gradient-recalled echo (GRE)- and GRE-type single-shot echo-planar imaging (GREI, GRE-EPI), and to assess the basic characteristics of the susceptibility effect by using a phantom.

## Materials and Methods

We prospectively examined 16 patients (9 males, 7 females, aged 10–74 years, mean 43 years) with hypointense foci using SWI, GREI, and GRE-EPI at a 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) unit. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), sensitivity to small hypointese foci, and artifacts were evaluated. To assess the basic characteristics of SWI, we performed a phantom study using different concentrations of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO).

## Results

The CNR of lesions was significantly greater for SWI than the other images ( _P_ < .0001). SWI detected the greatest number of small hypointense foci, even in the near-skull-base and infratentorial regions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses in our clinical and phantom studies demonstrated that the degree of artifacts was similar with SWI and GREI.

## Conclusion

SWI was best for detecting small hemorrhagic hypointense foci. Artifacts of SWI were similar to GREI.

The detection of hemorrhage and its breakdown products is important for the diagnosis, management, and prognostic prediction for a variety of intracranial diseases ( ). Cerebral microhemorrhage may be a marker of cerebral small-vessel disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy and might indicate a higher risk for future intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis or the use of antithrombotic drugs ( ). The detection of hemorrhage on magnetic resonance (MR) images is useful for the grading of gliomas ( ). In patients with diffuse axonal injury, the presence of hemorrhage may result in a poor prognosis ( ).

Among various imaging techniques for depicting intracranial microhemorrhage, two-dimensional T2\*-weighted gradient-recalled echo imaging (GREI) is considered a reliable technique ( ). In the detection of small hemorrhagic foci in the supratentorial white matter, however, GRE-type single-shot echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) may be more sensitive than GREI ( ).

![Figure 4, A 62-year-old man with multiple cavernous angiomas. Upper and lower images in left and middle portions are continuous two 5-mm-thick GREI and GRE-EPI images, respectively. An image in right portion is a 10-mm-thick SW image corresponding to the level of the GREI and GRE-EPI images. ( A ) Small hypointense foci are more clearly seen on the SW image. The delineation of the lesion (diameter > 5 mm) near the left trigone of the lateral ventricle ( arrows ) exhibits a ‘blooming’ effect on GRE-EPI and SW images. A small hypointense lesion adjacent to this lesion is seen only on GRE images ( arrowhead ). Delineation of the lesion on GRE, GRE-EPI, and SWI images was scored as grade 3, 0, and 0, respectively. Small arrows indicate areas that had been operated previously. ( B ) In regions adjacent to the skull base or the posterior fossa, small hypointense foci are more pronounced on the SWI image. GRE, GRE-EPI, and SWI images were scored for artifacts as grade 3, 1, and 2, respectively.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DetectionofHemorrhagicHypointenseFociintheBrainonSusceptibilityWeightedImaging/3_1s20S1076633207002577.jpg)
