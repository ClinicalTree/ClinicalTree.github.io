## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to investigate the utility of problem-solving breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for mammographic Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 3 and 4 microcalcifications.

## Materials and Methods

Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011, 138 women with 146 areas of categories 3 and 4 microcalcifications without sonographic correlates underwent breast MRI and had a stereotactic core biopsy using an 11-gauge needle or follow-up at least for 24 months. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated on the basis of BI-RADS category, with categories 1–3 being considered benign and categories 4 and 5 being considered malignant.

## Results

Twenty-four cases (16.4%) were malignant (18 ductal carcinoma in situ, 6 invasive). MRI increased PPV and specificity from 43% to 68% and from 80% to 93% ( _P_ = .054 and .005) compared to mammography. Within 102 category 3 microcalcifications, 5 carcinomas were assessed correctly as category 4 by MRI. Within 44 category 4 microcalcifications, a correct diagnosis was made by MRI in 77% (34 of 44) as opposed to 43% (19 of 44) by mammography, and 80% (20 of 25) of unnecessary biopsies could have been avoided. Within the 24 carcinomas, 5 were negative at MRI. MRI-negative carcinomas have a significantly higher possibility of being low grade (ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive) ( _P_ = .0362).

## Conclusions

Breast MRI has the potential to improve the diagnosis of category 3 or 4 microcalcifications and could alter indications for biopsy. Breast MRI could help predict the presence or absence of higher-grade carcinoma for category 3 or 4 microcalcifications.

## Introduction

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for patients with newly diagnosed breast carcinoma and for high-risk screening . However, there is no clear consensus on the use of MRI for “problem-solving” purposes in cases of inconclusive mammographic or ultrasound findings. Because positive predictive values (PPVs) of screening mammography and ultrasound have been reported to be only 18.4%–31.0% and 6.7%–13.2% , respectively, it would be desirable to reduce the number of biopsies that yield benign results. Although the performance of problem-solving breast MRI has been reported to be excellent for noncalcified lesions , reported results of those for microcalcifications are inconsistent , and only few studies used a large dataset including Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categories 3 and 4 microcalcifications.

Previous studies evaluating the role of MRI in the diagnosis of microcalcifications suggested that false-negative carcinomas at MRI are low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) , although the characteristics of such cases were not further investigated in these studies. The results suggest that low-grade carcinomas negative at MRI might be biologically unimportant , and MRI could be used for microcalcifications at least to detect high-grade carcinomas.
