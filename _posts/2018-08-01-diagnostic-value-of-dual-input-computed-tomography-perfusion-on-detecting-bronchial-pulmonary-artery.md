## Rationale and Objectives

This prospective study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dual-input computed tomography perfusion technique (DI-CTP) in identifying the bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula in patients tuberculosis with massive hemoptysis.

## Material and Methods

Twenty patients with tuberculosis with massive hemoptysis were enrolled from January 2015 to December 2015. The association between DI-CTP parameters and the diagnostic outcomes of digital subtraction angiography was assessed. Diagnostic efficacy of DI-CTP was evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses using the diagnostic outcomes of digital subtraction angiography, which is the gold standard for identifying bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula.

## Results

Compared to lung segments with normal blood flow ( _n_ = 304), those with bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula ( _n_ = 164) had a reduced pulmonary flow value, perfusion index (PI) value, and an elevated bronchial artery (BF) value in the DI-CTP scan, which was further confirmed by multivariate logistic regression. ROC analysis showed that PI and bronchial artery has an excellent diagnostic performance (both area under the ROC curve > 0.9, _P_ < .001) and high sensitivity and specificity (from 0.79 to 0.95 at the optimal cutoff). PI has the best diagnostic performance, with an overall diagnostic accuracy of 0.91.

## Conclusions

DI-CTP scan possesses the diagnostic value for detecting bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula in patients with tuberculosis with massive hemoptysis, providing an alternative diagnostic method.

## Introduction

Massive hemoptysis is a life-threatening condition which is most frequently defined as the expectoration of an amount of blood >300 mL within a period of 24 hours . Tuberculosis is one of the most common causes of hemoptysis , and bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula is an important pathologic mechanism for massive hemoptysis in patients with tuberculosis .

Conventional diagnostic methods for hemoptysis include chest radiography, bronchoscopy, multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography (MDCTA), and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) . Chest radiography and bronchoscopy are considered to be the primary methods for diagnosis of hemoptysis and for identifying the source of bleeding, but both the sensitivities are relatively low . MDCTA can provide a comprehensive assessment of pulmonary vascular morphology and the potential causes of hemoptysis before bronchial arterial embolization (BAE) . However, the sensitivity of MDCTA for identifying bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula is relatively low because it is incapable of dynamically showing the abnormal blood flow in the bronchial and pulmonary artery and vein fistula, as well as simultaneously displaying the fine vascular structures in the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchial artery . Currently, DSA is the gold standard for identifying bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula . Nevertheless, DSA is limited by its invasiveness and high cost. Therefore, it is required to develop an alternative or auxiliary diagnostic method for locating the bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula in patients with massive hemoptysis.

![Figure 1, The time-density curves (TDCs) of the pulmonary artery (1), pulmonary parenchyma (2), left atrium (3), and descending aorta (4) were shown. The peak enhancement time point of the left atrium (between the peaks of pulmonary artery and bronchial artery) was used to distinguish the pulmonary and bronchial circulation. In the normal physiological state, the TDCs of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary parenchyma were highly similar, indicating that pulmonary circulation was dominant in the normal pulmonary parenchyma.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DiagnosticValueofDualinputComputedTomographyPerfusiononDetectingBronchialPulmonaryArteryFistulainTuberculosisPatientswithMassiveHemoptysis/0_1s20S1076633217305238.jpg)

![Figure 2, Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed that region of interest (ROI) 1 was the tuberculosis focus in the middle lobe of the right lung, and ROI 2 and ROI 3 were the normal pulmonary parenchyma. The comparisons for the value of dual-input CT perfusion parameters in the three ROI were as follows: PF (2 > 3 > 1), BF (1 > 3 > 2), PI (2 > 3 > 1), suggesting that ROI 1 had a reduced pulmonary flow and an elevated bronchial flow.
