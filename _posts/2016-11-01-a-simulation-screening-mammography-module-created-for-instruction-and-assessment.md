## Rationale and Objectives

To improve mammographic screening training and breast cancer detection, radiology residents participated in a simulation screening mammography module in which they interpreted an enriched set of screening mammograms with known outcomes. This pilot research study evaluates the effectiveness of the simulation module while tracking the progress, efficiency, and accuracy of radiology resident interpretations and also compares their performance against national benchmarks.

## Materials and Methods

A simulation module was created with 266 digital screening mammograms enriched with high-risk breast lesions (seven cases) and breast malignancies (65 cases). Over a period of 27 months, 39 radiology residents participated in the simulation screening mammography module. Resident sensitivity and specificity were compared to Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC data through 2009) national benchmark and American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) acceptable screening mammography audit ranges.

## Results

The sensitivity, the percentage of cancers with an abnormal initial interpretation (BI-RADS 0), among residents was 84.5%, similar to the BCSC benchmark sensitivity of 84.9% (sensitivity for tissue diagnosis of cancer within 1 year following the initial examination) and within the acceptable ACR BI-RADS medical audit range of ≥75%. The specificity, the percentage of noncancers that had a negative image interpretation (BI-RADS 1 or 2), among residents was 83.2% compared to 90.3% reported in the BCSC benchmark data, but lower than the suggested ACR BI-RADS range of 88%–95%.

## Conclusions

Using simulation modules for interpretation of screening mammograms is a promising method for training radiology residents to detect breast cancer and to help them achieve competence toward national benchmarks.

## Introduction

Screening mammography is the only breast imaging modality that is known to reduce breast cancer mortality. Instruction of radiology residents in interpreting screening mammograms is challenging, and participation of radiology trainees in screening mammographic interpretation is a critical component of residency training . This simulation module was created to teach interpretation of screening mammography to residents in training with the overarching goal of increasing breast cancer detection among women. To limit variability of exposure to screening mammography cases as well as to track progress, efficiency, and accuracy of interpretations of screening mammograms, we created an enriched standardized set of digital screening mammograms with known outcomes. Participation in this simulation module allowed radiology residents to obtain immediate feedback and to correlate imaging characteristics with histologic findings. The goal of this module was to improve mammographic screening training and breast cancer detection, as well as to prepare more fully for the rigors of private practice or academic medicine. Additionally, the United States Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) mandates medical audits to track breast cancer outcome data associated with interpretive performance. Practicing breast radiologists regularly review feedback from their audit reports and are able to continually refine their interpretive skills. This screening mammography simulation experience provided residents with a similar objective feedback mechanism and the opportunity to learn about the MQSA medical outcomes audit program and compare their performance against national benchmarks. This pilot research study evaluated the effectiveness of the simulation screening mammography module.

## Materials and Methods

A simulation module was created and modified over a period of three academic years: from 2012 to 2013, from 2013 to 2014, and from 2014 to 2015, from a collection of 266 digital screening mammograms from 2008 to 2009 to provide radiology residents with a standardized set of screening mammograms.
