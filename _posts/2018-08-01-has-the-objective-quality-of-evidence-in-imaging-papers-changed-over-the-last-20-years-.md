## Rationale and Objectives

We aimed to determine if both evidence level (EL) as well as clinical efficacy (CE) of imaging manuscripts have changed over the last 20 years.

## Materials and Methods

With our review of medical literature, Institutional Review Board approval was waived, and no informed consent was required. Using Web of Science, we determined the 10 highest impact factor imaging journals. For each journal the 10 most cited and 10 average cited papers were compared for the following years: 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010, and 2014. EL was graded using the same criteria as the _Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery_ (Wright et al., 2003). CE was graded using the criteria of Thornbury and Fryback (1991). Statistical software R and package lme4 were used to fit mixed regression models with fixed effects for group, year, and a random effect for journal.

## Results

EL has improved −0.03 every year on average ( _P_ < .001). The more cited papers had better ELs (group effect = −0.23, SE 0.09, _P_ = .011). CE is lower in top cited compared to average cited articles, although the differences were not statistically significant (group effect = −0.14, SE = 0.09, _P_ = .16). CE level increased modestly in both groups over this 20-year time period (0.06 per year, SE = 0.007, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Over the last 20 years, imaging journal articles have improved modestly in quality of evidence, as measured by EL and CE.

## Introduction

Government bodies and insurance companies often rely on scientific papers to make best quality care recommendations, which influence reimbursement decisions for medical and imaging procedures. To a large degree, the support for these decisions is based on the scientific strength of evidence available . For example, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence provides “technology appraisal guidance” which includes a systematic review of the available evidence with a preference for higher grade evidence such as randomized controlled trials . UK National Health Service organizations are mandated by law to provide payment for those technologies that have been vetted through this system . In France, Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS), the High Authority of Health, serves a similar role, providing recommendations to UNCAM (Union Nationale des Caisses d'Assurance Maladie), an organization which then uses these recommendations to determine reimbursement rates . Both of these authorities grade the available evidence for a particular treatment or diagnostic modality according to a scale of “evidence level” (EL), with the highest ELs being the most rigorous studies .

In the United States, with a multipayer system, including both government and private entities, reimbursement recommendations are much more complex, and often not generated by the payers themselves . The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is responsible for creating recommendations—which payers can choose to support with reimbursement decisions or not—based upon the available evidence, with graded levels from A-I based upon the strength and quality of the published evidence . Meanwhile, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission makes recommendations on Medicare reimbursements based upon these grades and other quality metrics, with private payers often following suit . These organizations, and others like them, evaluate the quality of research papers based upon several subjective and objective factors, including EL and clinical efficacy (CE) .
