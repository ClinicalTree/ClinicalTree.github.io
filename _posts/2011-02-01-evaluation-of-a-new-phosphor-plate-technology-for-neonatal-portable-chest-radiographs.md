## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate a new thick-needle phosphor plate for computed radiography.

## Materials and Methods

Two studies were performed. Patients acted as their own controls. In the first study, old powder and new needle phosphor plate technologies were compared. Twenty infants were identified who had undergone chest x-rays with both systems within 3 days of each other. Exposure factors were constant. In the second study, standard and reduced exposure techniques (tube current–time product reduced by 20%) using the needle phosphor technology were compared. Twenty babies who had been imaged with both standard and reduced exposures within 3 days of each other were evaluated.

## Results

There was a significant preference for images obtained with the new needle phosphor technology compared with the older powder technology ( _P_ < .01). Using the new needle phosphor plates, a dose reduction of 20% could be achieved without a significant detectable difference between the high-dose and low-dose images ( _P_ < .19).

## Conclusions

For the study comparing old and new phosphor plate technology at fixed exposure, images were better with the new technology. Using the new plate technology, dose can be decreased by ≥20%.

There are many methods of reducing radiation exposure for chest imaging in the newborn nursery. With phosphor plate computer imaging, one approach is to use a different detector material in the phosphor plate.

The Agfa Corporation (Mortsel, Belgium) has developed a new thick-needle phosphor plate technology to replace existing thin powder phosphor plates for computed radiography . Our purpose was to evaluate this new technology.
