## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study is to compare two subjective methods for the identification of changes suggestive of early interstitial lung disease (ILD) on chest computed tomographic (CT) scans.

## Materials and Methods

The CT scans of the first 100 subjects enrolled in the COPDGene Study from a single institution were examined using a sequential reader and a group consensus interpretation scheme. CT scans were evaluated for the presence of parenchymal changes consistent with ILD using the following scoring system: 0 = normal, 1 = equivocal for the presence of ILD, 2 = highly suspicious for ILD, and 3 = classic ILD changes. A statistical comparison of patients with early ILD to normal subjects was performed.

## Results

There was a high degree of agreement between methods (κ = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.94; _P_ < .0001 for the sequential and consensus methods). The sequential reading method had both high positive (1.0) and negative (0.97) predictive values for a consensus read despite a 58% reduction in the number of chest CT evaluations. Regardless of interpretation method, the prevalence of chest CT changes consistent with early ILD in this subset of smokers from COPDGene varied between 5% and 10%. Subjects with early ILD tended to have greater tobacco smoke exposure than subjects without early ILD ( _P_ = .053).

## Conclusions

A sequential CT interpretation scheme is an efficient method for the visual interpretation of CT data. Further investigation is required to independently confirm our findings and further characterize early ILD in smokers.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic interstitial lung disease (ILD), with an estimated 3-year survival rate of 50% . IPF is typically diagnosed 3 to 4 years after the development of symptoms, by which time most patients have advanced pulmonary fibrosis that does not respond to therapeutic intervention. Some authors have speculated that the poor response to medical therapy is due to advanced organ remodeling, although it is unclear, if initation of therapy at the earliest stages of disease would alter its clinical course .

Our group has previously demonstrated both chest computed tomographic (CT) and pathologic evidence of early ILD in asymptomatic members in 18 kindreds affected with familial IPF . These findings suggest that screening high risk populations may, in some cases, detect early subclinical stages of ILD. Although early disease detection may lead to a better understanding of the natural history of IPF, strategies for detection and screening in high-risk populations have not been formally investigated. To address this issue, we compared an efficient sequential reading method to a consensus reading method for the identification of early ILD in a population of smokers (both with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \[COPD\]) enrolled in the COPDGene Study. We report a high degree of correlation between methods and present the comparison of the clinical characteristics of subjects identified as having early ILD in the COPDGene Study.

In sequential analysis, each scan was reviewed in series, and in consensus analysis, each score was agreed on by three simultaneous readers. The number of readings was calculated as the total number of CT interpretations. For the correlation between these two methods, κ = 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.94; _P_ < .0001).
