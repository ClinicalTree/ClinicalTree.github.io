## Rationale and Objectives

Meaningfully measuring physician outcomes and resource utilization requires appropriate patient risk adjustment. We aimed to assess Medicare patient complexity by physician specialty and to further identify radiologist characteristics associated with higher patient complexity.

## Materials and Methods

The average beneficiary Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk scores (Medicare's preferred measure of clinical complexity) were identified for all physicians using 2014 Medicare claims data. HCC scores were compared among physician specialties and further stratified for radiologists based on a range of characteristics. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed.

## Results

Of 549,194 physicians across 54 specialties, the mean HCC risk score was 1.62 ± 0.75. Of the 54 specialties, interventional radiology ranked 4th (2.60 ± 1.29), nuclear medicine ranked 16th (1.87 ± 0.45), and diagnostic radiology ranked 21st (1.75 ± 0.61). Among 31,175 radiologists, risk scores were higher ( _P_ < 0.001) for those with teaching (2.03 ± 0.74) vs nonteaching affiliations (1.72 ± 0.61), practice size ≥100 (1.94 ± 0.70) vs ≤9 (1.59 ± 0.79) members, urban (1.79 ± 0.69) vs rural (1.67 ± 0.59) practices, and subspecialized (1.85 ± 0.81) vs generalized (1.68 ± 0.42) practice patterns. Among noninterventional radiology subspecialties, patient complexity was highest for cardiothoracic (2.09 ± 0.57) and lowest for breast (1.08 ± 0.32) imagers. At multivariable analysis, a teaching affiliation was the strongest independent predictor of patient complexity for both interventional (β = +0.23, _P_ = 0.005) and noninterventional radiologists (β = +0.21, _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusions

Radiologists on average serve more clinically complex Medicare patients than most physicians nationally. However, patient complexity varies considerably among radiologists and is particularly high for those with teaching affiliations and interventional radiologists. With patient complexity increasingly recognized as a central predictor of clinical outcomes and resource utilization, ongoing insights into complexity measures may assist radiologists navigating emerging risk-based payment models.

## Introduction

Currently, most physician payments are determined on a fee-for-service basis and do not consider either the quality of services rendered or the complexity of patients served. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA) , however, payments will become increasingly value based. Most Medicare participating physicians, whether in a community or academic setting, will soon be paid under the Merit-based Incentive Payment Service (MIPS), a modified fee-for-service system in which payments will undergo a positive, neutral, or negative adjustment based on a composite performance score determined from a wide range of metrics and compared against national performance levels .

To ensure the success of MACRA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) seeks to recognize variation in physicians' practices in determining value-based payment adjustments . One important source of such variation is the complexity of physicians' unique patient populations. Physicians caring for sicker patients, as may be anticipated among university and other tertiary care centers, will be challenged in obtaining the same clinical outcomes and resource utilization as those caring for healthier patients. Risk adjustment of performance scores aims to account for such variation , and CMS has accordingly adopted risk adjustment as a prominent recurring theme throughout its implementation of MACRA , focusing particularly on the Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk adjustment methodology widely applied in other CMS programs. In the Quality performance category of MACRA, for example, all outcome measures generally have risk adjustment embedded in the measure calculation. For non-MIPS Quality measures that are submitted through a qualified clinical data registry, the qualified clinical data registry must provide CMS with a plan for risk adjustment of measures, if appropriate . Moreover, all measures in the Cost performance category of MACRA specifically entail risk adjustment, which will be performed by CMS .
