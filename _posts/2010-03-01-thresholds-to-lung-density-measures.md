We congratulate Dr Hoffman and his team for their beautiful and important article published in the June 2009 issue of _Academic Radiology_ . This article highlights an important topic for emphysema measurement. However, in their paper, the authors state, “Based on pathology comparisons…and literature-based consensus…−910 HU \[Hounsfield units\] was specified a priori as the threshold for primary analyses.” A threshold of −910 HU was established by Müller et al , who used one single-slice computed tomographic scan with a slice thickness of 10 mm and intravenous contrast. Slice thickness and the use of intravenous contrast influence lung density and the measurement of emphysema . Recently, Madani et al reported a study using multidetector computed tomography without iodinated contrast. The strongest correlation of multidetector computed tomography with macroscopy was observed at a threshold of −970 HU ( _r_ = 0.543, _P_ < .001), and that with microscopy was observed at −960 and −970 HU. We would like to know Hoffman et al's rationale for choosing a threshold of −910 HU.
