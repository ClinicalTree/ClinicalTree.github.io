## Rationale and Objectives

Chest radiographic findings are important for diagnosis and management of tuberculosis. The reliability of these findings is therefore of interest. We sought to describe interobserver reliability of chest radiographic findings in pulmonary tuberculosis, and to understand how the reliability of these findings might affect the utility of radiographic findings in predicting tuberculosis relapse.

## Materials and Methods

Three blinded readers independently reviewed chest radiographs from a randomly selected group of 10% of HIV-seronegative subjects participating in a tuberculosis treatment trial. The three readers then arrived at a fourth, consensus radiographic interpretation.

## Results

A total of 241 films obtained from 99 patients were reviewed. Agreement among the independent readers was very good for the findings of bilateral disease (κ = 0.71–0.86 among readers) and cavitation (κ = 0.66–0.73). The original interpretation was reasonably sensitive and specific (compared to the consensus interpretation) for bilateral disease, but the sensitivity for cavity decreased from 81% for the 2-month film to 47% at end of treatment ( _P_ = 0.013). Substituting the consensus interpretation for the original interpretation increased the odds ratio for the association between cavitation on early chest radiograph and subsequent tuberculosis relapse from 4.97 to 8.97.

## Conclusion

Radiographic findings were reasonably reliable between independent reviewers and the original interpretations. The original investigators, who knew the patient's clinical course, were less likely to identify cavitation on the end of treatment chest radiograph. Improving the reliability of these findings could improve the utility of chest radiographs for predicting tuberculosis relapse.

Chest radiographic findings have traditionally been important for diagnosis and management of tuberculosis (TB). The current American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for TB treatment recommend extending treatment from 6 to 9 months for patients with both a cavity on early (taken after 2 months or less of treatment) chest radiograph (CXR) and a positive sputum culture after 2 months of antituberculous therapy . This recommendation was based to a large extent on the findings of the Tuberculosis Trials Consortium Study 22. Study 22 was a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that compared a standard twice-weekly TB treatment regimen during the continuation phase of therapy with a once-weekly regimen substituting a new drug, rifapentine, for the standard agent, rifampin. The final study cohort of 1004 subjects was restricted to HIV-seronegative individuals . Five characteristics were found to be independently associated with increased risk for disease relapse: positive sputum cultures for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ after 2 months of antituberculous therapy; the presence of a cavity on a CXR taken during the first 2 months of treatment, being underweight, having bilateral pulmonary involvement, and being a non-Hispanic white person. The risk for TB relapse was 23% in the group with both culture-positive sputum after 2 months of therapy plus a cavity on an early CXR, and less than 2% in the group with neither a cavity on chest film nor positive sputum cultures after 2 months of antituberculous therapy .

There are several reasons why it is important to better understand the reliability of CXR interpretations. First, there are now clinical ramifications for recognizing or missing the presence of a cavity on an early (taken either at initiation of treatment or at 2 months after initiation of treatment) CXR. Second, in response to the findings of Study 22, clinical trials examining new therapeutic options for treatment of TB are basing enrollment strategies and analyses on subjects' radiographic pattern. Unfortunately, several studies have described only moderate agreement among independent observers in evaluating radiographs for manifestations of TB . Furthermore, agreement may vary depending on the observer's specialty and level of experience . When the individual interpreting the chest radiograph is familiar with the patient's clinical condition, the interpretation of the chest radiograph may also be biased by the clinical data. Bias and interreader variability may both affect the utility of radiographic data in predicting TB outcomes. We therefore conducted a substudy to validate the radiographic findings of Study 22 and to assess how interreader reliability and bias might have affected the association between radiographic findings and TB relapse.

Relapse
represents the proportion of subjects with a cavity, as determined by an observer with sensitivity/specificity as noted, who relapse after TB treatment. TrueRelapse
Relapse

True
represents the proportion of subjects who “truly” have a cavity, as determined by a theoretical perfect observer, and relapse after TB treatment. No relapse
No relapse
represents the proportion of subjects with a cavity, as determined by an observer with sensitivity/specificity as noted, who do not relapse after TB treatment. TrueNo relapse
No relapse

True
represents the proportion of subjects who “truly” have a cavity, as determined by a theoretical perfect observer, and do not relapse after TB treatment. Sensitivity was defined as the proportion of radiographs for which a given observer detected a cavity when a cavity was “truly” present. Specificity was defined as the proportion of radiographs for which a given observer did not detect a cavity when a cavity was not “truly” present.

![Figure 1, Predicted increase in the magnitude of the relationship between cavity on early chest radiograph and risk of tuberculosis relapse as the sensitivity and specificity of the radiograph interpretation improve. Each curve demonstrates the predicted relationship between the sensitivity of chest radiograph interpretations (as compared to a theoretical “gold standard” consensus reading) and the odds ratio associating cavity and relapse, with specificity held constant. The odds ratio of 12.42 represents the predicted relationship between cavity on early chest radiograph and relapse given perfect agreement with the gold standard (open square) . The open triangle represents the predicted relationship between cavity on early chest radiograph and relapse given the observed performance characteristics of the original Study 22 radiographic interpretations.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofImprovingtheQualityofRadiographicInterpretationontheAbilitytoPredictPulmonaryTuberculosisRelapse/0_1s20S1076633209005030.jpg)
