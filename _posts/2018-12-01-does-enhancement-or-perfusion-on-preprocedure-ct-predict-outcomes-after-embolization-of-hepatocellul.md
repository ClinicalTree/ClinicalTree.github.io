## Rationale and Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether quantitative enhancement or perfusion measurements on preprocedure triphasic computed tomography (CT) can be used to predict response or overall survival after embolization of hepatocellular carcinoma.

## Materials and Methods

The institutional review board approved this retrospective review of 63 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with particle embolization between March 2009 and December 2014. Quantitative enhancement and perfusion measurements were performed on the target tumor and the background liver on the triphasic CT performed before treatment. Microvascular invasion (MVI) and degree of differentiation were determined from a core biopsy specimen. Quantitative enhancement and perfusion values were then correlated with pathology (two-tailed _t_ test), response to embolization on modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (two-tailed _t_ test), and overall survival after embolization (Cox proportional hazards model).

## Results

Arterial enhancement did not predict immediate response or overall survival after embolization. The degree of differentiation or presence of MVI also did not predict immediate response or overall survival after embolization. However, high hepatic artery coefficient or low portal vein coefficient, both in the tumor ( _P_ = .011 and _P_ = .004) and in the background liver ( _P_ = .015 and _P_ = .009), were associated with worse survival. Hepatic artery coefficient, both in the tumor ( _P_ = .025) and in the background liver ( _P_ = .013), were independent predictors of survival in a multivariate model including the Child-Pugh score and the BCLC stage.

## Conclusions

Tumor and liver perfusion parameters estimated from preprocedure triphasic CT were predictive of survival after embolization. Arterial-phase enhancement and histology (degree of differentiation or MVI) did not predict immediate response or overall survival after particle embolization.

## Introduction

Treatment options for unresectable and unablatable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) using either lipiodol or drug-eluting beads, radioembolization, and sorafenib. Recent randomized trials have shown no difference in overall survival for these treatment options, although there are differences in response rates and quality of life .

Regardless of the treatment, there are a subset of patients who do not respond . Although overall survival after the various different treatment options for unresectable HCC appears to be similar, there might be subgroups that do better with one treatment compared to another . Predicting which patients will have poor outcomes with one treatment option could potentially allow these patients to be directed to a different treatment option.
