## Rationale and Objectives

In flipped learning, medical students independently learn facts and concepts outside the classroom, and then participate in interactive classes to learn to apply these facts. Although there are recent calls for medical education reform using flipped learning, little has been published on its effectiveness. Our study compares the effects of flipped learning to traditional didactic instruction on students' academic achievement, task value, and achievement emotions.

## Materials and Methods

At three institutions, we alternated flipped learning with traditional didactic lectures during radiology clerkships, with 175 medical students completing a pretest on general diagnostic imaging knowledge to assess baseline cohort comparability. Following instruction, posttests and survey examinations of task value and achievement emotions were administered. Linear mixed effects analysis was used to examine the relationship between test scores and instruction type. Survey responses were modeled using ordinal category logistic regression. Instructor surveys were also collected.

## Results

There were no baseline differences in test scores. Mean posttest minus pretest scores were 10.5% higher in the flipped learning group than in the didactic instruction group ( _P_ = 0.013). Assessment of task value and achievement emotions showed greater task value, increased enjoyment, and decreased boredom with flipped learning (all _P_ < 0.01). All instructors preferred the flipped learning condition.

## Conclusions

Flipped learning was associated with increased academic achievement, greater task value, and more positive achievement emotions when compared to traditional didactic instruction. Further investigation of flipped learning methods in radiology education is needed to determine whether flipped learning improves long-term retention of knowledge, academic success, and patient care.

## Introduction

Medical students must master an extraordinarily large knowledge base and associated technical vocabulary in a very short time period. To this end, undergraduate radiology education has been largely dominated by didactic teaching methods designed to expeditiously deliver large volumes of information with a minimum student/instructor interaction . However, traditional large group lectures may not be ideal for the facilitation of development of the types of knowledge discovery and problem-solving skills required in radiology and other types of medical practice .

To address this problem, there is growing interest in exploring complementary medical instructional approaches that would more efficiently fill in existing knowledge gaps, foster application of knowledge stores, promote higher order thinking, and better prepare students for the challenges of clinical decision-making encountered in patient care contexts . Although many medical schools have begun to integrate problem- and team-based learning into their curricula, the transition to these interactive learning methods has been slow, and the use of didactic lectures still predominates . It is difficult to assess the learning outcomes associated with the ongoing slow reform in undergraduate medical education over the past decade, because medical educators have historically adopted varying definitions of what constitutes a problem-based learning curriculum, and not all have adopted the criteria advocated by Barrows, who developed the first problem-based learning curriculum at McMasters University . Moreover, estimates of the efficacy of problem-based learning in medical curricula vary .

![Figure 3, (a) Each student answered one of five levels of agreement or disagreement with each of 19 questions. Survey results revealed a largely consistent pattern of responses within each of the five question types. Answers are shown averaged for both cohorts with responses grouped by categories to demonstrate the polarity of the responses: TV, task value; AE-E, achievement emotions—enjoyment; AE-A, achievement emotions—anxiety; AE-B, achievement emotions—boredom. Each panel of the plot shows an ordered grouping of the questions into the category listed in its left strip label. The frequency distribution of many of the responses is skewed, motivating treatment of the data with ordinal categorical modeling. The number of students answering each question is shown as row count totals. (b) The student survey results are shown here with the didactic and flipped group survey responses in separate columns, showing differences in the response frequency distributions in the two experimental conditions. The survey questions are listed to the left of the response distributions in the order presented.
