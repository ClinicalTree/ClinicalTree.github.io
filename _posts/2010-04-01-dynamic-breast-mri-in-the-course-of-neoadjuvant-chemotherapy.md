## Rationale and Objectives

Basic exploratory data analysis to evaluate enhancement and tumor size (SIZE) in contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) during chemotherapy. Correlation with histopathology (human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2/neu) status and estrogen receptor (ER) score).

## Materials and Methods

Sixty-five women (mean age 47 ± 10 years) with locally advanced breast cancer (mean SIZE 25 mL) had CE-MRI (three-dimensional fast low angle shot (FLASH); repetition time = 9.1 ms, echo time = 4.8 ms, flip angle (FA) 25°, matrix size 256 × 256 pixels, field of view 350 mm, slice thickness 2 mm, number of slices = 32, one precontrast and five postcontrast series) before and after chemotherapy. Lesion segmentation and subsequent SIZE and enhancement analysis including maximum enhancement (MAX), area under the curve (AUC), time-to-peak (TTP), and maximum upslope (MUS) were performed. Correlation with histopathology (ER score and HER2/neu status).

## Results

SIZE reduced significantly during therapy (25 mL vs. 5 mL, _P_ < .0001). AUC, MAX, MUS decreased ( _P_ < .0001), TTP increased ( _P_ < .0001). SIZE and MAX were independent parameters ( _r  2_ = .22). No correlation ( _P_ \> .01) in any of the parameters with either ER score or HER2/neu status was found. HER2/neu score equal 2+pos. or 3+ showed significantly stronger changes in SIZE ( _P_ < .01), MAX ( _P_ < .01) and AUC ( _P_ < .05) compared to lower HER2/neu score (0 to 2+neg.).

## Conclusions

From routine MRI protocol and semiquantitative analysis of signal enhancement curves, information about size, and hemodynamic status of tumors under treatment may be extracted. Reduction in size and maximum enhancement were complementary parameters. In the course of therapy, size and enhancement may develop differently in clinically relevant histopathological subgroups.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become the standard of care for patients with locally advanced breast cancer . Therapy aims to achieve a pathological complete response or tumor reduction and increased rates of breast conserving approaches. Different clinical and pathologic staging parameters and biologic tumor markers have been identified to predict the rate of tumor response in the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Therapy response is frequently described as tumor size reduction in B-mode ultrasound and mammography. There are still controversies in clinical practice on the use of contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) and there is no international reference on breast MRI protocols . Accurate and precise tumor response quantification is critical for monitoring patient therapy and for physician's decision-making on the patient care (ie, therapy decision regime and follow-up). In current clinical practice, tumor size remains the main parameter used to monitor tumor response to therapy . The size criterion is limited however and provides information on only one aspect of therapy response. Enhanced vessel density is an essential premise for tumor growth. Because of increased vessel density and capillary leakage, invasive cancer shows different contrast-enhancement kinetics compared to the adjacent tissue . In the course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the density of tumor vessels may decrease ; therefore, functional parameters are becoming subject of various investigations. Parameters describing tumor perfusion may provide additional information and may allow a better prediction of outcome. Chemotherapeutic treatments are more and more individualized in each patient, and therefore radiological diagnosis can result in therapeutic conclusions of significant importance.

Two distinct approaches have been proposed to measure such hemodynamic parameters with dynamic CE MRI (DCE-MRI) in the breast. High coverage and spatial resolution is essential for lesion detection within glandular parenchyma, and assessment of the lesion's morphology . In addition, the tumor can be characterized to a certain extent by evaluating the shape of the signal-enhancement curve in the lesion . High temporal resolution (∼1 second) might support a more accurate quantification of perfusion and permeability parameters , but coverage is limited to a small number of slices. To combine the benefits of both alternatives, a dual-bolus protocol has been proposed in which the first bolus is monitored at low temporal resolution for localization and curve-type classification, and the second bolus is measured rapidly at the slice position of the detected lesion(s) to allow for more complete and accurate characterization

In a first step (b) , the relative signal enhancement (RSE) is calculated for every pixel and every time point. In a second step (c) , color-coded parameter maps are created of three summary parameters: the maximum RSE ( c , left ), the area under the RSE curve ( c , middle ) and the ratio of both ( c , right ). The maximum image is then taken as a basis for tumor region of interest (ROI) definition (d) . A mask is defined automatically as all pixels with a maximum RSE larger than 50% ( d , left ), the tumor is outlined manually on all slices ( d , middle ) and a final tumor ROI is created as the intersection of the manual outline with the mask ( d , right ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DynamicBreastMRIintheCourseofNeoadjuvantChemotherapy/3_1s20S1076633209006333.jpg)
