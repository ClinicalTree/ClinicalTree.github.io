The following abstracts of diagnostic radiology research and training grants funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were awarded to principal investigators (PIs) whose primary appointments are in medical school departments of radiology. These abstracts are listed on the NIH Web page (  http://www-commons. cit.nih.gov/crisp/ ) and are printed here verbatim.

The grant identification number (eg, 1R01AI12345-01) contains a three-digit activity code (in the previous example, R01) that identifies a specific category of extramural activity. All current NIH activity code titles and definitions can be obtained at the NIH Web page  http://silk.nih.gov/silk/brownbooks/actcod .

IRG (Internal Review Group) refers to the study section that reviewed the application. ICD (Institute, Center, Division) refers to the NIH funding source.

The abstracts of the funded grants are printed alphabetically by author according to the funding institute or center.
