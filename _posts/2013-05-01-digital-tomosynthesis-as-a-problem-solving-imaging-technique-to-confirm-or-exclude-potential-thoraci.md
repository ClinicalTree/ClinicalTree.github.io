## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the capability of digital tomosynthesis (DTS) as a problem-solving imaging technique to confirm or exclude potential thoracic lesions based on chest x-ray radiography (CXR).

## Materials and Methods

Four hundred and-sixty five patients (263 male, 202 female; age, 72.47 ± 11.33 years) with suspected thoracic lesion(s) after the initial onsite analysis of CXR underwent DTS. Two independent readers prospectively analyzed in consensus CXR and DTS images on a picture archiving and communications system–integrated workstation and proposed a diagnosis according to a confidence score for each lesion: 1 or 2 = definite or probable pulmonary or pleural benign lesion or pseudolesion deserving no further diagnostic work-up; 3 = indeterminate; 4 or 5 = probable or definite pulmonary lesion deserving further diagnostic work-up by computed tomography (CT). In patients who did not undergo chest CT, the DTS findings had to be confirmed by 6 to 12 months’ imaging follow-up.

## Results

Finally, 229 pulmonary lesions (193 thoracic and 36 pleural lesions) and 236 pseudolesions were identified. Based on DTS images, readers correctly classified all pseudolesions except for 10/236 (reader 1) or 11/236 (reader 2) pseudolesions and 7 (reader 1) or 6 (reader 2) pulmonary subpleural lesions located in the anterior or posterior lung region close to the thoracic wall. Chest CT was performed in 127/465 (27%) patients, whereas in 338/465 patients (73%) CXR doubtful findings were resolved by DTS.

## Conclusions

DTS allowed to exclude most pseudolesions initially considered as potential thoracic lesions on the preliminary onsite assessment of CXR and allowed to exclude pulmonary lesions deserving CT assessment in about three fourths of the patients.

On chest radiography (CXR) it is not unusual that a radiologist reports doubtful or equivocal findings that could be due to pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesions or even pseudolesions. True pulmonary lesions—particularly pulmonary nodules—can be difficult to differentiate from pseudolesions because of their frequent small size (<1 cm in diameter) and poor conspicuity against surrounding anatomical structures. A pseudolesion could be defined as an opacity not resulting from a true pulmonary or extrapulmonary lesion but to normal anatomical structures including composite areas of increased opacity from overlap of vascular and bone structures of the thoracic wall, vascular kinking, anatomic variant, rib fracture, bone island, or osteophytes. This represents an important clinical problem because up to 20% of suspected pulmonary nodules on CXR could actually represent other lesions.

Even though oblique radiographic views or chest fluoroscopy are still frequently employed to clarify a suspected CXR finding, many patients undergo computed tomography (CT), which frequently characterizes those findings as benign or extrapulmonary lesions or also as pseudolesions. In fact, however, CT is relatively expensive and delivers a considerable radiation dose , but it is not always readily available and scheduling with CT may delay workup of patients in busy CT services.
