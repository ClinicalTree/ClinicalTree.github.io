## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to describe prenatal and postnatal imaging features and outcomes of neonates with neonatal lymphatic disorders (NLDs).

## Materials and Methods

An institutional review board-approved search of the radiology database for patients with NLD identified five patients. Inclusion criteria include prenatal imaging (fetal magnetic resonance \[MR\] imaging and ultrasound) and postnatal three-dimensional T2 Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrasts using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography within 6 months of life. Chart review was undertaken to evaluate morbidity and mortality.

## Results

Prenatal finding of “nutmeg lung” or fetal pulmonary lymphatic disorder was identified in all five patients on fetal MR imaging, and in four of five patients on fetal ultrasound. Postnatal dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography demonstrated abnormal lymphatic flow to the lungs in four of five patients, but absent in the single patient with coexisting hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). Dermal backflow was seen in one patient, also the only patient with prenatal body wall edema. Three patients with lymphatic flow to the lungs only were classified as neonatal chylothorax. The patient with dermal backflow and perfusion to the lungs was diagnosed with central lymphatic flow disorder (CLFD). The HLHS patient with normal lymphatic perfusion maintained the HLHS diagnosis. Of the five patients, the patient with CLFD and the one with HLHS expired because of respiratory distress.

## Conclusions

NLDs can be recognized on prenatal and postnatal imaging and may be primary, as in neonatal chylothorax or CLFD, or secondary. In this small series, “nutmeg lung” was present in all patients. Prenatal imaging demonstrates that body wall edema may correlate with postnatal dermal backflow, which, in our small cohort, carried a poor prognosis.

## Introduction

Neonatal lymphatic disorders (NLD) are a group of rare diseases that clinically manifest as one or a combination of chylous pleural effusion, chylous ascites, and soft tissue edema. Various terms are found in the literature to describe these conditions, including congenital chylothorax , non–immune neonatal hydrops fetalis, congenital lymphatic dysplasia , congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia , and primary lymphatic dysplasia .

These disease processes are difficult to evaluate in part because of the rarity of these conditions and the lack of an effective minimally invasive lymphatic imaging method. Bellini et al. used lymphoscintigraphy to identify the lymphatic flow patterns in patients with NLD and demonstrated several findings, including congenital aplasia or hypoplasia of the peripheral lymphatics, congenital abnormalities of the abdominal or thoracic lymphatic trunks, and congenital lymphatic valvular incompetence . One of the advantages of lymphoscintigraphy is the ability to demonstrate the dynamics of lymphatic flow; however, its spatial resolution is significantly limited. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance lymphangiography (DCMRL) is a new lymphatic imaging technique that allows imaging of the central lymphatic system through the delivery of a gadolinium-based contrast agent into the inguinal lymph nodes under ultrasound (US) guidance . DCMRL provides both dynamic flow and anatomic information. Using this technique, Dori et al. and Itkin et al. visualized abnormal pulmonary lymphatic flow from the thoracic duct toward lung parenchyma in adult and pediatric patients with plastic bronchitis, a finding they named pulmonary lymphatic perfusion syndrome .
