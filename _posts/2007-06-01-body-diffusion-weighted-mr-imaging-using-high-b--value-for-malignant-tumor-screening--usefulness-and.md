## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the potential usefulness of high _b_ -value body diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) as a screening tool in the depiction of abdominal malignant tumors.

## Materials and Methods

We selected 110 abdominal magnetic resonance examinations (1.5 T; 60 men; age range, 25–90 years) with and without malignant tumors ( _n_ = 37 and _n_ = 73, respectively). Axial DWIs were obtained by single-shot spin-echo (SE) type echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence with inversion pulse (repetition time, 6,800 msec; echo time, 100 msec; T1, 150 msec; _b_ value, 1,000 sec/mm  2 ) without breath-holding. Two radiologists independently interpreted the DWIs, T2-weighted images (T2-WI), all three types of images including DWIs, T2-WIs, and fusion images at the same time (DWIs + T2-WIs + fusion) with 7–14 days’ interval, and the diagnostic confidence for each patient was scored.

## Results

The area under the curve (AUC) of the composite receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of DWIs + T2-WIs + fusion (0.904) was significantly higher than those of DWIs (0.720; _P_ < .001) and T2-WIs (0.822; _P_ < .05). Both sensitivity and specificity were higher in DWIs + T2-WIs + fusion (89.5% and 81.9%, respectively) compared with those of DWIs (72.4% and 59.0%; _P_ < .01 and _P_ < .001, respectively).

## Conclusions

Abdominal high _b_ -value DWIs have a high sensitivity and specificity for malignant tumors when T2-WIs are referred and image fusion technique is employed, suggesting that it may potentially be a new screening tool.

Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) technology allow us to obtain diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) with high _b_ -factor not only in the brain but in the body, and the image quality of body DWIs has improved even under a free breathing using a short TI inversion recovery echo planar imaging sequence that allows potent fat suppression ( ).

There have been several reports that showed the high ability of body DWIs to detect various malignant tumors ( ). For instance, Ichikawa et al ( ) reported that the high _b_ -value DWIs allow detection of colorectal adenocarcinoma with a high sensitivity and specificity, and Nasu et al ( ) reported that combined reading of DWIs, and T1- and T2-weighted images had the higher accuracy in the detection of hepatic metastases than did reading of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles (SPIO)-enhanced MR images. These reports let us suggest the potential capability of body DWIs as a screening tool for malignant tumors.

There is a faint high signal at the pancreatic head on DWI, but this signal may be due to normal duodenum (The intestinal content sometimes show faint signal on DWIs). However, T2-WIs shows biliary tract dilatation (not seen on the presented image) and the fusion image clarify that the abnormal signal on DWI is located in the pancreatic head.
