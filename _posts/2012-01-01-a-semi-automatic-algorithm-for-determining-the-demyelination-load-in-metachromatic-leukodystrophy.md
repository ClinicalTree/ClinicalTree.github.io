## Rationale and Objectives

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a lysosomal storage disorder leading to progressive demyelination of brain white matter. This is sensitively detected using magnetic resonance imaging. The volume of demyelination, the “demyelination load,” could serve as a useful parameter for assessing both the natural course of the disease and treatment effects. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a semiautomated approach for determining the demyelination load to achieve reliable and time-efficient segmentation results.

## Materials and Methods

The demyelination load was determined in 77 magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 35 patients both manually and semiautomatically. For manual segmentation, regarded as the gold standard, the software ITK-Snap was used. For semiautomatic segmentation, a new algorithm called Clusterize was developed and implemented in MATLAB, consisting of automatic iterative region growing followed by the interactive selection of clusters. Results were compared in terms of the obtained volumes, spatial overlap, and time taken to conduct the segmentation.

## Results

Performance of the semiautomatic algorithm was excellent, with the volumes generated by the new algorithm showing good agreement with the ones generated by the gold standard (93.4 ± 45.5 vs 96.1 ± 49.0 mL, _P_ = NS) with high spatial overlap (Dice’s similarity coefficient = 0.7861 ± 0.0697). The semiautomatic algorithm was significantly faster than the gold standard (8.2 vs 27.0 min, _P_ < .001). Intrarater and interrater reliability determined high reproducibility of the method.

## Conclusion

The demyelination load in metachromatic leukodystrophy can be determined in a time-efficient manner using a semiautomatic algorithm, showing high agreement with the current gold standard.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare inherited lysosomal storage disorder leading to the degradation of the myelin sheath in both the central and peripheral nervous system . Three forms are distinguished: a late infantile (onset before 3 years of age), a juvenile (16 years), and an adult form. Patients develop progressive neurologic symptoms with different rates of disease progression and different initial manifestations . Currently, no curative treatment is available, though promising new therapeutic approaches are under investigation .

The imaging hallmark of this disease is a rapidly progressive leukodystrophy, which can be detected sensitively using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Demyelinated white matter (WM) presents as hyperintensities on T2-weighted images. Only recently, Eichler et al developed a score for visually assessing these hyperintensities. This score ranges from 0 to 34 points and has been applied to describe the natural course of the disorder in children . Here, a rater scores a number of predefined brain regions as “normal” (healthy), “faint” (1 point), or “dense hyperintensity” (2 points). Although this allows the assessment of global disease progression in a structured way, it would be beneficial to have a more sensitive and quantitative measure of the affected tissue . This is particularly important when evaluating new therapeutic approaches, for which an objective validation of putative treatment-induced changes is of high relevance.

where MAN denotes the voxels segmented manually and SAM the voxels segmented semiautomatically. A DSC of 1 means 100% congruency; no congruency will result in a DSC of 0. There is no common agreement on a minimum value for an acceptable DSC, but coefficients > 0.7 have been considered good or high in previous publications .
