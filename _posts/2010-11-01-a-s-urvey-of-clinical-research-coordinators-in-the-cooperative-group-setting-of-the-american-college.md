## Rationale and Objectives

As one of the newest cooperative groups funded by the National Cancer Institute in 1999, the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) is interested in conducting successful clinical research programs and pursuing quality research. The ACRIN Research Associate (RA) committee was formed in 2000 and felt it important to better understand the demographics, duties, needs, and concerns of ACRIN RAs. Therefore, in 2008, the committee conducted a survey of ACRIN RAs regarding these issues.

## Materials and Methods

The survey instrument consisted of 33 multiple choice questions covering demographics, salary, job satisfaction, work load, educational background, and training. RAs completed the survey electronically in June 2008.

## Results

A total of 110 responses were received. All regions of the United States were represented. The years of experience and salary ranged widely from <1 year to 28 years and ≤$20,000 to ≥$80,000 per year. The majority of respondents held at least a bachelor's degree, with many having previous health-related clinical training; only a small percentage of respondents having had formal training in research.

## Conclusion

Our survey summarizes the demographics and educational background of the research associates within ACRIN. This may help administrators understand the needs and characteristics of RAs participating in cooperative group research. In today's environment with tight regulatory control, it may become necessary to improve educational standards or require certification through one of the professional research organizations.

Cooperative groups (CG) are major sponsors of oncology research in the United States, Canada, and Europe and enroll more than 22,000 patients onto clinical trials yearly . Most university-based research programs include affiliation with at least one cooperative group and in many cases more than one. CGs are primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health using the cooperative agreement funding mechanism (U01 grants). The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) is one of the newest CGs, conceived in 1999, and funded by the National Cancer Institute. To date, ACRIN has opened 30 clinical studies and has enrolled more than 76,550 subjects .

Research Associates (RAs), also known as clinical research coordinators, play a critical role in supporting a successful clinical research program and ensuring the quality of research within the CG setting. RAs' responsibilities include preparing institutional review board submissions, maintaining regulatory documents, screening potential research participants, participating in the informed consent process, scheduling tests and treatments, completing and submitting case report forms, following the participants in accordance with protocol requirements, and ensuring compliance with hospital and federal regulations and Good Clinical Practice.
