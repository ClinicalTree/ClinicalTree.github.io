## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate outcome of magnetic resonance (MR)-detected biopsied breast lesions ≤5 mm by correlating imaging characteristics with pathology.

## Methods and Materials

Institutional review board–approved retrospective review of 565 lesions biopsied with MR guidance between March 2004 and February 2009 found 68 lesions ≤5 mm in 61 patients. Lesions evaluated were those prospectively recommended for biopsy based on clinical setting, suspicious lesion morphology, and kinetics. Two study radiologists, blinded to final pathology, reviewed MR exams recording patient age, exam indication (staging, surveillance, diagnostic, or follow-up), mass location, size, morphology, T2-weighted signal, and kinetics. Chart review provided final pathology.

## Results

Of 68 masses ≤5 mm, 14 (20.6%) were malignant. Of 32 <5 mm, 32 (28.1%) were malignant. Of 14 malignancies, 7 (50%) were in patients with recently diagnosed breast cancer, 6 in the same breast, of which 4 (66.7%) were in same quadrant. Higher likelihood of malignancy based on proximity to known cancer was statistically significant ( _P_ = .01). No significant difference in proportion of malignancies was found based on age, T2-weighted signal, morphology, or kinetics.

## Conclusion

For MR-detected biopsied masses, the positive predictive value for malignancy of those ≤5 mm was 20.6%. The highest prevalence of cancers was in the same quadrant as a newly diagnosed breast cancer. The decision to biopsy small masses should be based on carefully assessed MR features, and in the context of exam indication, not solely on size.

For the breast imaging radiologist interpreting magnetic resonance (MR) exams, assessment of very small enhancing lesions is challenging. Patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer (staging) or at high risk for breast cancer are more likely to have malignant lesions and benefit from the heightened sensitivity of breast MR imaging (MRI) . Specific to the breast, the American College of Radiology (ACR) Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon for breast MRI defines as “focus” any dot of enhancement that is too small for further characterization, generally <5 mm in size. Although in some cases a focus may be a solitary finding, the appearance of multiple foci can be a manifestation of physiologic background parenchymal enhancement. In such cases, distinguishing a small mass (characterizable shape and margins) within this background can be challenging.

A 2001 study found little utility in sampling breast lesions <1 cm because of the high likelihood of inconclusive results. A study in 2006 showed <3% malignancy in masses <5 mm and suggested that such lesions be managed with short interval imaging follow-up. Van den Bosch found 11 malignancies among 30 MR-detected ≤5 mm lesions corresponding to a malignancy rate of 37%. To identify which features might have led to the biopsy recommendation in these small masses, Daniel et al reevaluated 19 of Van den Bosch’s 30 cases, comparing the morphologic and kinetic features to an age-controlled cohort of larger, more easily characterized masses. They found that the morphology and kinetics of small masses can be assessed in a manner similar to larger masses. In 2010 Dietzel et al found in their retrospective review (12 years of data), 88 MR-detected ≤5 mm lesions, 31% of which were malignant.
