## Rationale and Objectives

The objectives of this article are: To explore the impact of the Radiological Society of North America–sponsored “Teach the Teachers” training course and other capacity building interventions (CBIs) on Uganda's ultrasound (US) training capacity; compare performance of students undertaking a modular diploma ultrasound course to the non-modular; and compare performance among various health cadres undertaking US training.

## Materials and Methods

The impact of the “Teach the Teachers” training course and other capacity building interventions were evaluated through analysis of the planning, implementation, sustainability, and output of the training center. Comparison of students' performance in the modular and non-modular diploma courses was by a retrospective cohort methodology using odds ratios. Comparison of performance was by analyzing their mean test scores using a paired Student _t_ -test.

## Results

To date, 306 students from nine African countries have successfully completed the US diploma training. Fifty (16%) are non-Ugandans. The non-modular cohort has performed better than the modular (OR = 3.2) in the final written examination. The mean test scores for the final written examinations were: 73.4%, 71.9%, 61.2%, and 57% for the doctors, radiographers, assistant physicians, and nurses/midwives, respectively.

## Conclusion

The Radiological Society of North America–sponsored “Teach the Teacher's course in US” together with other capacity building interventions have led to an established center of excellence for US training in Uganda.

In 2001, Uganda with a population of 28 million had only 25 radiologists and 60 non-physician sonographers. There were about 150 ultrasound (US) machines countrywide, most operated by untrained or undertrained personnel. Similar shortages of trained US users occurred through Africa . Special US techniques such as small parts, musculoskeletal, Doppler, and interventional US were not routinely applied. There were poor health indices for diseases in which US plays a significant diagnostic role such as maternal mortality .

This poor state of human resource still persists in Africa, and is perceived by the World Health Organization as the largest hindrance to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals . In addition, there is insufficient US training capacity, facilities and resources. Individuals from Africa who wish to undertake formal courses in US have had to travel to Europe or America, which proves too expensive and deters many from training. Some of those who train abroad do not return to Africa, where earnings are lower.
