## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to develop and implement a respiratory-gated setup for dual-source computed tomography (CT) at high pitch to examine patients in a reproducible inspiratory phase.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-one patients underwent free-breathing respiratory-gated chest CT using a high-pitch scan mode no more than 6 months after inspiratory breath-held nongated CT, which serves as reference. Scan parameters were as follows: pitch = 3.4, 128 × 0.6 mm collimation, 0.28 s gantry rotation time, and 150 ref.mAs per tube at 120 kV. The examinations were triggered using the tidal wave provided by a respiratory-gating system as input signal. Image quality was assessed focusing on artifacts and delineation of the anatomical and pathological structures. Lung volumes were measured on both free-breathing and reference examinations.

## Results

All examinations were performed without complications. Image quality was high with both protocols. Significantly less motion artifacts were recorded with the high-pitch mode compared to the reference ( _P_ = 0.02). Most of the artifacts were located in the peripheral parts of the lower lobes for the study group and in the central part of the left lower lobe for the reference. Average total lung volume was 4.5 ± 1.5 L in respiratory-gated examinations and 5.8 ± 0.9 L in examinations with breath-hold in inspiration.

## Conclusions

High-pitch chest CT scanning during free breathing minimizes motion artifacts, improving image quality in patients with limited breath-holding abilities. To assure scanning in an inspiratory phase, data acquisition should be triggered with a respiratory-gating system.

## Introduction

Computed tomography (CT) has an important role to play in thoracic imaging . Isotropic imaging of the chest is possible with modern multislice spiral CT systems in less than 10 s, a breath-hold time that can be managed by the majority of patients. As a consequence of the shorter scan times, respiratory motion artifacts decreased and image quality improved significantly. Shorter CT rotation times also enabled higher temporal resolution and significantly reduced cardiac motion artifacts, which are not only known to alter the image quality near the heart, but also responsible for pulsation artifacts around the aorta and central pulmonary vessels .

However, there is a group of patients that cannot comply with breathing commands, for example ventilated patients, sedated patients, mentally impaired patients, or pediatric patients. Hence, image quality is commonly degraded from motion artifacts in these patient groups.

![Figure 2, Respiratory gating: Respiratory-gating curve ( gray curve ), as measured by the load cell, correlates well with the spirometric tidal volume ( black curve ). Evaluation of the preceding excursions during respiration ( shaded green ) determines the trigger point ( red dot ) needed for an examination ( shaded yellow ) in an inspiratory phase >80% of the tidal range. By this calculation, the table acceleration ( shaded blue ) can be started in advance of the image acquisition. A deep inspiration was performed at t = 20 s in this patient.
