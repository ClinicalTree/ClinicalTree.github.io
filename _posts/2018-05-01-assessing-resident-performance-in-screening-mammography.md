## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to provide objective performance data and feedback, including examination volumes, recall rates, and concordance with faculty interpretations, for residents performing independent interpretation of screening mammography examinations.

## Method and Materials

Residents (r) and faculty (f) interpret screening mammograms separately and identify non-callbacks (NCBs) and callbacks (CBs). Residents review all discordant results. The number of concordant interpretations (fCB-rCB and fNCB-rNCB) and discordant interpretations (fCB-rNCB and fNCB-rCB) are entered into a macro-driven spreadsheet. These macros weigh the data dependent on the perceived clinical impact of the resident's decision. Weighted outcomes are combined with volumes to generate a weighted mammography performance score. Rotation-specific goals are assigned for the weighted score, screening volumes, recall rate relative to faculty, and concordance rates. Residents receive one point for achieving each goal.

## Results

Between July 2013 and May 2017, 18,747 mammography examinations were reviewed by 31 residents, in 71 resident rotations, over 246 resident weeks. Mean resident recall rate was 9.9% and significantly decreased with resident level (R), R2 = 11.3% vs R3 = 9.4%, R4 = 9.2%. Mean resident-faculty discordance rate was 10% and significantly decreased from R2 = 12% to R4 = 9.6%. Weighted performance scores ranged from 1.1 to 2.0 (mean 1.6, standard deviation 0.17), but did not change with rotation experience. Residents had a mean goal achievement score of 2.6 (standard deviation 0.47).

## Conclusions

This method provides residents with easily accessible case-by-case individualized screening outcome data over the longitudinal period of their residency, and provides an objective method of assessing resident screening mammography performance.

## Introduction

Resident training in screening mammography is challenging from both the resident learner and the faculty educator perspectives. Unlike other subspecialties in diagnostic radiology, residents rarely view mammograms outside of their dedicated mammography rotation and thereby tend to have less familiarity with the range of normal mammographic findings and manifestations of pathology. Furthermore, workstation requirements are tightly regulated and expensive , which often limits access to resident review of mammograms. Teaching screening mammography to diagnostic radiology residents poses unique challenges for the faculty. The screening paradigms in academic settings vary, often including some combination of batch interpretations, real-time reading (while patients wait), or interpretation interspersed with diagnostic breast imaging examinations. Most high-volume academic screening practices rely on batch reading. Integrating residents into the batch reading process is particularly challenging for both residents and staff and in order for staff to maintain high levels of accuracy and efficiency, residents may be relegated to a more passive observer role. To maintain concentration, accuracy, and efficiency, staff may be less motivated or capable of providing adequate instruction .

Assessing resident performance in screening mammography also poses challenges. What metric or combination of metrics is most important—examination volumes, interpretative speed, recall rates, overall accuracy, or false-positive and false-negative rates? In light of these challenges, evaluation of resident screening mammography skills tends to be subjective, or at most, include minimal performance measures such as examination volume.

In summary, we present a model for resident education in screening mammography that appears to have great benefits for both resident learners and faculty teacher-clinicians. In a practical sense, the separation of screening interpretation into independent faculty and resident review sessions allows more efficient and less distracted faculty interpretation, and most importantly, for active resident learning. This quantitative system provides real-time feedback of resident screening mammography performance to residents as they progress through mammography rotations, and promotes self-learning and professionalism. It also affords faculty quantitative measures to better evaluate resident screening mammography skills.
