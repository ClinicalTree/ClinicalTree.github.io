## Rationale and Objectives

The US Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS) recommends that Internet-based patient education materials (IPEMs) be written below the sixth-grade reading level to target the average American adult. This study was designed to determine the readability of IPEMs regarding mammography for breast cancer screening.

## Materials and Methods

Three-hundred mammography-related Web sites were reviewed for IPEMs. Forty-two IPEMs that met the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct were assessed for readability level with four readability indices that use existing algorithms based on word and sentence length to quantitatively analyze Internet sources for language intricacy including the following: Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG), and Gunning Frequency of Gobbledygook (Gunning FOG; GFOG). Results were compared to national recommendations, and intergroup analysis was performed.

## Results

No IPEMs (0%) regarding mammography were written at or below the sixth-grade reading level, based on FKGL. The mean readability scores were as follows: FRES, 49.04 ± 10.62; FKGL, 10.71 ± 2.01; SMOG, 13.33 ± 1.67; and Gunning FOG, 14.32 ± 2.18. These scores indicate that the readability of mammography IPEMs is written at a “difficult” level, significantly above the recommended sixth-grade reading level ( _P_ < .05) determined by the USDHHS.

## Conclusions

IPEMs related to mammography are written well above the recommended sixth-grade level and likely reflect other IPEMs in diagnostic radiology.

The availability of Internet resources has allowed >113 million Americans (of various ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and so forth) to access the Internet for health care–related information . A majority of people who access Internet-based education materials (IPEMs) state that they influence medical treatment decision making . Health care professionals must keep the poor rates of health literacy—the “degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand the basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions” —in the United States in mind when authoring the IPEMs. Furthermore, health literacy is a “measure of patients' ability to read, comprehend, and act on medical instructions” . It is a direct prognostic measurement of a patient's health . Unfortunately, the average American adult reads only at a seventh–eighth grade level . Direct consequences of poor health literacy include increase risk of being admitted to the hospital and poorer self health maintenance, both of which lead to poorer patient outcomes and increased cost of health care .

Tackling the epidemic of poor health literacy may be a long and difficult process; however, health care physicians may be able to improve patient comprehension of IPEMs by improving readability—the level of comprehension a person must have to understand written materials . The US Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS), American Medical Association, and the National Institutes of Health recommend that IPEMs be written at or below the sixth-grade level . Readability analyses have been established to evaluate IPEMs available to patients . Readability assessments have been used by the various fields of medicine to calculate readability of IPEMs available to their patient population . Readability assessments have recently been published in the radiology literature . Within radiology, mammography has been established as an effective tool for breast cancer screening. There are guidelines that exist, which provide physicians (and thus their patients) with recommendations for breast cancer screening. Thus, patients are inevitably exposed to mammography and may turn to IPEMs for medical information. In this study, we assess the readability of IPEMs from US hospitals and universities, professional societies, clinical practices, and miscellaneous health care–associated Web sites related to mammography.
