## Radiology research: why is it important?

Many authors have written about why radiology research is important. Dodd et al wrote in 2006 that, “The research mission of academic departments is the lifeblood of the profession. Research is what keeps our specialty new, exciting and relevant.” Levin and Rao wrote in 2007 that, “It is quite clear that physicians in other specialties, despite a lack of training or experience, would like to assume control of the imaging procedures relating to their specialties. One of the principal ways radiologists can counter these attempts at encroachment is to demonstrate their leadership and expertise through innovative, high-quality research.” Despite the realization that research is important for the future survival of radiology as a medical specialty, the harsh economic reality of the present-day health care environment is that the clinician-scientist, especially in a high-income specialty such as radiology, is an endangered species. Petrou et al wrote in 2009 that, “The need for protected research time is especially acute for junior faculty members. These faculty members, despite their relative inexperience, often bear the brunt of the clinical workload and call schedule. Additionally, inefficient time management and lack of experience in balancing clinical and scientific duties are both common problems for early-career investigators.” Petrou et al further pointed out that, “The current structure of the residency and fellowship training system in radiology is not optimally structured for the development of translational researchers…. To maintain and enhance our role in the imaging sciences, we need to build research programs that address changing healthcare needs and questions in a timely and focused manner. Achieving this will require a paradigm-shift in the structure and goals of our residency and fellowship training systems, together with development and investment in the careers of promising young faculty members.”

## Radiology Research Alliance: who are we and what do we do?

There are many organizations in radiology that focus on research in various subspecialties, but there are very few organizations that focus on building camaraderie between radiology researchers at various stages in their career, from medical or graduate student level to vice chairs of research and department chairs. Radiology Research Alliance (RRA) in the Association of University Radiologists (AUR) was formed specifically to build a vibrant community of radiology researchers at all stages of career development. The slogan for RRA is “RRACE for a better future—Radiology Research at the Cutting Edge for a better future.” We want to ensure that the enthusiasm and passion for imaging research that have driven the careers of many pioneers in our field can infect future generations of imaging researchers. To achieve our mission, our specific goals are to:

- A.
Encourage multidisciplinary research.

- B.
Help departments establish and improve radiology and radiology sciences research programs.

- C.
Stimulate innovative research in radiology and radiological sciences by conducting research symposia at the AUR.

- D.
Support members in their professional development.
