In this third edition of _Neuroradiology: The Requisites_ , the authors set out to highlight the essentials of neuroradiology and concentrate on the more common entities. They also set a goal to reduce the humor that was so prevalent in the previous two editions. The authors have accomplished both of these goals. The book now has 619 pages, reduced from 908 in the second edition. The humor and jokes from the previous edition have been largely removed, allowing the reader to concentrate on the task at hand. The tone of this edition is professional and academic.

This book is divided into 18 chapters highlighting the main topics in neuroradiology, including chapters on techniques in neuroradiology, cranial anatomy, neoplasms of the brain, vascular diseases of the brain, head trauma, infectious and noninfectious inflammatory disease of the brain, approach and pitfalls in neuroimaging, and many others. There are numerous tables, boxes, and figures in each chapter. The tables contain summary information and comparison data drawn from the text, whereas the boxes are lists of differential diagnoses and pertinent findings. These are particularly helpful when looking back to review previously read pages. The figures have multiple labeled images with arrows, which is important as some of the findings are subtle. In addition, the captions to those images are descriptive and well written. The text provides in depth explanations of the more common entities that all have corresponding images and includes the pertinent information of many less common diagnoses. Images of many of the less common entities are also included.

The authors have completed the daunting task of creating a comprehensive neuroradiology text that can be read at multiple levels of training. The junior resident will find that the more common diagnoses, anatomy and basic approach to reading a computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are thoroughly explained. The senior resident and fellow will discover high-level detail in each chapter to satisfy their needs. The neoplasm and infectious disease chapters are particularly well written. In addition, the vascular pathology chapter is very complete and will prepare any resident or fellow for management of those tough call cases. This book is a manageable size that can be read in a 1-month rotation with some effort.

The authors achieve a reasonable balance between the amount of images and text, with almost every page having an image. Throughout the book, the reader will feel that the authors are not simply presenting information, but teaching it. This is a book that will be enjoyed by all residents, fellows, and radiologists.
