## Rationale and Objectives

In vivo tracking cells using gadolinium-based contrast agents have the important advantage of providing a positive contrast on T1-weighted images, which is less likely to be confused with artifacts because of postoperative local signal voids such as metal, hemorrhage, or air. The aim of this study is to paramagnetically and fluorescently label marrow with dual agents (gadolinium-diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid \[Gd-DTPA\] and PEI-FluoR) and track them after transplantation into spinal cord injury (SCI) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

Marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated with PEI-FluoR (rhodamine-conjugated PEI-FluoR) and Gd-DTPA complex for labeling. After labeling, cellular viability, proliferation, and apoptosis were evaluated. T1 value and longevity of intracellular Gd-DTPA retention were measured on a 1.5 T MRI scanner. Thirty-six SCI rats were implanted with labeled and unlabeled MSCs and phosphate-buffered saline. Then, serial MRI and Basso-Beattie-Bresnehan (BBB) locomotor tests were performed and correlated with fluorescent microscopy. The relative signal intensity (RSL) of the engraftment in relation to normal cord was measured and the linear mixed model followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to identify significant differences in RSL as well as BBB score.

## Results

MSCs could be paramagnetically and fluorescently labeled by the dual agents. The labeling did not influence the cellular viability, proliferation, and apoptosis. The longevity of Gd-DTPA retention in labeled MSCs was up to 21 days. The distribution and migration of labeled MSCs in SCI lesions could be tracked until 7 days after implantation on MRI. The relative signal intensities of SCI rats treated with labeled cells at 1 day and 3 days (1.34 ± 0.02, 1.27 ± 0.03) were significantly higher than rats treated with unlabeled cells (0.94 ± 0.01, 0.99 ± 0.02) and phosphate-buffered saline (0.91 ± 0.01, 0.95 ± 0.01) ( _P_ < .05). Rats treated with labeled MSCs or unlabeled MSCs achieved significantly higher BBB scores than controls at 14, 21, 28, and 35 days after injury ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

Labeling MSCs with the dual agents may enable cellular MRI and tracking in experimental spinal cord injury.

Traumatic injuries to the spinal cord lead to severe and permanent neurological deficits. Stem cell transplantation strategies hold promise to enhance functional recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI). Transplanted stem cells can either differentiate into neural cells and replace lost populations of cells or they can produce cytokines or growth factors that can lead to neural cell rescue or enhance regeneration . Previously, embryonic stem cells, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells have been used in cell therapy in animal models of SCI . There has no consensus yet on what kind of stem cells is an ideal source for cellular grafts. However, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are preferred because of their advantages over other sources of cells (ie, relatively easy isolation, use in autologous transplantation protocols, a source of cells already approved for the treatment of hematopoietic diseases) .

For successful cellular transplantation treatment, a reliable method for in vivo evaluation of global cell distribution and cell dynamics is highly desirable. Unlike the current use of stem cells in animal models, the introduction of therapeutic cells in patients will require techniques that can monitor the tissue biodistribution of these cells noninvasively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a well-suited tool to track stem cell persistence and migration over time after cell labeling with MRI-visible contrast agents. Cellular MRI-based cellular imaging allows in vivo visualization of the fate and the migration of cells after transplantation .
