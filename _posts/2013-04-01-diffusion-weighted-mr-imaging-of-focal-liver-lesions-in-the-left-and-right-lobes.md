## Rationale and Objectives

To determine possible differences between the left and right hepatic lobes in apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of benign and malignant focal liver lesions (FLLs) and normal liver parenchyma.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-six patients (16 males, 20 females; mean age 56.8 years) with FLLs of the same etiology in both the left and right hepatic lobes (13 patients with 26 benign FLLs and 23 patients with 46 malignant FLLs) who underwent 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted MRI (b values: 0 and 800 seconds/mm) with respiratory gating and without cardiac gating were included in this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant and institutional review board–approved study. ADC values of normal liver parenchyma and FLLs in each hepatic lobe were calculated and compared by using Student's _t_ -test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively.

## Results

The mean ADC values of normal liver parenchyma, benign FLLs, and malignant FLLs were significantly higher ( _P_ < .001, _P_ = .003, and _P_ = .005, respectively) in the left hepatic lobe (1.74 × 10  −3 , 1.81 × 10  −3 , and 1.48 × 10  −3 mm²/second, respectively) than in the right hepatic lobe (1.48 × 10  −3 , 1.54 × 10  −3 , and 1.24 × 10  −3 mm²/second, respectively).

## Conclusion

ADC values of benign and malignant FLLs calculated from noncardiac-gated DW-MRI are significantly higher in the left hepatic lobe compared with the right hepatic lobe. This may be a limitation for characterization of FLLs based on ADC measurements.

Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is used increasingly for the detection and characterization of focal liver lesions (FLLs). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value provides quantitative characterization of these lesions and is thought to help the differentiation between benign and malignant FLLs. In general, benign FLLs have higher ADC values than malignant FLLs, but there are also variable degrees of overlap between them . Several cutoff ADC values (1.4–1.6 × 10  −3 mm²/second) have been suggested in the literature for differentiating malignant from benign FLLs, with reported sensitivity of 74% to 100% and specificity of 77% to 100% .

Despite widespread clinical use of such advanced MRI techniques as ultrafast and single-shot or multishot echoplanar imaging, multichannel coil, and parallel imaging , however, DW-MRI in the abdomen is still known to be highly sensitive to motion. Several studies have documented that cardiac motion has an impact on DW-MRI of the abdomen, resulting in higher ADC values of normal liver parenchyma in the left hepatic lobe compared with the right hepatic lobe . Therefore, the ADC values of FLLs in the left hepatic lobe may be expected also to be higher than those in the right hepatic lobe. Variations in ADC values of FLLs because of their location in the liver may thus represent an important limitation of DW-MRI and potentially impact the usefulness of DW-MRI for characterizing FLLs. The purpose of this study was to determine whether ADC values of benign and malignant FLLs, calculated from noncardiac-gated DW-MRI, are different in the left and right hepatic lobes.
