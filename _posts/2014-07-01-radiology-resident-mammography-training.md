## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to better understand the concept of mammography difficulty and how it affects radiology resident performance.

## Materials and Methods

Seven radiology residents and three expert breast imagers reviewed 100 mammograms, consisting of bilateral medial lateral oblique and craniocaudal views, using a research workstation. The cases consisted of normal, benign, and malignant findings. Participants identified abnormalities and scored the difficulty and malignant potential for each case. Resident performance (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve \[AUC\]) was calculated for self- and expert-assessed high and low difficulties.

## Results

For cases classified by self-assessed difficulty, the resident AUCs were 0.667 for high difficulty and 0.771 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ = .010). Resident sensitivities were 0.707 for high and 0.614 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ = .113). Resident specificities were 0.583 for high and 0.905 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ < .001). For cases classified by expert-assessed difficulty, the resident AUCs were 0.583 for high and 0.783 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ = .001). Resident sensitivities were 0.558 for high and 0.796 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ < .001). Resident specificities were 0.714 for high and 0.740 for low difficulty cases ( _P_ = .807).

## Conclusions

Increased self- and expert-assessed difficulty is associated with a decrease in resident performance in mammography. However, while this lower performance is due to a decrease in specificity for self-assessed difficulty, it is due to a decrease in sensitivity for expert-assessed difficulty. These trends suggest that educators should provide a mix of self- and expert-assessed difficult cases in educational materials to maximize the effect of training on resident performance and confidence.

The ability to accurately interpret mammograms is a critical skill to develop for radiology residents during training and one clearly emphasized by the American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging education guidelines . Despite these stated goals, survey data from the past 10 years demonstrate that although residents are spending more dedicated time on breast imaging rotations, they are not developing sufficient confidence in their abilities and feel that only radiologists with fellowship training should routinely interpret mammograms . Reinforcing the sense of inadequacy, performance data of new radiology residency graduates demonstrate that those without subspecialty training in breast imaging learn at a high rate during their first few years of practice . However, their learning rate quickly decreases and non–fellowship-trained radiologists take close to 20 years before their recall rates, false-positive rates, sensitivity targets, and the positive predictive value of their recall rates reach the approved levels. In contrast, fellowship-trained radiologists show minimal changes over time as they meet expectations for recall rates, false-positive rates, and the positive predictive value of their recall rates within the first year and sensitivity targets within 3 years . These data imply that performance is more than just years of practice and speak to the importance of concentrated education. Because residents are expected to be both confident and competent in the interpretation of mammograms on graduation from a general diagnostic residency program, there is a strong need for improved residency training in the interpretation of mammograms.

Radiology residents have reported that they find that interpreting mammograms is more stressful than interpreting other imaging studies because of fears of missing potentially important findings, misinterpreting the clinical significance of findings, and the risk of malpractice . This lack of comfort indicates that a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges facing radiology residents is needed. Prior work by multiple investigators has demonstrated several trends. Specifically, residents with less experience struggle to discriminate between benign and malignant abnormalities, resulting in a greater percentage of false-positive results . Residents are also less efficient in their visual search patterns as they cover more image area and struggle to differentiate true breast masses from artifacts and normal breast parenchyma . This results in a delay in detection time and an overall increase in the time spent per mammogram . Despite the longer interpretation time, residents quickly reach a time threshold beyond which they make few meaningful additional discoveries but instead make more errors .
