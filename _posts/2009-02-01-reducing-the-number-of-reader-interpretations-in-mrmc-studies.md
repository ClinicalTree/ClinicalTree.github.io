## Rationale and Objectives

Multireader, multicase (MRMC) receiver-operating characteristic studies often require large numbers of patients, readers, and reader interpretations. The objective of this work is to evaluate a new “mixed” MRMC study design that reduces the number of reader interpretations.

## Materials and Methods

As compared to the traditional MRMC design, the number of reader interpretations and the number of cases that must be truth-verified for the new mixed design was evaluated theoretically and empirically for various correlation values and sample sizes.

## Results

For large MRMC studies, the new mixed design offers a substantial savings in the number of reader interpretations if the magnitude of the difference in between-reader correlations is not zero. For example, compared to a traditional design with 20 readers, 200 total cases, and a difference in between-reader correlations of 0.05, the newly proposed mixed design requires each reader to interpret only 132 cases, but at a cost of truth-verifying an additional 64 cases.

## Conclusions

The mixed design can reduce the number of cases that readers need to interpret and the overall duration of a study, but at a cost in terms of the number of cases that must be truth-verified. The mixed design is particularly useful for studies where the condition being detected is not rare and patients routinely undergo the gold standard assessment.

Multireader, multicase (MRMC) receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) studies are commonly used to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests. For example, the MRMC design is often used in retrospective studies to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy efficacy of computer-aided detection (CAD) devices for breast, lung, and colon cancer by comparing readers' ROC areas without the aid of CAD versus their ROC areas with the aid of CAD ( ).

Because the improvement in accuracy with CAD devices is often small, MRMC ROC studies often require a large sample of patients (usually 100–300) and a moderate-to-large sample of readers (10–20). In a typical CAD study of this size, there would be 2,000–12,000 total reader interpretations. Ways to reduce the total number of reader interpretations and the number of interpretations per reader would reduce both the overall costs of the study as well as its duration. In this work, a new MRMC study design is described, referred to as the mixed design, which reduces the total number of reader interpretations at a cost of additional cases that must be truth-verified.

and prob(F  1,df2,λ \> F  1 − α,1,df2 ) is the probability that a random variable having a noncentral F distribution with 1 and df  2 degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter λ exceeds the (1 − α)100th percentile of a central F distribution, with 1 and df  2 degrees of freedom. J is the total number of readers in the study and μ  i , here, is the conjectured average of readers' area under the ROC curve for the ith diagnostic test (note that other measures of accuracy, such as the partial area under the ROC curve, can also be used). σ  b 2 is the between-reader variability and r  b is the correlation between accuracies when the same readers evaluate patients using different tests. Note that r  b describes the correlation between the different tests because of the paired-reader design. Even in an unpaired-patient design, readers with high accuracy will tend to do well on both tests, and readers with low accuracy will tend to perform poorly on both tests; r  b measures this tendency. σ  w 2 is the within-reader variability and σ  c 2 is the variability resulting from different patient samples. σ  c 2 will tend to be high for samples of difficult-to-diagnose patients and tend to be smaller for samples of easy-to-diagnose patients. For sample size estimation, σ  c 2 can be estimated as a function of the conjectured magnitude of diagnostic accuracy, μ  i , and the patient sample size ( ). r  1 , r  2 , and r  3 are correlations between estimated diagnostic accuracies from the same sample of patients being interpreted by the readers. They describe the correlations between different pairs of readers and diagnostic tests. r  1 is the correlation between the estimated diagnostic accuracies of the same reader, but with different diagnostic tests; r  2 is the correlation between the estimated diagnostic accuracies of different readers using the same test; and r  3 is the correlation between estimated diagnostic accuracies of different readers using different tests. Note that these correlations are zero when the pairs of diagnostic accuracies are estimated from different samples of patients.

where a = \[Φ  −1 (AUC)\](1.414), AUC is the conjectured area under the ROC curve, and Φ  −1 is the inverse of the cumulative normal distribution (4). σ  c 2 increases in the mixed design because there are fewer patients interpreted by each reader. If M  T and M  M are denoted as the number of study patients with the condition interpreted by each reader in the traditional and mixed designs, respectively, then in the mixed design, σ  c 2 increases by M  T /M  M over that in the traditional design (M  T \> M  M ).

Mixed design (two datasets) refers to a design in which half of the readers interpret one sample of cases and the remaining readers interpret a second sample of cases. Mixed design (three datasets) refers to a design in which one third of the readers interpret one sample of cases, one third interprets a second sample of cases, and the remaining readers interpret a third sample of cases.
