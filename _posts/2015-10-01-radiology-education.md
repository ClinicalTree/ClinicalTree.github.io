We are very pleased to present the third dedicated issue of _Academic Radiology_ focused on educational research and scholarship. We would like to graciously thank Dr Stanley Baum, Academic Radiology's Editor-in-Chief and the leadership of the Executive Committees of the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology (AMSER) and Alliance of Clinical Educators in Radiology (ACER) for their support and continued encouragement. This issue's content reflects the changing landscape of radiology education in medical school and the postgraduate years where educators continue to juggle decreasing time and resources with new teaching challenges that require novel solutions. In this issue, we are pleased to present many articles describing innovative methods of teaching and assessment applicable to medical students, residents, and practicing radiologists which are readily adaptable to a varied teaching environment. The themes covered in this issue align with the joint AMSER and ACER missions to promote development and dissemination of resources for medical education and to develop and nurture medical student and clinician educators in the field of radiology .

Although the field of radiology crosses all medical disciplines, it is surprising that integration of imaging into the medical student curriculum remains a challenge at many institutions and that only a minority have radiologists teach in the preclinical years . Given that most medical students will enter specialties other than radiology, a recent study by Webb et al. suggests that the focus should be on appropriate utilization of imaging at both the medical school and postgraduate levels rather than creating “mini radiologists” . As health care systems and the delivery of care become more complex, it has become imperative to have functional interdisciplinary and interprofessional teams to optimize patient outcomes. As educators, we have been tasked with teaching these skills to our trainees. In addition, however, we must work closely with our referring physicians by educating them about how to use imaging effectively as they care for patients. In this issue, Naeger et al. share their experiences of promoting interprofessional teamwork with radiologists among medical students.

Radiology residents and medical students who are starting to learn about diagnostic imaging must see numerous cases to learn what is normal, a normal variant, and true pathology with its varied presentations. In this issue, the process by which to present these different options to new learners of chest radiography has been assessed by Kok et al. who suggest an order in which to present cases to novice imaging learners by starting with a comparison of the disease to a normal case, followed by comparing a disease to a different disease, and finally comparing different manifestations of the same disease. Also, in this issue, Tureli et al. have looked at resident learning curves for learning musculoskeletal anatomy after a brief introductory period, followed by self-directed learning (supported self-directed learning) and found this method to be very effective and potentially applicable to other modalities and subspecialties. For the more advanced radiology resident, it is essential (and a regulatory requirement) for them to have interpreted sufficient cases in each of the 11 radiologic subspecialties. Collecting data on their case logs can be cumbersome, and Chen et al. propose and describe a freely available, Web-based, mobile friendly, automated case log tool that can be readily implemented into any training program.

Given the growing culture focused on patient safety, the days of “see one, do one, teach one” are long gone. Situated learning in a real-life environment is desirable as this approach has been shown to lead to more effective retention and application of learned information. Simulation represents one viable option that can be used to teach and for trainees to learn various skills in a nonintimidating setting without compromising patient safety. Simulation can be particularly applied to instruct and teach procedural and interpretative skills as well as noninterpretative elements such as teamwork, crisis management, communication, and professionalism. In this issue, Chetlen et al. provide a comprehensive review of the current applications and challenges of simulation technology as it specifically pertains to radiology.

Experiential learning is critical for future radiologists to be deemed competent practitioners. Simulated contrast reaction training has been shown to be more effective than a didactic presentation . Investigators have also suggested that biannual refresher training in management of contrast reactions is crucial to maintain trainee knowledge and confidence . Picard et al. have taken this further to assess how best to refresh to retain this knowledge, with the surprising results that a didactic intervention at this time point is as effective as simulation. This is reassuring and good news to those of us who are trying to educate within the constraints of limited resources.

Teaching noninterpretative skills, especially professionalism, can be a challenge for educators as well because it is difficult to define given the many different definitions based on duties, roles, and attributes . Outlining and standardizing a curriculum to teach professionalism is virtually impossible as each trainee's and faculty's professional experience and journey is unique. Both of these limit the ability to accurately or consistently assess this critical attribute. In addition, it is difficult to truly understand what attitudes or intentions underlie the actions that we witness . Teaching methods used to teach professionalism include didactic sessions, reading lists, role modeling, and cases and/or vignettes. In this issue, Kung et al. share their experience of using reflective practice sessions to teach aspects of professionalism, based on scenarios and using a validated questionnaire, the Penn State College of Medicine Professionalism Questionnaire, the curriculum of which is readily available on the Association of University Radiologists Web site .
