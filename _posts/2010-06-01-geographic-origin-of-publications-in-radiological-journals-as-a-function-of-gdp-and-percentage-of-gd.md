## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to examine the geographic origin of publications in the highest impacting radiology journals and to examine the link between the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on research by a country and the output of radiology publications.

## Materials and Methods

The five highest impacting general radiology journals (according to the ISI Web of Knowledge database) were selected over a 6-year period from January 2002 to December 2007. Publications were totaled according to the country of the corresponding author. Publications (total and corrected for population size) were assessed according to the GDP of a given country and the percentage of GDP spent on research in that country. Correlation was determined using Spearman's rank.

## Results

In total, 10,925 papers were identified. The top 10 nations produced 83.9% of the total number of papers. The United States was the most prolific country, with 41.7% of the total. The second-ranked and third-ranked countries were Germany (11.6%) and Japan (6.7%). Corrected for GDP, smaller European countries outperformed larger nations. Switzerland (0.925 publications per billion of GDP), Austria (0.694 publications per billion of GDP), and Belgium (0.648 publications per billion of GDP) produced the most papers per billion of GDP. When corrected for percentage of GDP spent on research, European countries again ranked highest, with Greece, Turkey, and Belgium having the best ratios. The percentage of GDP spent on research was positively correlated with the number of publications in high-ranking radiology journals ( _r_ = 0.603, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

The United States is the most productive country in absolute number of publications. The flaws of using population size to compare publication output are clear, and a comparison using GDP and the percentage of GDP spent on research may give more meaningful results. When GDP is taken into consideration, smaller European countries are more productive. The importance of investment in radiologic research is emphasized by the association between increased funding of research and the number of publications in high-impacting radiology journals.

Funding for medical research comes from both governmental and private sector sources. Publications in high-impacting, peer-reviewed journals are one of the main determinants of research rating and funding. As a result of the global economic recession, the relationships between researchers and their funding sources are likely to become more uncertain. There is some evidence that larger economies are attempting to address the issue of research and development as a means of promoting long-term economic growth; for example, the US government awarded $21 billion in stimulus funding to research . More so than ever, it is likely that value for money will be expected. In this setting, data demonstrating the efficiency of research production will be important.

In this study, we examined the link between the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on research and the output of radiology papers in high-impacting journals. The most accepted way of determining the quality of a journal is through its impact factor. We selected the five highest ranked general radiology journals as determined by impact factor and summed the total number of publications per country (as determined by address of the corresponding author). The correlation between the output of radiology research and the percentage of GDP spent on research by a country was examined. The publication rate of countries in terms of total publications and publication corrected for both population size and GDP were also assessed.
