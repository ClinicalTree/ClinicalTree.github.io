## Rationale and Objectives

Although the number of women graduating from medical school continues to increase, their representation in radiology residency programs has not increased over the past 10 years. We examined whether the gender of radiology faculty and residents differed according to the gender of the departmental leadership.

## Materials and Methods

We issued an anonymous Web-based survey via e-mail to all 188 radiology residency program directors listed in the Fellowship and Residency Electronic Interactive Database (FREIDA Online). Data regarding the gender of the department chairperson, residency program director, faculty, and residents were collected. The institutional review board granted a waiver for this study, and all subjects provided informed consent.

## Results

Of the 84 program directors who responded, 9 (10.7%) were chaired by females and 75 (89.3%) by males; residency program director positions were held by 36 (42.9%) females and 48 (57.1%) males. More programs were located in the northeastern United States (n = 31, 36.9%) than in any other region, and more were self-described as academic (n = 36, 42.9%) than any other practice type. Programs that were led by a male chairperson had a similar proportion of female faculty (25.2% versus 27.3%; _P_ = .322) and residents (26.2% versus 27.4%; _P_ = .065) compared with those led by a female. Similarly, radiology departments with a male residency program director had a similar proportion of female residents (24.8% versus 28.7%; _P_ = .055) compared with programs with a female residency program director.

## Conclusion

The gender composition of radiology faculty and residents does not differ significantly according to the gender of the departmental chairperson or residency program director. Nevertheless, there continues to be a disparity in the representation of women among radiology faculty and residents.

The number of women in medicine and, in particular, academic medicine ( ) has been steadily increasing over the past several decades ( ). This has been particularly true in the field of radiology. Deitch et al. ( ) reported a significant rise in the proportion of female graduates in radiology: 27% of graduates between 1990 and 1995 were women compared with 7% before 1970. More recently, however, results from a 2003 American College of Radiology survey indicated that only 24% of radiology trainees and 18% of practicing radiologists were women ( ). Despite increases in the representation of women until the mid-1990s, the proportion of female residents and faculty, especially in tenured and chairperson positions ( ), continues to lag behind that of men.

Several studies have demonstrated that, compared with male colleagues, women in medicine receive lower salaries ( ), are promoted less rapidly ( ), and less frequently hold the rank of full professor in their departments ( ). It is possible that the proportion of women in medicine is influenced, in part, by the gender composition of the departmental leadership. In 2006, only 10% of academic departments across all medical specialties were led by women ( ). In a recent study of academic emergency medicine departments, it was demonstrated that a department led by a female chairperson was more likely to have a female residency program director (RPD) and a greater proportion of female faculty ( ), suggesting that gender of departmental leadership has a significant effect on the gender of faculty and young trainees. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the gender of radiology department chairperson and/or RPD is associated with the gender composition of faculty and housestaff.
