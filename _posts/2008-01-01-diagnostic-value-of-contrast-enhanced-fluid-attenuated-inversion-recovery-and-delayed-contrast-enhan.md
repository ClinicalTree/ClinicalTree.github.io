## Rationale and Objectives

In brain MRI of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, enhancement of the lesions is usually evaluated in early contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI). The objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity of contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery (CE-FLAIR) and delayed contrast-enhanced MRI in evaluation of MS brain lesions.

## Materials and Methods

Brain MRI examination including early and delayed CE-T1WI and early and delayed CE-FLAIR images was performed for 46 patients with clinically definite MS disease. Number, size, location, degree, and pattern of enhancement of the enhanced lesions in each sequence were recorded separately.

## Results

A total number of 87 enhanced lesions was detected in 30 patients. Early CE-T1WI could detect only 63 lesions (72.4% of total) in 24 patients, while delayed CE-T1WI and early and delayed CE-FLAIR images showed 85 (97.7%), 84 (96.6%), and 81 (93.1%) lesions in 28, 28, and 26 patients, respectively. A greater degree of enhancement and larger lesion size were observed in the additional sequences compared with the early CE-T1WI.

## Conclusions

The sensitivity of early CE-T1WI for the detection of enhanced MS lesions is significantly lower than that for other additional sequences. Delayed CE-FLAIR images could not add significant information to other sequences. Therefore, early CE-FLAIR and delayed CE-T1WI brain MRI can be considered as part of the evaluation of MS patients, especially if, despite clinically suspected active disease, no enhanced lesion is found in the routine CE-T1WI.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common diseases of the central nervous system and the most common disabling neurologic disease of young adults ( ). The diagnostic criteria of MS are clinical: two episodes of aggravating symptoms and evidence of temporal and spatial dissemination. However, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests and MRI have expanding roles in the early diagnosis of MS ( ).

Contrast-enhanced brain MRI is a part of baseline evaluation of suspected and clinically definite MS patients who have shown brain lesions in precontrast MR studies. Contrast-enhanced MRI is regarded as the best indicator of disease activity and response to therapy, being used during the treatment course and follow-up of MS patients ( ). As active MS lesions are associated with focal disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) due to perivascular inflammation, injection of contrast leads to significant shortening of T1-relaxation time of these lesions with subsequent increased signal intensity. Thus, evaluation of enhancement of acute lesions is usually made in early contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE-T1WI) ( ). Some researchers believe that obtaining delayed T1-weighted images (20 minutes to 1 hour after contrast administration) in MS patients will add valuable information to early CE-T1WI ( ), although diagnostic value of delayed imaging has been refuted by some others ( ).
