Thieme's entry on cardiac imaging in the _Dx-Direct_ series is very impressive. Many factors (positive, of course) identified while reviewing this book prompted me to remark to myself that there would be many reasons to have this book in a radiology collection. That is really something, I think, because these reasons have a cumulative effect as well.

The book is extremely portable and could fit in a lab coat pocket or bag quite easily. Its sections are very well organized and seem to represent an optimal mix of depth, breadth, and efficiency. The organization of the individual sections is also optimized (at least to me), with a combination of technical and clinical information that is well decorated (supplanted, if you will) with figures that include a wide variety of radiographic images, including three-dimensional renditions. Some of the illustrations are in color, and there are many helpful illustrations.

One of the things that impressed me most was how easily the sections “read”; it is deceptively difficult, I think, to create a highly efficient text (usually in “bullet format”) that is easy to read. Moreover, I surmise that this text would be useful to radiologists at all levels of training and practice (presuming that they either perform cardiac imaging or would like to do so). There are also some fantastic graphs in the book, many of which can be found in the appendices. One subtle but (potentially) quite useful addition to this book is the detailed section listing abbreviations; in these days of acronym after acronym, it is nice to have a section like this.

In terms of criticisms, I found that some of the images appeared “dated,” and I suggest that they be updated. Maybe it is also that some of the images were so good that it was surprising (shocking in some cases, at least to me) that by internal comparison, others were not as outstanding. Otherwise, I very much enjoyed this book.
