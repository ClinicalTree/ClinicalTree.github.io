## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to optimize photon energy setting to reduce metal artifact of computed tomography (CT) images from implanted metal orthopedic devices in patients with fractures with monoenergetic imaging of dual-energy CT.

## Materials and Methods

This study included 47 patients with factures who underwent metal orthopedic device implanting. After dual-energy CT scan, monoenergetic software was used to postprocess with the following six photon energies: 40 kiloelectron-voltage (keV), 70 keV, 100 keV, 130 keV, 160 keV, and 190 keV. Two radiologists evaluated and rated the reformatted images with six different photon energies and average weighted 120 kVp images according to 4-score scale. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare image quality scores for total, internal, and external metal orthopedic devices. Interreader agreement for image quality scoring was calculated.

## Results

Monoenergetic imaging of dual-energy CT improved the quality of CT images in the fracture patients with metal orthopedic devices compared to the average weighted 120 kVp images for the total, external, and internal metal orthopedic devices (all _P_ values < .01). Optimal keV setting with the lowest metal artifact was 130 keV for total, internal, and external metal orthopedic devices. Good interreader agreement was found for the evaluation of image quality for total, internal, and external metal orthopedic devices.

## Conclusions

Monoenergetic imaging of dual-energy CT improves quality of CT images in patients with metal orthopedic devices after fracture. Reformatted images at 130 keV have the optimal quality for total, internal, and external metal orthopedic devices.

Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with short scan times and isotropic spatial resolution has been widely used in the preoperative and postoperative evaluation of bony lesions; however, the quality of CT images can still be markedly deteriorated by the presence of metal objects in the field of view. Metal artifacts, mostly from quantum noise, scattered radiation, and beam hardening , influence image quality by reducing contrast and by obscuring details, thus impairing the detectability of structures of interest; in the worst case, this can make a diagnosis impossible . It is, therefore, of great importance to reduce these deteriorating artifacts to a minimum for better diagnosis.

Many authors have recommended using higher milliampere second and peak kilovoltage techniques, the smallest collimator size, soft-tissue reconstruction filters, or extended CT Hounsfield unit scale to decrease CT artifacts arising from metal implants; however, these methods can deliver the patients higher radiation dose or decreased spatial resolution or even unavailable . Although many methods for metal artifact reduction in the raw data have been proposed, most algorithms did not provide sufficient quality to be accepted for clinical application . Methods for metal artifact reduction based on postreconstruction data have rarely been investigated . A dual-energy CT (DECT) technique, one image postprocessing method after image reconstruction , was used to reduce the beam-hardening artifact in CT in the 1980s . However, the dual-energy CT technique has not been used widely for clinical indications because of lower spatial resolution, unstable CT numbers, and insufficient tube currents at low tube voltages of the early CT scanners . Recently developed dual-source CT scanners with two orthogonally mounted detectors and tubes arrays operating simultaneously at different tube potentials (80 kVp and 140 kVp) allow for DECT acquisitions with minimal patient motion registration artifacts and were used to improve the detection of pulmonary embolism and cardiovascular diseases , and to characterize the composition of kidney stones . Herein, we report our preliminary results of the simulated monoenergetic imaging of DECT in reducing the effect of metal artifact on the adjacent bone and soft tissue in 47 patients with implanted metal orthopedic devices after factures.
