## Rationale and Objectives

Although spin-echo (SE) sequence has some advantages over gradient-echo sequence in brain imaging, gradient-echo sequence is commonly used for T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) at 3 T because contrast on SE T1WI is widely believed to be poor at 3 T. Recently, gray-white matter contrast on single-slice and multi-slice SE imaging with interslice gap was reported as better at 3 T than at 1.5 T. This study examined the feasibility of interleaved SE T1WI of the brain at 3 T. This study also examined whether presaturation pulse (PP) sufficiently suppresses intra-arterial signals because these signals tend to be hyperintense due to longer T1 at 3 T.

## Materials and Methods

Subjects consisted of 18 healthy volunteers. Two sets of T1WI were performed using SE sequence. One set consisted of imaging without PP, and the other consisted of imaging with PP. Each set contained three types of gapless imaging as follows; sequential, 100% interleaved, and 200% interleaved imaging. In each subject, contrast-to-noise ratio between gray-matter and white-matter (CNR  GM-WM ) and intra-arterial signals were evaluated.

## Results

CNR  GM-WM was significantly higher on interleaved images than on sequential images, regardless of PP ( _P_ < .0001). PP sufficiently suppressed intra-arterial signals ( _P_ < .0001).

## Conclusion

CNR  GM-WM on SE T1WI at 3 T can be improved by interleaved acquisition, and PP sufficiently suppressed intra-arterial signals. Interleaved SE T1WI with PP appears clinically feasible at 3 T.

Gradient-echo (GRE) magnetic resonance (MR) sequences, such as magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo and spoiled gradient echo, are commonly used for T1-weighted imaging at 3 T , since the contrast between gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) on spin-echo (SE) T1-weighted imaging is widely believed to be lower at 3 T than at 1.5 T . On the other hand, some reports assessed a better contrast-to-noise ratio at 3 T by using optimized parameters on SE T1-weighted sequence .

SE sequence has several advantages in use for T1-weighted imaging. One is that magnetic susceptibility artifacts are less prominent on SE sequence than on GRE sequence . Another advantage of SE sequence is that patent intra-arterial lumens appear hypointense (“flow-void”) on SE images, which enable differentiation between patent lumens and subacute intraluminal clots. On the other hand, GRE sequence appears not only intra-arterial subacute clots but also patent intra-arterial lumens as hyperintensity, so intra-arterial subacute clots could be easily missed on GRE . GRE imaging alone should not be used to determine the patency of aneurysms or cerebral arteriovenous malformations in the absence of corroborative images, particularly SE sequence . We recently demonstrated that contrast between GM and WM on single-slice SE T1-weighted MR images is better at 3 T than at 1.5 T . Moreover, we revealed that the influence of multi-slice imaging on contrast between GM and WM is significantly higher at 3 T than at 1.5 T, and suggested that SE T1-weighted imaging may be applicable at 3 T with sufficient interslice gap.
