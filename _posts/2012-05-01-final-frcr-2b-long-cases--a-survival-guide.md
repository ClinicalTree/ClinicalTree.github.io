Drs Aw and Curtis have created in this text a “survival guide” for radiology trainees in their preparation for their final certifying exam in the United Kingdom: the Fellowship of the Royal College of Radiology (FRCR) exam, part 2B. This exam is divided into three sections: a “rapid” reporting session, a long-case reporting session, and an oral examination. This text specifically addresses the style of examination of the long-case reporting session, in which the expectation is that an examinee would generate a full report (including recommendations to the ordering physician) for six cases in less than 45 minutes. This guide provides 60 example cases (broken into 10 six-case sections), with representative images presented in the way they would be presented during the exam. The case selection is heterogeneous, with a dynamic range of difficulties ranging from moderate to very difficult. In its primary intended purpose, this text provides in detail an explanation for each case, as well as an example of an ideal report, as would be given for the FRCR examination. Each report is broken into three sections: observations and interpretations, diagnosis, and management, with items listed in bullet-point format.

For those readers not planning on taking the FRCR exam, this text provides a great overview of important diagnoses and how a report should be written. The cases presented have elements that would be challenging at all levels, from a junior resident preparing to take call to a senior resident interested in reviewing some challenging cases. Although not directed at American residents, the reports are presented in a concise, high-yield manner that would help them refine their understanding of radiology and the important points to convey to an ordering physician. After the management section, the authors provide a succinct one-page or two-page overview of each diagnosis. Additionally, each case is accompanied by a handful of references from peer-reviewed journals to assist the reader in a focused enhancement of understanding for a particular topic. Another helpful feature of the text is its very extensive index, which cross-references all manner of cases, diagnoses, and imaging modalities.

One issue that might be seen as a limitation of the text is its lack of coverage of cross-sectional nuclear medicine studies, such as positron emission tomography/computed tomography. This is understandable from the authors’ point of view, as the FRCR exam does not currently test on positron emission tomographic scans, and as such is not an inadequacy in its primary purpose. Other than this, the guide covers all radiographic modalities, including plain film, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, planar nuclear medicine, and fluoroscopy. The included images are relatively small in size but are of high enough resolution that the findings are still easily discernable. Partly because of the small images, the book itself is small enough to carry in a large pocket or purse, so that one could review cases during downtime in the reading room. Although I have not personally taken the FRCR exam, after some research on the subject, I feel that this would be a great adjunctive tool to anyone studying for this exam. Although there are many general texts out there, I would also recommend that non-UK radiologists check this out, too. The cases are challenging, probably very low yield for medical students or residents who are just starting out, but for anyone with a basic level of radiologic knowledge, this guide provides a great case-based review of general radiology. In my opinion, it would be great for preparation for American residents before taking call or seniors who want to try themselves on some difficult cases before the end of their residencies.
