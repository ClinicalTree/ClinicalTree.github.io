This is a case-based textbook of musculoskeletal imaging. The intended audience includes anyone interested in learning about musculoskeletal imaging, but it is written primarily for residency level training. The author, Dr. Joseph S. Yu, is the section chief of musculoskeletal radiologist at The Ohio State University.

The standard case review series format is used. Each case has a selected number of images that allow the reader to construct a differential diagnosis followed by four questions designed to highlight teaching points related to the imaging or pathology. The questions are answered on the following page along with a comment section that entails a brief but detailed discussion of the pertinent pathology and imaging highlights. There are three levels of case difficulty progressing from “opening round” to “fair game” and finally to “challenge cases.”

This is an excellent addition to the case review series. I have not read the first edition, so I cannot make a comparison. Selected cases include a diverse breadth of pathology and include all the imaging modalities used in musculoskeletal imaging. The case selection is very appropriate for board preparation and includes a wide breadth of pathology. The follow-up questions are helpful for focusing on key concepts and the comment sections are very well written with pertinent discussions.

This is an excellent addition to the case review series and a must have for any radiology resident, particularly when preparing for Lousiville. It is a useful tool for learning about musculoskeletal imaging, pathology, as well as management issues. Dr. Yu does an excellent job at discussing differential diagnoses along with many pearls and discriminators to narrow your differential to a best diagnosis.
