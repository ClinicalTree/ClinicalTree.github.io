_Brain Imaging_ is an installment of the _Dx-Direct: Direct Diagnosis in Radiology_ series published by Thieme. This book limits its scope to imaging of the brain. Spine and head/neck imaging are covered in other texts, along with the other major radiologic subspecialties.

This book is an adaptation of the 2006 original German edition, translated by John Grossman, MD. The translation is excellent with clear, essentially native prose, leaving hardly a hint of its non-English roots. The only vestiges of its German origin are scattered references to such organizations as the German Society of Neuropediatrics and quotations of European epidemiologic data.

_Brain Imaging_ is organized by diagnosis, grouped into 11 categorical chapters based variably on etiology (eg, “Trauma,” “Inflammation”), type of lesion (“Aneurysms,” “Tumors”), or anatomic structure (“Meninges,” “Ventricles and Cisterns”). As in many radiology texts, precise categorization of diseases and radiologic findings without overlap or duplication is difficult, but the chosen approach in this text, along with a comprehensive table of contents and index, allows efficient location of any desired information. Two additional chapters cover “Artifacts in MRI” and “Postoperative Changes,” practical discussions that, though brief, provide a concise review of these common topics.

Each diagnosis is presented in two to five pages with bullet-point style discussion under five subheadings. “Definition” includes epidemiologic data and relevant pathophysiology. “Imaging Signs” spans multiple relevant modalities, touching on advanced imaging techniques such as perfusion imaging in computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) and MR spectroscopy. “Clinical Aspects” presents a concise overview of typical presentation, treatment options, and clinical course/prognosis of the disease. “Differential Diagnosis” provides a list of radiographically similar diagnoses, including features that can be used to distinguish them. “Tips and Pitfalls” gives a few final points, including common errors or atypical presentations that may be misinterpreted. An average of three to five images (annotated where appropriate) accompany each diagnosis. This multifaceted presentation has the potential to add depth to the reader's knowledge and increase the relevance of his or her interpretations to referring clinicians while sparing the reader from a barrage of irrelevant details that might detract from the important points.

This 300-page paperback book, measuring 5 by 7.5 inches, is highly portable, fitting easily into a bag or coat pocket for quick reference. The images are small, but glossy paper and high-quality printing result in overall image quality that is above average compared with similar texts.

The concise, straight-to-the-point style of this book makes it an easy and quick read. A resident or even a medical student would find it a useful introduction to common diagnoses in brain imaging. Those studying for board exams could use this book for an efficient review or handy reference while supplementing with case-based reviews. For more experienced readers, such as fellows or practicing radiologists, a specific diagnosis chapter might be consulted for a quick refresher or to suggest a differential diagnosis for a case encountered at the workstation.
