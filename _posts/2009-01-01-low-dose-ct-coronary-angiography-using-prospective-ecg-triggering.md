## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of mean heart rate (HR) and HR variability on image quality in low-dose computed tomographic coronary angiography (CTCA) using prospective electrocardiographic (ECG) triggering.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred thirty-six consecutive patients were scheduled for low-dose CTCA using prospective ECG triggering. The image quality of all coronary segments was rated on a 5-point scale by two independent readers (scores of 1–3 were considered diagnostic, and scores of 4 and 5 were considered nondiagnostic). Intravenous β blockers were administered targeting HR < 65 beats/min before scanning, but not if HR increased during scanning.

## Results

After the exclusion of seven patients because of arrhythmia ( _n_ = 4) or mean HRs > 65 beats/min despite using β blockers ( _n_ = 3), 129 patients underwent computed tomographic scanning. The estimated mean effective radiation dose was 2.2 ± 0.7 mSv (range, 1.1–3.5). The mean HR during scanning was 58.4 ± 6.6 beats/min (range, 44.2–80.1), with a variability of 1.6 ± 1.0 beats/min (range, 0.2–5.3). Mean HR ( _r_ = 0.49, _P_ < .001) but not mean HR variability ( _r_ = 0.14) was related to image quality. Nondiagnostic image quality on CTCA was found in 5% of the coronary segments in 21 of 129 patients. However, on receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a cutoff HR of 62 beats/min was determined, below which nondiagnostic segments were significantly less frequent (2% vs 14%, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Prospective triggering allows low-dose CTCA but requires a low HR. Because a low HR offers a prolonged diastole, widening the optimal phase for scanning, HR variability seems to have a negligible impact on image quality.

The implementation of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) for coronary angiography allows fast imaging as well as increased temporal and spatial resolution ( ). However, motion artifacts caused by a higher heart rate (HR) or HR variability remain an issue, because they affect image quality. In four-slice and 16-slice MDCT, a higher HR has shown to cause a relevant degradation of image quality ( ). With 64-slice MDCT, the influence of HR and HR variability on image quality remains controversial, with such an effect reported by some authors ( ) but not by others ( ).

Despite further technical refinements and the introduction of dual-source computed tomographic (CT) coronary angiography (CTCA), leading to better temporal resolution, there still appears to be a negative influence of HR variability ( ) or both HR and HR variability ( ) on image quality. To minimize motion artifacts resulting from high HR or HR variability, images are usually reconstructed at the phase of near quiescence in mid-diastole called diastasis ( ). Scanning protocols using a spiral acquisition mode offer the opportunity for image reconstruction at any given point throughout the cardiac cycle, allowing the retrospective selection of any phase in the RR interval ( ) and the use of multisegment reconstructions for improving temporal resolution. With the introduction of prospective electrocardiographic (ECG) triggering ( ), radiation is administered at only one predefined time point in the cardiac cycle. This substantially reduces the effective radiation dose ( ) but in turn provides only a single data set for image reconstruction, achieving diagnostic image quality.
