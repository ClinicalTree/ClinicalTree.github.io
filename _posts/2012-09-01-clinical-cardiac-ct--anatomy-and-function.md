This second edition focuses on cardiac computed tomography (CT) with two chapters dedicated to aortic diseases. The book contains 16 chapters and includes a discussion of cardiac CT imaging techniques and radiation dose. Two chapters are dedicated to normal cardiac anatomy or function. Approximately 25% of the text discusses issues related to coronary imaging (eg, coronary anomalies, calcium scoring, atherosclerosis). Remaining chapters focus on specific clinical scenarios or pathology at specific anatomic sites.

Book content is appropriately weighted given the expected distribution of clinical cases in cardiac imaging. Illustrations and figures are high quality. They represent excellent examples of the pathology being discussed. Figures are clearly annotated with appropriately detailed legends. Although multiple authors have contributed to this book, a consistent clear writing style is present.

Chapter content is appropriately detailed for medical students and radiology residents. Radiology fellows and practicing radiologists would also find this a useful reference given the large number of high-quality images. Subspecialists may find this text a useful starting point for literature review given comprehensive references at the end of each chapter.

Overall, this is a well-organized text with complete, high-quality figures. It is a welcome addition to the limited supply of books specifically focusing on cardiac CT.
