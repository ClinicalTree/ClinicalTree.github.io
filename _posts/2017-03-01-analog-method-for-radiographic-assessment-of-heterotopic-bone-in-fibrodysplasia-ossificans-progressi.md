## Rationale and Objectives

Severe progressive multifocal heterotopic ossification (HO) is a rare occurrence seen predominantly in patients who have fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and is difficult to quantitate owing to patient-, disease-, logistical-, and radiation-related issues. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a scoring system based on plain radiographs for quantitative assessment of HO lesions in patients with FOP.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained from the University of Pennsylvania, and all data comply with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved the use of mice in this study. First, we used a mouse model of FOP-like HO to validate a semiquantitative analog scale for estimating relative heterotopic bone volume. Second, we used this validated scale to estimate the relative amount of HO from a retrospective analysis of plain radiographs from 63 patients with classic FOP. Finally, the scale was applied to a retrospective analysis of computed tomographic images from three patients with FOP.

## Results

In the FOP-mouse model, the observed rating on the analog scale is highly correlated to heterotopic bone volumes measured by microcomputed tomography ( _R_ 2 = 0.89). The scoring system that was applied to radiographs of patients with FOP captured the clinical range of HO typically present at all axial and appendicular sites. Analysis of computed tomographic scans of patients with FOP found that observed radiograph ratings were highly correlated with HO volume ( _R_ 2 = 0.80).

## Conclusions

The scoring system described here could enable practical, quantitative assessment of HO in clinical trials to evaluate new treatment modalities, especially for FOP. The development of the six-point analog scale described here provides and validates a much-needed, reproducible, and quantifiable method for describing and assessing HO in patients with FOP. This scale has the potential to be a key descriptor that can inform patients with FOP and clinicians about disease progression and response of HO lesions to interventions and treatments.

## Introduction

Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) (Mendelian Inheritance in Man #135100) is a severely disabling heritable disorder characterized by congenital malformations of the great toes and progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) that forms qualitatively normal bone at extraskeletal sites . During the first decade of life, affected children experience episodic exacerbations of painful soft tissue swellings (flare-ups), often precipitated by soft tissue injury, intramuscular injections, viral infection, muscular stretching, falls, or muscular fatigue . These flare-ups transform skeletal muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia, and aponeuroses into heterotopic bone, rendering movement restricted or impossible. Classic FOP is caused by a recurrent activating mutation (c.617G>A; R206H) in the gene encoding activin A receptor type I/activin-like kinase 2 ( _ACVR1/ALK2_ ), a bone morphogenetic protein type I receptor . At present, there is no definitive treatment, but emerging drug development offers the possibility of beneficial interventions .

Although multiple classification systems grade the severity of focal HO , none is applicable to progressive multifocal HO, nor does any adequately measure volumetric bone by plain radiographs. A simple method for quantifying extraskeletal bone formation would be useful to assess the effectiveness of evolving treatments, especially for FOP, where rigid immobility because of progressive multifocal HO often precludes serial quantitative computed tomographic (CT) scans at major urban medical centers.
