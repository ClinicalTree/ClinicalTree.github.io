## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee's (ACR-IFC) recommendations for defining and following up abnormal incidental abdominopelvic lymph nodes.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 59 lymph nodes satisfying ACR-IFC criteria as incidental (no malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder) and with sufficient follow-up to classify as benign (biopsy, decreased size, ≥12-month stability) or malignant (biopsy, detection of primary malignancy combined with either fluorodeoxyglucose hyperactivity or increase in size of the node) were included. Two radiologists independently assessed nodes for suspicious features by ACR-IFC criteria (round with indistinct hilum, hypervascularity, necrosis, cluster ≥3 nodes, cluster ≥2 nodes in ≥2 stations, size ≥1 cm in retroperitoneum). Outcomes were assessed with attention to ACR-IFC's recommendation for initial 3-month follow-up.

## Results

A total of 8.5% of nodes were malignant; 91.5% were benign. Two of six malignant nodes were stable at 3 to <6-month follow-up before diagnosis; diagnosis of four of five malignant nodes was facilitated by later development of non-nodal sites of tumor. A total of 13, 5, 8, and 9 nodes were deemed benign given a decrease at <3 months, 3–5 months, 6–11 months, or ≥12 months of follow-up. No ACR-IFC feature differentiated benign and malignant nodes ( _P_ = 0.164–1.0). A cluster ≥3 nodes was present in 88.1%–93.2% of nodes. A total of 96.6%–98.3% had ≥1 suspicious feature for both readers. Necrosis and hypervascularity were not identified in any node.

## Conclusions

ACR-IFC imaging features overwhelmingly classified incidental nodes as abnormal, although did not differentiate benign and malignant nodes. Nodes stable at the ACR-IFC's advised initial 3-month follow-up were occasionally proven malignant or decreased on further imaging. Refinement of imaging criteria to define nodes of particularly high risk, integrated with other clinical criteria, may help optimize the follow-up of incidental abdominopelvic lymph nodes.

## Introduction

Incidental lymph nodes are a common finding on abdominopelvic imaging, although are benign in a large majority of cases , rarely representing malignancy. However, benign and malignant lymph nodes overlap in imaging features as well as in their behavior on initial short-term follow-up imaging . Given their frequency and nonspecific imaging characteristics, incidental lymph nodes present a large diagnostic challenge that may ultimately be associated with clinical uncertainty, patient anxiety, and excess follow-up imaging.

To address this challenge, the American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee (ACR-IFC) published a white paper in 2013 addressing the management of incidental abdominopelvic lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) . This white paper sought to provide both imaging criteria for considering nodes to be abnormal and warranting further evaluation, as well as guidance regarding the appropriate imaging surveillance of such nodes. According to the ACR-IFC, incidental lymph nodes are deemed abnormal if showing at least one of any of a set of imaging features incorporating nodal number, size, architecture, and enhancement pattern. For nodes deemed to be abnormal, the white paper emphasizes the value of a comparison to any relevant prior imaging. For patients with a known or suspected malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder, further evaluation of the node, including possible biopsy, is suggested at the time of detection, as clinically appropriate. For incidental nodes in remaining patients, a short-term follow-up CT is suggested in approximately 3 months to allow time for interval clinical management and response to any intervening antibiotics or other medical management. This short-term 3-month examination similarly applies for follow-up of lymph nodes in patients with non-neoplastic conditions, such as acute pancreatitis, to assess for improvement or resolution. Furthermore, incidental lymph nodes may be deemed benign and not warranting any further imaging or other evaluation if remaining stable on follow-up imaging after 1 year.
