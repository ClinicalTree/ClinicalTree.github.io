## Rationale and Objectives

This study investigated what factors radiologists take into account when estimating emphysema severity and assessed quantitative computed tomography (CT) measurements of low attenuation areas.

## Materials and Methods

CT scans and spirometry were obtained on 1519 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) subjects, 269 smoker controls, and 184 nonsmoker controls from the Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Indentify Surrogate Endpoints (ECLIPSE) study. CT scans were analyzed using the threshold technique (%<−950HU) and a low attenuation cluster analysis. Two radiologists scored emphysema severity (0 to 5 scale), described the predominant type and distribution of emphysema, and the presence of suspected small airways disease.

## Results

The percent low attenuation area (%LAA) and visual scores of emphysema severity correlated well ( _r_ = 0.77, _P_ < .001). %LAA, low attenuation cluster analysis, and absence of radiologist described gas trapping, distribution, and predominant type of emphysema were predictors of visual scores of emphysema severity (all _P_ < .001). CT scans scored as showing regions of gas trapping had smaller lesions for a similar %LAA than those without ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Visual estimates of emphysema are not only determined by the extent of LAA, but also by lesion size, predominant type, and distribution of emphysema and presence/absence of areas of small airways disease. A computer analysis of low attenuation cluster size helps quantitative algorithms discriminate low attenuation areas from gas trapping, image noise, and emphysema.

The introduction of computed tomography (CT) has changed the way that clinicians diagnose and quantify the extent of emphysema in living individuals. It was recognized early on that the frequency distribution of x-ray attenuation values in a CT image of the lung (CT densitometry) could produce an estimate of the extent of emphysema . Even though there has been a great deal of attention given to densitometric assessment of emphysema , the daily clinical routine is still to visually grade disease extent and severity.

Both densitometry and visual grading of emphysema extent have been shown to correlate well with the extent of emphysema on histology specimens. However, the estimations produced by densitometry have been reported to be similar to the extent of emphysema in histology specimens, whereas visual estimations tend to overestimate the extent of emphysema . Visual scores, on the other hand, have been reported to show stronger associations with spirometry data , the core diagnostic test to detect and stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) .

Corresponding computed tomography (CT) images from the carina ( d,e,f ) and the inferior pulmonary vein (g, h, i) are also shown. Subject A is considered to have trivial emphysema by radiologists and %LAA assessment as indicated by the lack of colored regions in the three-dimensional reconstruction of the LAC analysis (a) and the lack of low attenuating regions in CT images. Subject B has severe emphysema indicated by the large colored regions (b) and the large low attenuating areas indicated by arrows ( ) (e,h) . Subject C has mild emphysema with small lesions indicated individual colored regions in the upper lobes (c) and marked by arrows ( ) (f) and large diffuse areas of decreased attenuation suggesting “gas-trapping” from small airways disease (arrowhead ) (i) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/QuantifyingtheExtentofEmphysema/0_1s20S1076633211000535.jpg)
