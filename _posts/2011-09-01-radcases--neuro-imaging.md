This first-edition, case review book of neuroradiology is a great review book for radiology residents reviewing for oral boards and for neuroradiologists reviewing for their certificates of added qualifications. It is also a useful resource for general radiologists who are interested in a rapid review of neuroradiology. It can be used for rapid review of imaging features and generating short differential diagnoses. The book makes use of current literature, which is cited at the end of the book for easy reference. This book is presented in a format similar to the Thieme’s _Case Review_ series, except that there are no questions shown with each case.

There is no particular organization to the cases shown in the book, which may be a good and a bad thing. For those reviewing, it is nice that the cases are random. For residents early on in their training, this may not be the best first choice of books to read.

The images in the book are of adequate size and of good quality. However, I do believe the images in the book could benefit from a larger size. As a bonus, the book includes access to 100 more cases online, chosen at random from a bank 250 cases, bringing the total to 250 cases. The online images are of great quality, and the format of the online cases is exactly the same as in the book. In terms of breadth of cases, neck cases are underrepresented. However, overall, this book is an excellent resource for residents, neuroradiology fellows, and radiologists for rapid review.
