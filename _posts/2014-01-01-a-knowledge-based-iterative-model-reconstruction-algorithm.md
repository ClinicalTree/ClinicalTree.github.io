## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate whether “full” iterative reconstruction, a knowledge-based iterative model reconstruction (IMR), enables radiation dose reduction by 80% at cardiac computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 23 patients (15 men, eight women; mean age 64.3 ± 13.4 years) who underwent retrospectively electrocardiography-gated cardiac CT with dose modulation were evaluated. We compared full-dose (FD; 730 mAs) images reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) technique and the low-dose (LD; 146 mAs) images reconstructed with FBP and IMR techniques. Objective and subjective image quality parameters were compared among the three different CT images.

## Results

There was no significant difference in the CT attenuation among the three reconstructions. The mean image noise of LD-IMR (18.3 ± 10.6 Hounsfield units \[HU\]) was significantly lowest among the three reconstructions (41.9 ± 15.3 HU for FD-FBP and 109.9 ± 42.6 HU for LD-FBP; _P_ < .01). The contrast-to-noise ratio of LD-IMR was better than that of FD-FBP and LD-FBP ( _P_ < .01). Visual evaluation score was also highest for LD-IMR.

## Conclusions

The IMR can provide improved image quality at super-low-dose cardiac CT with 20% of the standard tube current.

Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a useful diagnostic imaging modality for the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease in select patient groups . Although the diagnostic performance of cardiac CT is high for the detection and exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease , there are concerns regarding potential stochastic risks related to ionizing radiation . According to Hausleiter et al. , the mean effective dose at cardiac CT was 12 mSv; the range was 5–30 mSv. To minimize the patient dose, conventional electrocardiographic (ECG)-dependent tube current modulation is used, achieving moderate dose savings of 37%–40% . Another radiation dose saving technique, prospective “step-and-shoot” ECG-triggering, allows for a radiation dose reduction of 77%–79% . However, it requires a steady low heart rate (HR), which is not obtainable in all patients, and therefore, retrospectively ECG-gated cardiac CT is still useful for some patients. Also, the evaluation of cardiac function is not possible because images are acquired at a single, predetermined, end-diastolic, quiescent phase. It is critically important to balance the desire for low-radiation doses with the likelihood of obtaining diagnostically useful images.

An iterative reconstruction algorithm for CT was introduced to help reduce the quantum noise associated with standard convolution–filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithms . Studies that evaluated the quality of images acquired with a hybrid type of iterative reconstruction indicated that a radiation dose reduction of 23%–66% was possible while maintaining the image quality , but a certain amount of image noise and artifacts are still present. Iterative model reconstruction (IMR), a fully iterative algorithm, represents the latest advance in the field of reconstruction techniques. It applies a knowledge-based approach that yields improved image quality and virtually noise-free images through the iterative minimization of the penalty-based cost function. IMR technique can reconstruct the cardiac CT images within 5 minutes, and we posit it can be applicable in clinical practice. To our knowledge, there is no reported study involving comparative evaluation on a clinical setting of the knowledge-based iterative reconstruction algorithm and FBP algorithm at cardiac CT.
