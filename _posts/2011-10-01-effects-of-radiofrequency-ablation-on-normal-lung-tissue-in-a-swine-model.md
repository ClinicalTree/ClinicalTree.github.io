## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the effect of radiofrequency (RF) ablation on normal lung tissue in an animal model.

## Materials and Methods

RF ablation of lung tissue was performed on eight swine under computed tomographic control. Group A ( _n_ = 4) received peripheral ablation (subpleural needle placement) and group B ( _n_ = 4) received central ablation (hilar needle placement). RF ablation was applied via a single 4.5-gauge internally cooled electrode with a 2-cm tip for 12 minutes. The ablation was monitored with computed tomography at 3, 7, and 12 minutes, and 10 minutes after ablation. After 3, 7, 40, and 60 days, computed tomography was performed, and the animals were sacrificed to examine the lung tissue both macroscopically and histopathologically.

## Results

There were no deaths from RF ablation. In group A, coagulative necrosis was resorbed almost completely and transformed into a fibrotic scar after 60 days. No pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or lung abscess was observed. In group B, there was also a transformation of the necrosis into connective tissue. Neither the pulmonary vessels nor the bronchi of the hilum abutting the coagulative necrosis were damaged. After 60 days, no vascular thrombosis, bleeding, aneurysm, bronchial stenosis, or bronchopulmonary fistula was observed.

## Conclusion

RF ablation of lung tissue affects coagulation necrosis, causing scar transformation. There was no damage to either great vessels or bronchi. The application of RF ablation for tumors located in or near functional structures appears feasible without severe complications.

Radiofrequency (RF) ablation is a therapeutic option for the treatment of unresectable lung tumors . To obtain complete necrosis of tumors, the extent of coagulative necrosis must include 0.5–1.0 cm of surrounding normal lung tissue . RF ablation has also been applied to central tumors near vital structures of the lung hilum. However, there are a few reports describing severe complications after ablation. Other authors applying ablation to hilar lesions did not observe such complications . There are no reports investigating the effects of thermal coagulation on either large vessels or bronchi. The pneumothorax rate was 28%, with a 10% chest tube insertion rate . To assess the risk of peripheral and central RF ablation, we believe it is necessary to investigate the effects of RF ablation on normal lung tissue, especially on the lung hilum, in an animal model.

## Materials and methods

Experiments were carried out on eight 3- to 5-month-old female pigs (Deutsches Landschwein) with a mean weight of 34.3 kg (range, 29–43 kg). The animals were divided into two groups: group A consisted of four pigs that received peripheral RF ablation; group B consisted of four pigs that received central RF ablation. At 3, 7, 40, and 60 days after RF ablation, the pigs were examined with computed tomography (CT). The pigs in each group were sacrificed immediately after CT. Lung specimens were removed and prepared for macroscopic and histopathological examination. The present study conformed to the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Veterinary Protection Law, No. 30, 1998; Thuringia, Germany) and was approved by the Veterinary Department of the Thuringian State Authority for Food Protection and Fair Trading.
