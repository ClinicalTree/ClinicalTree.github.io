## Rationale and Objectives

This study aims to investigate the value of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-derived parameters for early evaluation of the efficiency of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment for rabbit liver VX2 tumor.

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen rabbit liver VX2 tumor models were constructed, and computed tomography–guided RFA was performed. One day before and 7 days after RFA, 18 models underwent magnetic resonance imaging, including contrast-enhanced imaging and IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging with 16 _b_ -factors (0–1000 s/mm  2 ). Post-RFA liver tumors were segmented into viable tumor, inflammatory reaction, and ablation necrotic regions according to gross and histopathologic examinations. Parameters derived from IVIM were calculated. One-way analysis of variance and least significant difference test were used for comparisons among the three regions. The diagnostic performance of parameters was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

## Results

_ADC_ total , _D_ , and _f_ values were significantly lower in viable tumor than in inflammatory reaction regions (all _P_ < .05), but _D_ \\* showed no significant difference between the two regions. _ADC_ total values of viable tumor regions were significantly lower than that of ablation necrotic regions ( _P_ = .007), but _D_ \\* values of necrotic regions were significantly lower than that of viable tumor regions ( _P_ = .045). In ROC analysis, _ADC_ showed the highest area under the ROC curve for differentiating inflammatory reaction from viable tumor region.

## Conclusions

_ADC_ total , _D_ , and _f_ were valuable discriminating markers for differentiation between regions of viable tumor and inflammatory reaction in post-RFA tumor, especially _ADC_ total outperformed the other two parameters with higher diagnostic performance.

## Introduction

As one of minimally invasive approaches, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been widely used in the treatment of malignant hepatic tumors, especially in patients with unresectable malignancies. Although RFA has achieved promising treatment effects, the incidence of local residual tumors or recurrence after RFA still remains high , which indicates treatment failure and the need for further therapy. Thus, it is of great importance for imaging assessment to detect viable tumor tissue accurately early after RFA. At an early stage after RFA, the inflammatory reaction to the thermal stress around the ablation zone is usually obvious and can last for up to 6 months after RFA . Some imaging features of inflammatory reaction regions may overlap with those of viable tumor regions, such as shape, density or signal intensity, and enhancement pattern . Conventional imaging examination methods (magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\] or computed tomography \[CT\]) based on morphological characteristics cannot provide additional information, which makes it difficult to differentiate between regions of viable tumor and inflammatory reaction within liver tumors after RFA.

Magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has shown its value in differential diagnosis and treatment follow-up for liver tumors. However, within living tissue, the signal intensity decay vs _b_ -value (gradient intensity) is influenced simultaneously by microcirculation perfusion and pure molecular diffusion . The new intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) theory can distinguish perfusion effects from diffusion effects using multiple _b_ -value imaging and biexponential fit analysis . In recent years, IVIM theory has been applied to many clinical studies in abdominal diseases . Therefore, we hypothesize that IVIM may help characterize tissue components in the liver tumor after RFA.
