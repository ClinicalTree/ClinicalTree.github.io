## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this report is to describe preliminary experience with an educational tool implemented to improve radiology education and documentation, in anticipation of upcoming changes from the American Board of Radiology and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.

## Materials and Methods

Monthly online end-of-rotation examinations were developed for junior radiology residents. Examinations were administered over a period of 6 months, after which satisfaction surveys were administered to residents and faculty members.

## Results

Satisfaction with end-of-rotation examinations was high for residents and faculty members, but the level of resident satisfaction was not statistically different when compared to that of residents who had taken fewer examinations.

## Conclusions

End-of-rotation examinations are relatively straightforward to implement and facilitate recurring, structured, and meaningful resident evaluation and feedback. Future studies will explore whether examinations such as these result in improved clinical competency.

Because of recent and upcoming changes from both the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Radiology (ABR), radiology residency education will change dramatically over the next few years. By 2011, ACGME has mandated that all “programs are making data-driven improvements” when it comes to core competencies and specialty-specific requirements . In 2013, the first group of radiology residents will take the new ABR computerized core examination, with the first computerized certifying examination to follow in 2015 . The certifying examination will be pushed back into the second year after residency, which allows for new possibilities in the fourth year of radiology residency . To stay ahead of the curve with all of these changes, radiology residency programs need to consider the most efficient means of teaching and evaluating residents, as well as documenting the process . In this article, we discuss one possible solution for these growing program demands.

Beginning in July of the 2010–2011 academic year, the diagnostic radiology residents at our training program started taking monthly online end-of-rotation (EOR) examinations, which were specific to each radiology subspecialty. The EOR examination provided a structured framework for online examination and one-on-one evaluation between residents and attending radiologists.
