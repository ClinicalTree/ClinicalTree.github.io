## Rationale and Objectives

A prospective randomized study was conducted to assess whether an electronic learning module was as effective as a didactic lecture to teach musculoskeletal ultrasound to radiology residents.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-three residents were randomized into a module group versus a didactic group. All residents took a written “pretest” to assess baseline knowledge. Subsequently, the 17 residents in the didactic group attended a live didactic session delivered by a subspecialist musculoskeletal radiology faculty member. The 16 residents in the module group completed an electronic learning module that contained similar content to the live didactic session. Finally, all residents completed a written “posttest,” which served as the outcome measure.

## Results

Mean score significantly improved between pre- and posttest by 10.6 ± 11.2% in the didactic group (DG; _P_ = 0.002) and 14.0 ± 8.2% in the module group (MG; _P_ < 0.001), with a nonsignificant difference between groups ( _P_ = 0.4). Mean pretest scores (75.6 ± 9.4% DG and 73.7 ± 9.2% MG, _P_ = 0.6) and posttest scores (86.2 ± 9.7% DG and 87.7 ± 5.2% MG, _P_ = 0.5) were not significantly different. The adjusted mean difference in posttest scores between groups was −1.9% (95% confidence interval: −7.2 to 3.5%).

## Conclusion

If didactic training was better than electonic module training, the difference was relatively small (<5%). A similar web-based, interactive module could be employed to teach American Board of Radiology Core Examination and Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Diagnostic Radiology Milestone musculoskeletal ultrasound learning objectives to radiology residents. An electronic module could reduce demands on faculty staff time invested in musculoskeletal ultrasound training and be more widely available to residents.

## Introduction

Ultrasound is a dynamic, safe, relatively low-cost, portable, and rapidly growing cross-sectional imaging modality, comprising nearly 25% of all imaging studies performed globally . In the US Medicare/Medicaid patient population, musculoskeletal (MSK) ultrasound volume has increased by 316% from 2000 to 2009, with approximately 234,000 reimbursed MSK ultrasound procedures in 2009, 38.9% of which were performed by radiologists . Accordingly, the new American Board of Radiology (ABR) Diagnostic Radiology Core Examination covers multiple MSK ultrasound topics. As detailed in the ABR Core Examination study guide, these topics include normal anatomy, pathology, and American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for effective clinical use of ultrasound and its integration with complementary cross-sectional imaging studies . In addition, the 2012 ACGME and ABR Diagnostic Radiology Milestones Project includes “recognition of suboptimal images” and “application of physical principles to optimize image quality” within the expected resident competencies . To address these requirements for radiology residents, generalized curricular content guidelines were recently published by the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound Resident Curriculum based on expert opinion ; but to date, no prospective studies have evaluated specific educational modalities for teaching MSK ultrasound to radiology residents, and training methods remain nonstandardized at the national level.

Point of care ultrasound is rapidly finding diagnostic and therapeutic niches within numerous medical specialties, and research regarding emerging curricula is booming in kind. A review of recent literature regarding development of ultrasound curricula for physicians in training reveals studies spanning multiple disciplines just within the past 2 years—ie, emergency medicine , rheumatology , sports medicine , general surgery , physical medicine and rehabilitation , neurosurgery , and anesthesia . Many of these curricula contain both didactic and simulation-based, “hands-on” teaching sessions—allowing tailored education that focuses on the trainee within a realistic and safe environment. Even so, data to support specific training methods for ultrasound remain limited and application dependent.

![Figure 2, Study design flowchart. Thirty-three radiology residents were recruited and subsequently randomized by postgraduate-year (PGY) level into a module training or a didactic training group, with 2 weeks between the enrollment and the training sessions. In total, 16 participants in each group were included in data analysis. Please see the Subjects and Methods section for further details. *Six individuals of corresponding PGY level were randomly swapped between the two groups because of scheduling conflicts that emerged following initial randomization. †One individual arrived 30 minutes late to the didactic session and was excluded from data analysis.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/MusculoskeletalUltrasoundTrainingforRadiologyResidents/1_1s20S1076633216001173.jpg)
