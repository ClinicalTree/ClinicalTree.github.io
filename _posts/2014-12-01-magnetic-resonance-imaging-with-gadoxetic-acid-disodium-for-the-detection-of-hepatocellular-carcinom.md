## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadoxetic acid disodium for the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

## Materials and Methods

Various databases were searched for original articles published before May 2013. Studies were selected, which performed MRI with gadoxetic acid disodium to detect and diagnose HCC and which presented sufficient data to allow construction of contingency tables. For each study, the true-positive, false-positive, true-negative, and false-negative values were extracted or derived, and 2 × 2 contingency tables were constructed. The heterogeneity test, the threshold effect test, the publication bias analysis, and subgroup analyses were performed.

## Results

From 623 citations, 18 were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 2572 lesions. We detected heterogeneity between studies and evidence of publication bias. The methodological quality was moderate. The pooled weighted sensitivity was 0.91 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.90–0.93), the specificity was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93–0.96), the positive likelihood ratio was 12.31 (95% CI, 7.66–19.78), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.07–0.13), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 159.72 (95% CI, 91.72–276.08). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96–0.99).

## Conclusions

MRI with gadoxetic acid disodium is a noninvasive and no radiation exposure imaging modality with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of HCC. Nonetheless, it should be applied cautiously in liver nodule <1 cm, and large-scale well-designed trials are necessary to assess its clinical value.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major contributor to cancer incidence and mortality worldwide . HCC incidence rates have been increasing in the United States among most racial and ethnic groups . The prognosis for HCC has improved in recent years because more cases are diagnosed at an early stage . To provide better treatment options for patients, it is important to improve the diagnostic accuracy of HCC detection methods, especially at early stages of the disease.

To diagnose HCC, some useful, noninvasive, imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be used. In contrast to multidetector CT (MDCT) techniques, MRI has emerged as the preferred radiologic tool for the investigation of HCC. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI with liver-specific contrast agents, such as gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (gadoxetic acid disodium or Gd-EOB-DTPA, Primovist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) can provide tissue-specific physiological information, thereby facilitating liver cancer characterization . Gadoxetate disodium has several advantageous properties for evaluating liver lesions. After injection, normal areas of the liver exhibit T1 shortening because of specific hepatocyte uptake, whereas most focal liver lesions, such as HCC and hepatic metastases, do not exhibit T1 shortening . Combined with the three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence technique, which provides excellent spatial resolution, gadoxetate disodium–enhanced MRI may be useful in detecting small HCC .
