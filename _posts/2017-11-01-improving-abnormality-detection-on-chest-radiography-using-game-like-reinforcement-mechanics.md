## Rationale and Objectives

Despite their increasing prevalence, online textbooks, question banks, and digital references focus primarily on explicit knowledge. Implicit skills such as abnormality detection require repeated practice on clinical service and have few digital substitutes. Using mechanics traditionally deployed in video games such as clearly defined goals, rapid-fire levels, and narrow time constraints may be an effective way to teach implicit skills.

## Materials and Methods

We created a freely available, online module to evaluate the ability of individuals to differentiate between normal and abnormal chest radiographs by implementing mechanics, including instantaneous feedback, rapid-fire cases, and 15-second timers. Volunteer subjects completed the modules and were separated based on formal experience with chest radiography. Performance between training and testing sets were measured for each group, and a survey was administered after each session.

## Results

The module contained 74 cases and took approximately 20 minutes to complete. Thirty-two cases were normal radiographs and 56 cases were abnormal. Of the 60 volunteers recruited, 25 were “never trained” and 35 were “previously trained.” “Never trained” users scored 21.9 out of 37 during training and 24.0 out of 37 during testing (59.1% vs 64.9%, _P_ value <.001). “Previously trained” users scored 28.0 out of 37 during training and 28.3 out of 37 during testing phases (75.6% vs 76.4%, _P_ value = .56). Survey results showed that 87% of all subjects agreed the module is an efficient way of learning, and 83% agreed the rapid-fire module is valuable for medical students.

## Conclusions

A gamified online module may improve the abnormality detection rates of novice interpreters of chest radiography, although experienced interpreters are less likely to derive similar benefits. Users reviewed the educational module favorably.

## Background

Reinforcement learning theory posits that the performance of a learner increases proportionally to the discrepancy between the learner's predicted outcome and the actual outcome as measured in reward or punishment . In radiology, teachers using the Socratic method during clinical service and traditional “hot-seat” style conferences are applying this reinforcement feedback mechanism to education.

The mechanism of reinforcement learning in humans is tied to dopamine D1 receptor and best examined in addiction disorders . These theories are an important part of software engineering, responsible for generating interest in otherwise mundane tasks such as stacking nondescript square quartets in endless layers (also known as Tetris), using Newtonian physics to destroy wooden structures occupied by porcine antagonists (Angry Birds), or in “first-person shooter” video games . Neuropsychology literature suggests that video games act on the reward pathway through striatal dopamine release, a phemenenon demonstrable on positron emission tomography . The patterns of goal-directed, reinforced behavior and dopamine release is similar to those seen in addiction and gambling . Reinforcement learning is also a salient form of information learning. The literature suggests that two primary modes of knowledge acquisition comprise the learning process: explicit vs implicit learning . In explicit knowledge acquisition, a trainee consciously studies a textbook or attends didactic lectures. In implicit learning, a trainee acquires skills without trying to learn but instead by processes of repetitive stimulus–response binding . For example, within radiology, listing the differential diagnosis of a solitary pulmonary nodule requires explicit knowledge, whereas identifying a solitary pulmonary nodule when reviewing a chest radiograph requires implicit skills.
