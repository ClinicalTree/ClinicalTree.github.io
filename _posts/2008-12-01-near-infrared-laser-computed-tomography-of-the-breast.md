## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate a near-infrared (NIR) laser breast imaging system (Computed Tomography Laser Mammography \[CTLM\]) as an adjunct to mammography by means of receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The NIR technique used in this study is based on the absorption of NIR light by hemoglobin. Malignant tumors can be detected by imaging their neovascularization.

## Materials and Methods

Eighty-two patients were examined by both CTLM and mammography. Seventy-nine of the 82 patients underwent biopsies, and three patients had 2-year follow up. Three-dimensional scans were acquired with an NIR laser computed tomographic scanner (the CTLM system) at a slice thickness of 4 mm. Mammograms were analyzed alone and together with CTLM images.

## Results

Histology revealed 37 benign and 42 malignant lesions. For the combination of mammography and CTLM, the area under the ROC curve was significantly larger than for mammography alone. In addition, it was shown that the difference in area under the ROC curve between the combination of both methods and mammography alone was considerably larger for dense breasts than for radiolucent breasts, although these differences were not statistically significant.

## Conclusion

CTLM, used as an adjunct, may serve as a feasible tool to improve the diagnostic capabilities of mammography.

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide ( ). Statistically, in the United States, one in seven women will develop breast cancer during her lifetime ( ). Diagnostic mammography has been shown to have an average sensitivity for the detection of cancer of 75%, and 60 to 80 of every 100 biopsies are negative for cancer. In specific cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can solve some of these problems, increasing sensitivity to about 95%, but with a presently significantly lower specificity than mammography ( ). In addition, MRI examinations are still very expensive. For these reasons, a different approach to breast imaging is desirable.

In theory, optical methods based on near-infrared (NIR) imaging have high potential to become valuable diagnostic tools in breast imaging ( ). There are several reasons for this. First, the breast is fully accessible for imaging with optical methods because of its surface location, relatively small size, and absence of bony structures. Second, at 800 nm, it is possible to exploit the difference in absorption between total hemoglobin and water or fat as an intrinsic contrast. Hemoglobin will then act as a natural contrast medium, and computed laser tomography of the breast will therefore produce a “hemoglobin angiogram,” revealing the normal vascular structures of the breast. In addition, because all tumors require new blood vessels to survive and grow (neoangiogenesis), NIR tomographic imaging can detect tumors within the breast. Third, no ionizing radiation is needed, and the majority of optical systems work without compression, factors that increase its acceptance by patients. Finally, the method is rather inexpensive and easily deployed.

Both CTLM and MRI showed the larger mass that was located medially (M). The smaller mass, located laterally (L), was seen only on MRI and did not appear on near-infrared mammography. Histologic examination revealed a malignant phyllodes tumor as the larger mass and a fibroadenoma as the smaller mass. The structures at the base of the breast in the near-infrared image are probably caused by large vessels and dense glandular tissue.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/NearinfraredLaserComputedTomographyoftheBreast/7_1s20S1076633208004558.jpg)
