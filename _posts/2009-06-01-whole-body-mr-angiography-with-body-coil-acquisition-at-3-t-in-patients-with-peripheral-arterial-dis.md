## Rationale and Objectives

Whole-body magnetic resonance angiography (WB-MRA) at 3 T with body coil acquisition has not previously been investigated. In this study, WB-MRA was performed in this manner using the blood pool contrast agent gadofosveset trisodium.

## Materials and Methods

Eleven consecutive patients (five men, six women) with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (two with critical limb ischemia, nine with claudication) were examined. Conventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the aorta and the inflow and runoff arteries was used as the reference method. WB-MRA was performed using four slightly overlapping stations covering the arteries from the neck to the ankles. The arterial system was divided into 42 segments that were analyzed for the presence of significant arterial disease (≥50% luminal narrowing or occlusion) by two blinded observers.

## Results

Sensitivities for detecting a significant arterial lesion with WB-MRA using gadofosveset as the contrast agent were 0.66 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.49–0.79) and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52–0.81) for the two observers. Specificities were 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.88) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87–0.96), respectively. Intermodality agreement between WB-MRA and DSA was moderate to good, with overall κ values of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.29–0.59) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.5–0.77) for the two observers. Interobserver agreement for WB-MRA was good, at κ = 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50–0.71).

## Conclusion

WB-MRA at 3 T with body coil acquisition in patients with peripheral arterial disease showed good reproducibility but only moderate to good agreement with DSA. Further assessment of the method's clinical application is warranted.

Exact visualization of the arteries and the extent of atherosclerotic disease is essential before peripheral arterial reconstruction. Today, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is still the routine modality for lower-limb imaging at most centers. However, DSA is invasive and carries a small but constant risk for major complications of approximately 2% . Therefore, replacing DSA with a noninvasive alternative, such as duplex ultrasound, computed tomographic angiography, or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), seems promising. These techniques focus on a specific part of the arterial system, despite the fact that atherosclerosis is a systemic disease affecting the entire arterial system. In this point of view, imaging procedures examining the whole arterial system are interesting .

Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including faster gradient systems and extended tabletops, have made contrast-enhanced whole-body MRA (WB-MRA) from head to feet possible . The feasibility and clinical importance of WB-MRA at 1.5 T have been investigated in recent years, leading to acceptance of the method as a valuable diagnostic tool . WB-MRA can be performed with a magnetic resonance system's built-in body coil or different systems of surface coils, allowing better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and higher spatial resolution .
