## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify radiology topics considered essential by residency program directors who will be working with our graduates. Secondary goals were to survey their satisfaction with incoming residents' radiology knowledge, inquire if radiology training was provided in their programs, and identify differences among specialties.

## Materials and Methods

A questionnaire was mailed to all residency program directors in emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and general surgery programs that accepted our graduates between 2005 and 2010. Program directors were asked to rate a list of radiology knowledge and skills topics as essential or nonessential and to answer several questions regarding their residents and programs.

## Results

Ninety-nine surveys were completed (51.3% response rate). Seven skills were considered essential by 90% or more of all respondents. On average, program directors identified 18/28 topics as essential prior to beginning their residency. The mean number identified as essential did not differ by program (F  4, 93 = 0.732, _P_ = .572). Based on analyses of variance comparing each topic by program, the importance of six topics differed significantly. Program directors generally agreed that incoming residents had adequate radiology skills and knowledge when they started their residencies. One hundred percent of the responding emergency medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics programs and 70% to 80% of the general surgery and internal medicine programs provide radiology training.

## Conclusion

There is high agreement among program directors regarding imaging topics they consider essential. Topics considered essential by more than 60% should comprise our core curriculum for all students while less essential topics can be included in elective or program specific curricula.

The use of imaging in clinical care has substantially increased in recent years , and radiology's role continues to expand as fast as new technologies grow. In the past decade, diagnostic imaging services grew at about twice the rate of other health care technologies, including laboratory procedures and pharmaceuticals . Because of these technological advances in medical imaging, radiology has become integral to patient care and clinical management. Radiological studies help clinicians visualize their patient's internal anatomy and narrow differential diagnoses. In addition, minimally invasive image-guided procedures offer definitive therapy. Most medical specialties routinely use medical imaging; thus, medical students need at least a basic understanding of radiological concepts including appropriate imaging utilization and image interpretation.

The Liaison Committee on Medical Education, in the accreditation standards for medical schools, states, “Educational opportunities must be available…in the disciplines that support general medical practice (eg, diagnostic imaging)” . The Liaison Committee on Medical Education does not specify curricular content, how or when this training should occur, by whom it should be taught, or how these opportunities should be achieved or assessed. The Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology (AMSER) has published a National Medical Student Curriculum in Radiology that provides an overarching compendium of possible radiology topics. A valuable educational resource, this document is intended to be used as a resource guide by programs to develop their own curriculum. It will help standardize medical student education in radiology, but is not itself a standardized curriculum.
