## Rationale and Objectives

To compare adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms for reduced-dose computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

Forty-four young oncology patients (mean age 30 ± 9 years) were included. After routine thoraco-abdominal CT (dose 100%, average CTDI  vol 9.1 ± 2.4 mGy, range 4.4–16.9 mGy), follow-up CT was acquired at 50% (average CTDI  vol 4.5 ± 1.2 mGy, range 2.2–8.4 mGy) in 29 patients additionally at 20% dose (average CTDI  vol 1.9 ± 0.5 mGy, range 0.9–3.4 mGy). Each reduced-dose CT was reconstructed using both ASIR and MBIR. Four radiologists (two juniors and two seniors) blinded to dose and technique read each set of CT images regarding objective and subjective image qualities (high- or low-contrast structures), subjective noise or pixilated appearance, diagnostic confidence, and lesion detection.

## Results

At all dose levels, objective image noise was significantly lower with MBIR than with ASIR ( _P_ < 0.001). The subjective image quality for low-contrast structures was significantly higher with MBIR than with ASIR ( _P_ < 0.001).

Reduced-dose abdominal CT images of patients with higher body mass index (BMI) were read with significantly higher diagnostic confidence than images of slimmer patients ( _P_ < 0.001) and had higher subjective image quality, regardless of technique.

Although MBIR images appeared significantly more pixilated than ASIR images, they were read with higher diagnostic confidence, especially by juniors ( _P_ < 0.001).

## Conclusions

Reduced-dose CT during the follow-up of young oncology patients should be reconstructed with MBIR to ensure diagnostic quality. Elevated body mass index does not hamper the quality of reduced-dose CT.
