## Rationale and Objectives

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is associated with an increased risk of cardiac death. The present study evaluates whether using computed tomographic (CT)–derived criteria for normal myocardial mass can improve detection of LVH on CT angiography (CTA).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 2238 subjects (63 ± 9 years, 27% female) who underwent CTA were studied. To identify normal limits for CT-derived myocardial mass, we studied normal subjects (those without diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or coronary artery disease). Left ventricular mass (LVM) was measured manually using two different workstations. The CT criteria of LVH was defined as LVM above the 97th percentile per gender and compared to echocardiographic criteria (110 g/m  2 in women; 124 g/m  2 in men), and specificity and sensitivity of both models to detect LVH were calculated.

## Results

The LVM was higher in men than women in normal cohorts (75.5 ± 14.0 vs. 63.1 ± 12.8 g/m  2 , _P_ = .001 with electron beam CTA and 78.5 ± 11.9 vs. 65.0 ± 9.2 g/m  2 , _P_ = .001 with 64 multidetector \[MD\] CT, respectively). The coefficient of variation between electron beam CTA and 64 MDCT for measuring LVM was 3.1%. Comparing the new CTA/64 MDCT criteria of LVH (103.0 g/m  2 in men; 89.0 g/m  2 in women) to the previous echocardiographic criteria of LVH, the specificity in women and men decreased from 100% in both genders by echocardiography to 91.8% and 92.6%, respectively, but the sensitivity increased from 42.0% to 100% and from 41.1% to 100%.

## Conclusion

This study suggests that CT-measured LVM has low variability and normal values based on CT criteria will potentially increase the early detection of LVH.

Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the earliest manifestation of cardiac damage in hypertension , and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events . The detection and quantification of LVH is an important target to monitor the efficacy of antihypertensive therapies . Two-dimensional echocardiography has been used to measure left ventricular mass (LVM) for the past two decades , but because of significant improvement in measuring techniques, other modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , computed tomography (CT) , multiple detector row CT (MDCT) , and three-dimensional echocardiography have been accepted as alternatives for accurate LVH measurement. Electron beam (EB) computed tomographic angiographic (CTA) and 64 MDCT with high spatial resolution can accurately differentiate the endocardial and epicardial boundaries and provide detailed information of cardiac structures that should allow for precise measurement of the chamber volume and LVM without assumptions regarding geometry . Studies have used various criteria to measure LVH with different imaging modalities , but previous CT-defined criteria are still challenging and have a very low sensitivity to detect LVH . The present study evaluates whether a new criteria for LVH on CTA/MDCT can improve detection of LVH.

## Methods

## Study Population

We enrolled consecutive patients without known causes of increased LVM to define the normal and 97th percentiles for both men and women from among 2238 consecutive subjects (mean 63 ± 9 years, 27% women) who underwent CTA with EB and 458 subjects who underwent 64 MDCT. Excluded were those patients with known coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure or ejection fraction <50%, hypertension, or diabetes. The study protocol was approved by the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA.

The red and blue lines represent traced endocardial and epicardial boundaries, respectively. The papillary muscle was excluded from measures. The LV cavity volume, total LV volume (myocardial + cavity) was measured. LV mass (G) was calculated by this formula: 1.05 g/mL × (total LVV − LV cavity volume). The slice thickness is 1.5 or 3 mm. A total of 6–10 slices need be traced in each study. The other slices that were not manually traced are automatically completed by computer.
