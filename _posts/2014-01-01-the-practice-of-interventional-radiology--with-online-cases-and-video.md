This is a first edition text based partly on Karim Valji's excellent _Vascular and Interventional Radiology_ , last published in 2006. The new title brings greatly expanded sections on bread-and-butter procedures as well as completely new sections on neurointerventions and interventional oncology. New images and redone illustrations are also part of the new book. As is the case with many textbooks today, online cases and videos as well as the complete text online are included. Interventional radiology fellows and senior residents would likely benefit most from this book, particularly as a reference. Junior residents learning the basics may find the text overwhelming and esoteric, especially when trying to survive a first rotation. Useful clinical guidelines and current patient management is included, which should be of interest to established interventionalists. A wide range of topics is covered, making this a good reference for any practitioner. There is a heavy reliance on explanatory text and some of the tables and quick reference diagrams could be more useful, especially in the early chapters where they consist of short lists such as “sources of arterial emboli”; these are minor concerns in an otherwise exceptional book.

Instead of a cookbook-style text of bullet point rules and steps, there is acknowledgement of evolving data and varying practice patterns with discussions. Those looking for a handbook should look elsewhere. The text is geared toward practice rather than radiology residency boards review with in-depth clinically relevant discussions. Residents will find the 100+ online cases as useful as they are basic, relevant, to the point, and high yield. The online videos are similarly targeted, with most of the content on basic techniques, although several complex cases are also shown.

The general format for each chapter is straightforward, with subsections for anatomy (including development and variants), imaging findings, diseases, and interventions. There is no strict adherence to this format and some chapters have more or less content for each subsection, usually in a commonsense manner, and most include additional subsections when needed. For example, the pelvic and lower extremity arteries chapter expands on clinical aspects of peripheral artery disease, Doppler waveforms and other imaging, medical therapy regimens, techniques with detailed results and complications, and a large section detailing the TransAtlantic Inter-Society Consensus peripheral artery disease lesion categories and guidelines. Similarly, the hemodialysis section is anchored with a discussion of National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. The oncology section opens with an assessment of the various hepatocellular carcinoma staging systems and their clinical relevance, whereas Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and Karnovsky Performance Status Score are included for proper patient selection.

The techniques are described in a useful manner with practical “tips and tricks,” such as methods for reaching inaccessible lesions with computed tomography guidance, pearls for difficult transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, and guidance for foreign body retrieval. Patient selection, device selection, preprocedure care, and postprocedure care are provided where necessary.

Kaufman's _Requisites_ tackles similar content and a comparison is apt. This text is focused on general interventional radiology practice today, whereas _Requisites_ seems geared toward board study and basic knowledge. For example, _Requisites_ has excellent anatomic information and sections on breast and musculoskeletal interventions but little oncology. Valji's text has more and higher quality radiologic images, expansive clinical guidance, more current content, and no breast or musculoskeletal sections. An interventional radiology fellow or senior resident on his or her way to an interventional radiology fellowship would find this book an excellent companion to a handbook-style quick reference.
