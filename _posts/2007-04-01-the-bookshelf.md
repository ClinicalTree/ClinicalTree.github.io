This third edition of _Fundamentals of Body CT_ by Webb, Brant, and Major has been released nearly 10 years after the second edition first primed residents for (CT) rotations in chest, abdomen, and musculoskeletal regions. Divided into three main sections—thorax, abdomen/pelvis, and musculoskeletal—this text provides an easy-to-follow approach to CT, discussing the highest yield diagnoses made by CT examination. Best suited for first-year radiology residents on their introductory CT rotations, the authors begin each section with a terse discussion of the relevant anatomy. A separate chapter within each section discusses CT technique and general principles; the authors have updated the text to include multidetector CT and new contrast agents. A very useful discussion of CT protocoling is also included for the first-year resident.

The sections are organized by organ system and major pathologic categories. The text is very high-yield, and only major categories of disease are covered. The authors superficially dissect each process and discuss pertinent differential considerations with radiographic CT findings. This text does not intend to provide an exhaustive review of the clinical pathophysiology of each disease process; instead, a cursory discussion is initially detailed with a more comprehensive review of the actual CT findings composing a bulk of the text. For example, the authors begin the pleura section by discussing common causes of exudates and transudates. A small table features the relevant clinical findings, and two short paragraphs discuss the clinical background of each process. The authors then focus on CT differentiation of an empyema versus lung abscess, meticulously describing unique identifying CT features such as shape, attenuation, angles of margin, and so on; 10 stunning CT images and 2 diagrammatic representations accompany and highlight this particular discussion. Again, advancements in CT, such as virtual colonoscopy and 3D imaging, are discussed in collaboration with clinically relevant supplements such as colorectal staging. In contradistinction to older versions of this text, images are reproduced flawlessly, with arrow markers highlighting the more subtle findings. A bullet point review of the text is often provided at the end of each section for quick review.

This text does not provide a review of basic science CT physics, though discussion of clinically relevant physics is occasionally undertaken.

In summary, this text is a phenomenal companion for the first-year resident during his or her introductory CT rotations. Each section could easily be read within a few days before beginning a rotation and would provide a quick reference review for older residents, though not nearly sufficient oral or written board review.
