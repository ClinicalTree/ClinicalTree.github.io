## Rationale and Objectives

Hyperthyroidism leads to an enhanced demand for glucose. The hypothesis of the study is that 2-\[fluorine-18\]fluoro-2-deoxy-  d -glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) can demonstrate the alteration of systemic glucose metabolism in hyperthyroidism patients by measuring the FDG standard uptake value (SUV) in liver and skeletal muscle.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-eight active hyperthyroidism patients and 30 control participants were recruited for the study. The intensity of FDG uptake in the liver and thigh muscles was graded subjectively, comprising three groups: group I, higher FDG uptake in the liver; group II, equal FDG uptake in the liver and muscles; and group III, higher FDG uptake in the muscles. Ten subjects with FDG PET scans at hyperthyroid and euthyroid status were analyzed. Serum levels of thyroxine (T  4 ) and triiodothyronine (T  3 ) correlated to the SUVs of the liver and muscles.

## Results

Forty-one patients (41/48, 85.4%) showed symmetrically increased FDG uptake in the muscles (22 in group I, 9 in group II, and 17 in group III). Group I patients were significantly older than group II ( _P_ = .02) and group III ( _P_ = .001) patients. The correlation coefficient between the serum T  3 , T  4 , and SUV levels in the muscles was significant ( _r_ = 0.47–0.77, _P_ < .01), particularly in liver and muscle FDG uptake between hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. In the 30 control subjects, there was normal physiological FDG uptake in the liver and muscles.

## Conclusion

In PET scans showing a pattern of decreased liver and increased skeletal muscle FDG uptake in hyperthyroidism patients, this change of FDG distribution is correspondence to the severity of hyperthyroidism status.

The thyroid hormone plays a critical role in temperature homeostasis, thereby influencing the rate of metabolism and energy expenditure . The enhancement of the metabolic rate in target tissues is accompanied by an increase in whole-body glucose utilization . During thyrotoxicosis, skeletal muscles increase glucose utilization in response to an increase in oxidative and nonoxidative metabolic pathways in humans . The liver plays a dominant role in the preservation of glucose homeostasis. Compared with euthyroid subjects, patients with hyperthyroidism have a 90% increase in fasting hepatic glucose production .

2-deoxy-2-\[F-18\]fluoro-  d -glucose (FDG) is a glucose analog that is taken up by cell membrane glucose transport and then phosphorylated by hexokinase in the cytoplasm. Positron emission tomography (PET) with FDG is a whole-body imaging technique that exploits the increased glycolysis in tissue cells to detect disease. In an FDG PET cancer screening program resulting from body weight loss, it has been reported that incidental findings of symmetrically increased skeletal muscle and thymus FDG uptake is a clue for the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism .

The FDG PET scan at the hyperthyroid state revealed increased FDG uptake in the thyroid, the thymus, and the skeletal muscles, especially the psoas muscle (a′) . The FDG activity intensity of the skeletal muscles was higher than that of the liver, representing a group III image. At hyperthyroidism status, the thyroid function test showed serum thyrotropin level <0.1 miU/mL (normal 0.4–5.0 miU/mL); T 3 , 264.6 ng/dL (normal 80–180 ng/dL); and T 4 , 15.3 μg/dL (normal 4.5–12 μg/dL).
