This article examines certain critical aspects relating to the clinical competency of professionalism. A discussion is presented which is centered on an analysis of two fictional scenarios explored from the standpoint of a current and a former program director, an associate dean, a department chair, and a lawyer. These cases are followed by a series of questions and a legal discussion which can then be used for either individual study or group discussion.

_Professionalism_ is limited not only to the interaction of physicians and patients, but also involves the interactions between other physicians and the health care team. As professionals, we are character “mentors” to our residents and peers. We learn from those around us and we pass this learning (“good” or “bad”) onto others.

Furthermore, medicine can only succeed as a respected position in society by maintaining and bolstering public confidence and respect for our profession. With that said, part of our “professional duty” is to deal with the “unprofessional” behavior, that behavior that can erode the work environment and taint society’s view of medicine.

This article is meant to stimulate action in dealing with the problem physician, “a disruptive professional.” Two fictional scenarios are presented to focus on the clinical competency of professionalism, specifically sexual harassment and the underperforming resident physician (the following case scenarios are based in part on a panel discussion held at the Annual Meeting of the Association of University Radiologists on April 28, 2007 in Denver, Colorado). These discussions propose several options on how to approach and deal with the particular problems raised by each scenario.

These case studies, their associated questions, and legal discussion are suitable for both an individual or group study.

## Scenario 1. The friend

A married male program director is attracted to a new, first-year single female resident. Over the next several months, a relationship develops which is observed by both fellow residents and faculty. The program director leaves his wife and children, and the other residents start to express a concern that this first-year resident is receiving “preferential treatment.”
