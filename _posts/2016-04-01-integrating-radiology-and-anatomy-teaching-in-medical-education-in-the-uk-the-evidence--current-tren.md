This review article presents the current evidence of the importance of integrating radiology and anatomy in medical education in the UK, a recommendation by a number of key anatomy, education, and radiology organizations. Current evidence highlights that on average only 5% of total teaching time in medical education is dedicated to radiology. Often, radiology teaching does not adequately fulfill students' learning needs and potentially leaves them underprepared for medical practice. Benefits of integrating radiology and anatomy include improved clinical application of anatomy, an increase in student's interest in anatomy, and ultimately improved radiological interpretation. Various modalities exist for the integration of radiology and anatomy, facilitated by the vast portability of radiological images. It appears that combining radiological resources with traditional anatomy teaching methodology in a blended approach is most beneficial.

## Introduction

Throughout medical schools around the world, anatomy remains a fundamental part of the curriculum that has traditionally followed a combination of anatomy lectures and dissection. With rapid technological advances, the availability and use of alternative anatomy resources is evolving, resulting in novel ways in which anatomy teaching can be delivered. The use of radiological images is at the cornerstone of this movement because of their availability and undeniable clinical relevance. This is especially so as doctors request more radiological investigations than ever before . In the UK, the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has suggested that this is increasing by an eye-watering 10% per year. This evolving diagnostic culture stresses that universities must ensure that students are adequately prepared for accurate radiological interpretation.

Given that the application of anatomical knowledge is paramount to image interpretation, we intend to review the literature to determine the increasing interest of integrating radiology and anatomy in medical education, and how this is changing our perceptions of traditional anatomy pedagogy.

## Background

Anatomy remains a core aspect of medical education with cadaveric dissection continuing to be the mainstay. Dissection provides students with the opportunity to apply knowledge in a three-dimensional manner, learn key practical skills, and to put professional attitudes into practice . The current expectation is that students have to read a substantial quantity of information before their dissection sessions. Difficulty often arises with students being unable to apply knowledge and grasp the skill of identifying anatomical structures during dissection. This can only have a negative impact on the interpretation of radiological images. Evidence suggests that integrating radiology and anatomy can reinforce learning during anatomical dissection .

## Radiology Curriculum

The importance of developing a formal radiological curriculum is evident throughout the medical literature . Radiology teaching is often sporadic in nature and taught irregularly alongside modules rather than in its own right . In recognition of this, there is “increasing interest for an integrated approach towards radiology education as well as towards the content of an innovative radiology curriculum” .

In the UK, one key document that recommends radiology teaching is the RCR's “Undergraduate Radiology Curriculum” . This gives guidance of a proposed framework of integrating radiology teaching in medical education. The RCR outlines that universities should prepare medical students with the “necessary knowledge and skills to routinely arrange and correctly interpret basic radiological investigations in the context of the individual patient” . Outlined within one of three curricular sections, recognition of normal anatomical structures is a fundamental principle of radiological interpretation. The RCR has also made it clear that radiology image interpretation is central to ensure accurate patient management. Furthermore, it suggests that radiology images offer a powerful tool in supporting the learning process of anatomy and pathology, as well as in improving the understanding of disease and treatment response .
