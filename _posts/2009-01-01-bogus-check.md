When I slit open the envelope, I noticed that it had no return address. When I pulled it open, a check fell out. It was made out to me in the amount of $4975. So I looked at the attached letter. My name was not on it. But it began:

“We are pleased to inform you that you are one of the declared winners of the North-American/European Sweepstakes Lottery. A ticket with serial numbers ——— attached to your name drew the lucky winning numbers.

“We have made many unsuccessful attempts to contact you regarding this winning. You are entitled to the sum of $125,000 dollars. This is from total prize money of $9 million that was shared among the other 72 declared winners. Please note that all the participants were selected through a random computer ballot system drawn from over 500,000 names.”

This would have been my luckiest draw since my daughter won a cake at the PTA meeting 35 years ago. The letter continued:

“Your claim number is ——— and in accordance with our disbursement policy your prize award money has been forwarded to our clearing/disbursement institution to release your funds to you either by certified check or money order or wire transfer to your designated local bank account which you will provide.

“To expedite the processing, enclosed is the check for $4975 which has been deducted from your winning. You will be using some money on this first check to pay for the applicable taxes on your winning. The tax amount is $3895 to be paid by MONEYGRAM.
