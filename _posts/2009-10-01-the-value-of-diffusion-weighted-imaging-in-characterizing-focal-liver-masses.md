## Rationale and Objectives

To determine if focal liver masses could be differentiated as benign or malignant on the basis of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

## Methods and Materials

A total of 104 patients with focal liver masses were scanned using 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DWI was performed with b values of 0, 50, and 400 s/mm  2 . Of these, 76 patients had lesions larger than 2 cm diameter, radiologic or pathologic characterization of the lesion, and diagnostic quality DWI. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the largest liver lesion was measured. The liver masses were diagnosed on histology or had characteristic computed tomography/MRI findings and follow up of more than 6 months. The analyzed lesions were hemangioma ( _n_ = 17), cysts ( _n_ = 5), hepatocellular cancer (HCC) ( _n_ = 41), adenoma ( _n_ = 3), focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) ( _n_ = 6), and metastases ( _n_ = 4).

## Results

The mean (standard deviation) ADC values (10  −5 mm  2 /second) of hemangiomas, cysts, FNH, and HCC were 156.8 (54.1), 190.2 (43.0), 130.1 (81.9), and 107.6 (32.7). The ADC of cysts and hemangiomas were significantly higher than that of other lesions ( _P_ = .0003, _t_ -test). There was no significant difference between ADC values of solid, benign liver lesions (FNH, adenoma) and malignant lesions (HCC, metastases) ( _P_ = .62).

## Conclusion

Solid liver lesions have a lower ADC than cysts and hemangiomas. However, there is no significant difference in ADC between solid benign and malignant lesions. DWI appears to have only minimal additional value over currently used MRI sequences in characterizing liver masses.

With the increasing use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), incidental liver lesions are increasingly identified. Even in patients undergoing staging for known malignancy, liver lesions may be identified that cannot be characterized with reasonable certainty. The ability to definitely diagnose liver lesions has many clinical benefits, including obviating the need for invasive techniques such as biopsy or resection surgery. An indeterminate diagnosis often requires follow-up imaging in several months, and may result in considerable anxiety to the patient and cost to the health system. In the last few years, progress has been made in imaging characterization of liver lesions. Delayed scanning with gadobenate dimeglumine (MultiHance, Bracco Diagnostics, Princeton, NJ) has been reported to help in differentiating focal nodular hyperplasia from other hypervascular lesions, including hepatic adenomas . Studies have indicated the usefulness of MRI studies performed using protocols involving two contrast agents, superparamagnetic iron oxide particles and conventional gadolinium, in improving accuracy for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients . Microbubble-enhanced sonography is being evaluated for its use in characterizing liver lesions .

Diffusion is the random, thermally induced movement of water molecules. Diffusion of intracellular water molecules is reduced due to the presence of the membranes that encase the cell and its organelles. Conversely, diffusion is less restricted in the normal extracellular space. In general, malignant lesions are more cellular than benign lesions. Therefore, diffusion would be expected to be lower in malignant than in benign lesions, and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) potentially may be a robust method for differentiating malignant and benign lesions. In this study, we investigated whether DWI can help differentiate benign from malignant liver lesions.
