## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of educating radiology residents and radiographers about radiation exposure on reduction of dose area product (DAP) and fluoroscopy time in diagnostic fluoroscopy of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in adult patients.

## Materials and Methods

In April 2015, we offered 1 hour of education to radiology residents and radiographers on how to reduce radiation doses during fluoroscopic examinations. Fluoroscopic examinations of the GI tracts of adult patients performed from June 2014 to February 2016 were evaluated. A total of 2326 fluoroscopic examinations (779 and 1547 examinations before and after education, respectively) were performed, including 10 kinds of examinations. Fluoroscopy time and DAP were collected. A radiologist evaluated the number of spot images, captured images, cine video, captured video, and the use of collimation or magnification. We used the Mann-Whitney _U_ test to assess the difference in fluoroscopy-related factors before and after education.

## Results

Median DAP decreased significantly after education, from 21.1 to 18.2 Gy∙cm  2 ( _P_ < .001) in all examinations. After education DAP decreased significantly in defecography ( _P_ < .001) and fluoroscopy time decreased significantly in upper gastrointestinal series with water-soluble contrast ( _P_ < .001). Spot and cine images that increased the radiation dose were used less frequently after education than before in some kinds of examinations, especially in defecography ( _P_ < .001). More images were collimated after education in barium swallow than before ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

Educating radiologist residents and radiographers could reduce DAP in fluoroscopy examinations of the GI tract in adult patients.

## Introduction

Radiation exposure from medical examinations has been increasing consistently . Although computed tomography is regarded as an important source of radiation, fluoroscopy should also be considered . Fluoroscopy is still used for functional evaluations, but radiation exposure from fluoroscopy is often neglected . Many studies have focused on radiation exposure from fluoroscopy in children, but few studies have paid attention to radiation exposure in adults . Fluoroscopy examinations of adult patients should also follow the as-low-as-reasonably-achievable principle to decrease radiation exposure.

A noticeable feature of fluoroscopy examination is that radiation exposure can depend on who performs the examination . The protocols for fluoroscopy examinations can be flexible depending on the circumstances of each examination, including patient condition, anatomical variants, and the purpose of the examination. Because radiologists and nonradiologist physicians operate fluoroscopy machines regardless of their experience or knowledge about radiation protection and reduction exposure during fluoroscopy, less experienced trainees and radiographers may not have optimal fluoroscopic technique which could therefore lead to increased radiation dose. Radiographers' awareness of radiation is also important as they assist during fluoroscopic examinations carried out according to nonradiologists' instructions. Different levels of knowledge about radiation have been reported among medical staff from different professions and workplaces, as well as among doctors with different specialties, positions, and experience .
