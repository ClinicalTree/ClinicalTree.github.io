## Rationale and Objectives

Recent changes in radiology curriculum and access to residency program information, including the introduction of various online resources and the Interventional Radiology integrated pathway, may influence the rank list order of medical student applicants. The purpose of this study is to assess factors that affect the rank lists of medical students applying to our radiology residency program in the 2016-2017 academic year.

## Materials and Methods

After IRB approval, an anonymous online 19 question survey was emailed to 622 applicants to our diagnostic radiology and/or interventional radiology integrated pathway. Applicants ranked 35 unique factors that may influence their residency rank list order from 1 (not important at all) to 5 (very important), listed their top five ‘very important’ factors, and ranked various sources of information used to learn about residency programs. General applicant demographic questions were also included.

## Results

Response rate was 18.8% (117/622). The 5 most important factors affecting applicant ranking of programs are perceived happiness of the residents and faculty (4.69), fellowship and job placement of recent graduates (4.34), interactions with programs' current residents (4.33), stability of the department and program (4.29), and geographic location of the program (4.27). The top 5 resources for learning about residency programs were interactions with current residents at the program (4.47), program director (3.87), and interviewing faculty (3.87). Individual program websites were ranked more highly than internet message boards and forums as an information source.

## Conclusion

Medical students consider a large number of factors and resources in determining their rank lists, with factors encountered during the interview day playing a significant role in shaping the applicants' view of a residency program.

## INTRODUCTION

Every year, medical students devote significant time and energy organizing their radiology residency rank lists for the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). The factors that play an important role in determining the rank list order are diverse and often outside the control of the residency programs ( ). While candidate selection criteria used by residency program directors are often objective in nature (e.g. class ranking and test scores), medical students often base their rank list order on more subjective criteria ( ). Although the overall candidate interview and matching process has remained essentially unchanged since a 2002 study of rank list factors by Pretorius and Hrung, the interval emergence of online educational resources, digital devices, and web-based information may influence how candidates receive information about various residency programs and how they choose to rank them ( ). In addition, the introduction of the interventional radiology integrated (diagnostic radiology/interventional radiology \[DR/IR\]) pathway by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education in 2013 ( ) is an important change in training paradigm, potentially attracting an applicant pool that values different factors than those applying for the diagnostic radiology (DR) pathway. Though there are recent publications that have described the results of the first integrated DR/IR residency match ( ) as well as evaluate the impact of social media and internet resources on residency training ( ), there are no recent studies that attempt to comprehensively evaluate the importance of various factors and resources in determining radiology residency rank list order in different subsets of applicants, particularly those applying for the DR/IR pathway.

The purpose of this study is to assess the different resources applicants use to learn about residency programs and determine which factors students value most highly when ranking radiology residency programs.
