## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of reduced tube current (dose) on lung nodule detection in pediatric multidetector array computed tomography (MDCT).

## Materials and Methods

The study included normal clinical chest MDCT images of 13 patients (aged 1–7 years) scanned at tube currents of 70 to 180 mA. Calibrated noise addition software was used to simulate cases as they would have been acquired at 70 mA (the lowest original tube current), 35 mA (50% reduction), and 17.5 mA (75% reduction). Using a validated nodule simulation technique, small lung nodules of 3 to 5 mm in diameter were inserted into the cases, which were then randomized and rated independently by three experienced pediatric radiologists for nodule presence on a continuous scale ranging from zero (definitely absent) to 100 (definitely present). The observer data were analyzed to assess the influence of dose on detection accuracy using the Dorfman-Berbaum-Mets method for multiobserver, multitreatment receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and the Williams trend test.

## Results

The areas under the ROC curves were 0.95, 0.91, and 0.92 at 70, 35, and 17.5 mA, respectively, with standard errors of 0.02 and interobserver variability of 0.02. The Dorfman-Berbaum-Mets method and the Williams trend test yielded _P_ values for the effect of dose of .09 and .05, respectively.

## Conclusion

Tube current (dose) has a weak effect on the detection accuracy of small lung nodules in pediatric MDCT. The effect on detection accuracy of a 75% dose reduction was comparable to interobserver variability, suggesting a potential for dose reduction.

Because of the superior resolution of modern multidetector array computed tomography (MDCT), chest computed tomography (CT) examination for the detection of lung nodules is often standard for pediatric cancer staging and surveillance. In such examinations, the presence of even one small lung nodule may have tremendous prognostic and therapeutic implications . However, chest CT involves the irradiation of many radiosensitive organs, including the thyroids, lungs, breasts, stomach, esophagus, and bone marrow; these organs are at risk for radiation-induced cancer later in life . Therefore, reducing radiation dose from chest CT is an important area of investigation .

Several previous studies on the pediatric population have suggested that diagnostic-quality images of the lung could be obtained at significantly reduced tube currents. However, those studies were preference based; images at reduced tube currents were evaluated by assigning subjective image quality scores to known anatomic structures. The results of such studies do not necessarily reflect the actual performance of radiologists in terms of lung nodule detection at reduced tube currents. Performance-based evaluations have been hindered by two major challenges: (1) the low occurrence of isolated small lung nodules in the pediatric population makes it difficult to research with real lung nodules, and (2) ethical concerns prohibit repeated scans to be performed on the same patients at different tube currents.

To enlarge the scale of our study, three copies of each case were made to create a total of 117 series (13 patients × 3 dose levels × 3 copies) to serve as background for nodule simulation.

In the above equations, σ  real and σ  sim are the real and simulated noise magnitude, mA  real and mA  sim are the real and simulated tube currents, and _d_ is phantom diameter. Coefficients α _i_ and β _i_ ( _i_ = 0, 1,…, 5) extracted from the fits were then used to calculate the nominal simulation tube current that provided the same noise magnitude as that at the desired actual tube current or, conversely, to calculate the actual tube current that was represented by a nominal simulation tube current inputted to the noise tool. After tube current calibration, the accuracy of the simulated noise magnitude was reevaluated.
