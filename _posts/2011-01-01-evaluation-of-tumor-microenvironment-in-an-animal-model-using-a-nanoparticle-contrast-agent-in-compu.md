## Rationale and Objectives

Non-invasive longitudinal imaging of tumor vasculature could provide new insights into the development of solid tumors, facilitating efficient delivery of therapeutics. In this study, we report three-dimensional imaging and characterization of tumor vascular architecture using a nanoparticle contrast agent and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) imaging.

## Materials and Methods

Five Balb/c mice implanted with 4T1/Luc syngeneic breast tumors cells were used for the study. The nanoparticle contrast agent was systemically administered and longitudinal CT imaging was performed pre-contrast and at serial time points post-contrast, for up to 7 days for studying the characteristics of tumor-associated blood vessels. Gene expression of tumor angiogenic biomarkers was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.

## Results

Early-phase imaging demonstrated the presence of co-opted and newly developed tumor vessels. The co-opted vessels demonstrated wall-permeability and “leakiness” characteristics evident by an increase in extravascular nanoparticle-based signal enhancement visible well beyond the margins of tumor. Diameters of tumor-associated vessels were larger than the contralateral normal vessels. Delayed-phase imaging also demonstrated significant accumulation of nanoparticle contrast agent both within and in areas surrounding the tumor. A heterogeneous pattern of signal enhancement was observed both within and among individual tumors. Gene-expression profiling demonstrated significant variability in several angiogenic biomarkers both within and among individual tumors.

## Conclusions

The nanoparticle contrast agent and high-resolution CT imaging facilitated visualization of co-opted and newly developed tumors vessels as well as imaging of nanoparticle accumulation within tumors. The use of this agent could provide novel insights into tumor vascular biology and could have implications on the monitoring of tumor status.

Solid tumors undergo significant changes in their architecture during growth and development. Angiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is one of the hallmarks of growing tumors . The tumor blood vessels show distinctly different patterns compared to blood vessels found in normal tissues . The presence of large pores in the endothelial lining of the vessels and the absence of continuous pericyte and smooth muscle cell coverage are two of the commonly observed traits of “leaky” tumor blood vessels . These abnormalities in tumor vessels often lead to significant changes in the transport processes within the tumor interstitial space, affecting the delivery of nutrients and therapeutics . Rapidly growing tumors also represent a large source of growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (eg, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2), which are then systemically distributed . The increased levels of growth factors and their receptors are known to have implications for blood vessel permeability, rapid proliferation, and the growth and metastatic potential of tumors. Furthermore, although tumors of different origin are expected (and known) to demonstrate marked variability in tumor-architecture and biomarker levels, inter- and intratumor heterogeneity has been observed even within the same tumor type . This heterogeneity could have significant implications in personalized tumor treatment.

Non-invasive monitoring of tumor architecture coupled with gene-expression profiling could therefore enhance our understanding of growing tumors and its interactions with the surrounding host tissue. Dynamic and longitudinal imaging could also provide insights into the functional characteristics of these tumor blood vessels. One methodology that has been used in preclinical models of solid tumors is noninvasive micro–computed tomography (CT) imaging . The three-dimensional nature of the technique combined with high spatial resolution provides excellent assessment of tumors. The linear relationship between image signal enhancement and contrast agent concentration enables accurate quantitative assessment of tumor vasculature and its micro-environment. However the pre-clinical utility of CT imaging for investigating tumor vasculature has been limited because of two major limitations of conventional contrast agents: their rapid systemic clearance from the blood pool and low vessel conspicuity from high propensity to rapidly extravasate into the tumor extravascular space. In this work, we evaluated the tumor micro-environment using a nanoparticle contrast agent and CT imaging. Specifically, we investigated whether a long circulating blood-pool nanoparticle CT contrast agent can enable 1) visualization of tumor vasculature and 2) demonstration of tumor vessel “leakiness” by imaging nanoparticle extravasation into the tumor interstitial space. Early phase imaging was performed to investigate the feasibility of tumor vascular imaging. Longitudinal delayed-phase imaging was performed to study tumor vessel permeability as well as the transport and accumulation of nanoparticles in tumors. These studies were performed during the National Cancer Institute–sponsored Cancer Imaging Summer Camp, held at Washington University, St. Louis, in June 2009.

Two types of vessel were analyzed based on their origin. For tumors vessels that originated from inferior vena cava, size analysis was performed for vessel segments surrounding the tumor tissue. Identical contralateral normal vessels were used for comparison. For co-opted vessel originating from the jugular vein, size analysis was performed for vessel segments in the thoraco-abdominal region. Identical contralateral normal vessels were used for comparison. In most animals, the contralateral vessels originating from the jugular vein was not clearly demonstrated below the abdominal region. Values are reported as mean and standard deviation with three to five measurements per vessel.

Coronal three-dimensional volume-rendered images demonstrating the extravasation and accumulation of nanoparticle contrast agent within the tumor ( yellow arrow ). Immediately after administering the nanoparticle contrast agent, the overall body and tumor vasculature is nicely demonstrated. Tumor accumulation of nanoparticle contrast agent was observed as early as 24 hours. No image-detectable nanoparticle contrast agent signal was observed from the blood-pool at post-120 hours (day 5) as confirmed by the absence of any vessels or heart signal on post-120 hour image. However, the tumor is clearly enhanced. The only other organs enhanced are the liver and spleen, which are the organs for nanoparticle contrast agent clearance.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EvaluationofTumorMicroenvironmentinanAnimalModelusingaNanoparticleContrastAgentinComputedTomographyImaging/5_1s20S1076633210005088.jpg)
