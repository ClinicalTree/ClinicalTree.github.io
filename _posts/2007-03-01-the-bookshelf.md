Thieme’s _The Chest X-Ray, Differential Diagnosis in Conventional Radiology_ , offers a methodical, pattern-based system for reviewing chest radiographs that would be immensely useful for medical students and beginner residents. The book is divided into 10 major chapters, each approximately 30 pages in length.

The first three chapters focus on anatomic landmarks and the normal radiograph appearance. There is an abundance of plain radiographs with diagrammatic anatomic correlates. There is a short segment of text at the beginning of each chapter that discusses major concepts in pathophysiology pertinent to the interpretation. Numerous tables list a variety of differential diagnoses that introduce the reader to disease processes covered in subsequent chapters.

The last seven chapters focus on specific findings (ie, hyperlucent lung, interstitial lung disease) and detail the numerous disease processes that can contribute to a radiographic appearance. Once again, there are a few short paragraphs of text followed by a plethora of high-quality images and tables.

Image quality is adequate, though fine detail and subtle findings are difficult to see in the reproductions.

In summary, this text provides a cogent review of the interpretation of a chest radiograph. It is most suited for medical students and beginner residents. A radiology resident would need a secondary book choice to supplement the text within this book.
