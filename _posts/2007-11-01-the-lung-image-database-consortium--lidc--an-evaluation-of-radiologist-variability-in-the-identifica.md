## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to analyze the variability of experienced thoracic radiologists in the identification of lung nodules on computed tomography (CT) scans and thereby to investigate variability in the establishment of the “truth” against which nodule-based studies are measured.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty CT scans were reviewed twice by four thoracic radiologists through a two-phase image annotation process. During the initial “blinded read” phase, radiologists independently marked lesions they identified as “nodule ≥3 mm (diameter),” “nodule <3 mm,” or “non-nodule ≥3 mm.” During the subsequent “unblinded read” phase, the blinded read results of all four radiologists were revealed to each radiologist, who then independently reviewed their marks along with the anonymous marks of their colleagues; a radiologist’s own marks then could be deleted, added, or left unchanged. This approach was developed to identify, as completely as possible, all nodules in a scan without requiring forced consensus.

## Results

After the initial blinded read phase, 71 lesions received “nodule ≥3 mm” marks from at least one radiologist; however, all four radiologists assigned such marks to only 24 (33.8%) of these lesions. After the unblinded reads, a total of 59 lesions were marked as “nodule ≥3 mm” by at least one radiologist. Twenty-seven (45.8%) of these lesions received such marks from all four radiologists, three (5.1%) were identified as such by three radiologists, 12 (20.3%) were identified by two radiologists, and 17 (28.8%) were identified by only a single radiologist.

## Conclusion

The two-phase image annotation process yields improved agreement among radiologists in the interpretation of nodules ≥3 mm. Nevertheless, substantial variabilty remains across radiologists in the task of lung nodule identification.

Both the interest in and demand for computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods for a variety of radiologic tasks involving lung nodules and computed tomography (CT) scans have been rapidly accelerating. CAD for thoracic CT is no longer in its infancy. The field has matured to the point that regulatory approval is now a practical consideration, and clinical radiologists faced with the task of both identifying and characterizing lung nodules on large, multidetector row CT datasets recognize the need for computerized assistance ( ). As more investigators seek to contribute to this expanding field, a common constraint has become evident—limited access to well-characterized image data.

Recognizing that the development of CAD methods by the medical imaging research community would be facilitated and stimulated through access to a well-characterized repository of CT scans, the National Cancer Institute formed the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) ( ). The publicly accessible database of CT scans and corresponding “truth” being created by the LIDC is expected to hasten advancement of lung nodule CAD research by 1) providing clinical images to investigators who might not have access to patient images and 2) allowing for a direct comparison of CAD methods reported in the literature by eliminating database composition as a source of variability in system performance ( ).

Each of the five sites contributed six scans (for a total of 30 scans), and the LIDC radiologist at each site did not read scans from their own institution; accordingly, the total number of lesions in scans read by each radiologist was different.

For scans reviewed by each radiologist, the table tracks individual lesions marked by at least one of the four radiologists who reviewed that scan during the blinded or unblinded reads. These lesions are recorded by the lesion category, if any, to which the lesion was assigned during the two reading sessions of the specified radiologist. The numbers in parentheses convert the numbers of lesions to percentages based on all identified lesions in the scans reviewed by the radiologist.


Table 3


Number of Lesions (Across Radiologists) for Which Changes in Lesion Category Occurred Between the Blinded and Unblinded Reads of a Particular Radiologist


Blinded-to-Unblinded Lesion Category Change Number of Radiologist-Lesions Nodule → micronodule 8 Nodule → non-nodule 9 Nodule → no mark 4 Micronodule → non-nodule 9 Micronodule → no mark 30 Non-nodule → no mark 41 micronodule → nodule 4 Non-nodule → nodule 1 Non-nodule → micronodule 5 No mark → nodule 10 No mark → micronodule 149 No mark → non-nodule 191

For example, if two radiologists both assigned the category “nodule” to a specific lesion during their respective blinded reads and then both radiologists changed their assigned category for that lesion to “micronodule” during their respective unblinded reads, then this lesion would be counted twice in the first row of the table. The data presented in this table were extracted from  Table 2  .

Note that because each case was reviewed by four of the five LIDC radiologists, different subsets of cases were reviewed by different groupings of four radiologists so that no two radiologists reviewed the same subset of cases; therefore, the total number of lesions is not the same across radiologists. The data presented in this table were extracted from  Table 3  . The “no mark” category indicates that a radiologist did not mark a lesion that was marked by at least one other radiologist.
