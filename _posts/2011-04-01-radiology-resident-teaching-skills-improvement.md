## Rationale and Objectives

Teaching is considered an essential competency for residents to achieve during their training. Instruction in teaching skills may assist radiology residents in becoming more effective teachers and increase their overall satisfaction with teaching. The purposes of this study were to survey radiology residents’ teaching experiences during residency and to assess perceived benefits following participation in a teaching skills development course.

## Materials and Methods

Study participants were radiology residents with membership in the American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology or the Siemens AUR Radiology Resident Academic Development Program who participated in a 1.5-hour workshop on teaching skills development at the 2010 Association of University Radiologists meeting. Participants completed a self-administered, precourse questionnaire that addressed their current teaching strategies, as well as the prevalence and structure of teaching skills training opportunities at their institutions. A second postcourse questionnaire enabled residents to evaluate the seminar and assessed new knowledge and skill acquisition.

## Results

Seventy-eight residents completed the precourse and postcourse questionnaires. The vast majority of respondents indicated that they taught medical students (72 of 78 \[92.3%\]). Approximately 20% of residency programs (17 of 78) provided residents with formal didactic programs on teaching skills. Fewer than half (46.8%) of the resident respondents indicated that they received feedback on their teaching from attending physicians (36 of 77), and only 18% (13 of 78) routinely gave feedback to their own learners. All of the course participants agreed or strongly agreed that this workshop was helpful to them as teachers.

## Conclusions

Few residency programs had instituted resident teacher training curricula. A resident teacher training workshop was perceived as beneficial by the residents, and they reported improvement in their teaching skills.

Teaching is considered an essential competency for residents, as well as an accreditation standard by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education . Residents participate in the teaching of medical students and other residents and spend up to one quarter of their work hours teaching, evaluating, or supervising trainees . Although many residents enjoy teaching and consider it to be an important component of their training , many feel inadequately prepared to teach . Formal instruction in effective teaching methods is desired by resident trainees .

The past decade has witnessed an increase in resident-focused workshops geared toward helping residents improve their teaching skills . In 2001, approximately half of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–accredited residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology had established programs for residents to improve their teaching skills . A recent survey of radiology residency programs indicated that fewer than one third of programs offered training programs to enhance the teaching skills of residents . These programs may be challenging to incorporate into residency training for several reasons, including time pressures and a lack of faculty training in medical education . One solution may be to centralize teacher training opportunities by offering workshops at annual radiology meetings with high resident attendance .
