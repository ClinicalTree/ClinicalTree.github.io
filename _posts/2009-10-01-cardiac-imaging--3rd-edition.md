The _Radiology Requisites_ series offers high-yield reviews of a multitude of radiology subspecialties. The third edition of _Cardiac Imaging_ continues in this tradition and in 11 chapters offers a comprehensive overview of the current tools in the cardiac imager's arsenal as well as discussions of major categories of disease affecting the heart and aorta.

The first chapter, “The Elements of Cardiac Imaging,” consists primarily of concise discussions of plain-film analysis of cardiac shape and size, cardiac and pericardial calcifications, and pulmonary vasculature. The subsequent four chapters each focus on modalities commonly used by cardiac imagers: echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, angiography, and computed tomography. Following this modality-specific discussion of cardiac imaging, the remaining chapters cover valvular and ischemic heart disease, coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA), pericardial and myocardial disease, congenital heart disease, and finally thoracic aortic disease.

There have been many technological advances in cardiac imaging since the publication of the second edition in 2005, and the authors have naturally updated the text to reflect these changes. Cardiac computed tomography and coronary CTA are becoming more widespread as acquisition times shorten and resolution, both spatial and temporal, increases. Two new chapters, which include almost 200 images and figures, provide a thorough review of the latest advances in these areas.

The chapter on coronary CTA in particular provides the reader with an excellent introduction and discussion of this exciting technique. Multiple figures supplement the clear and succinct explanation of the underlying technical principles. The current clinical role and indications for the procedure are covered with the caveat that the role of coronary CTA in clinical practice continues to evolve. Another particularly strong section is the chapter on congenital heart disease, which concludes with a useful approach to the differential diagnosis of congenital abnormalities. Anyone seeking to strengthen his or her ability in this area will benefit from the authors' presentation of the five types of pulmonary vascular patterns, ages of presentation, and prevalence of disease.

Although a significant amount of new material has been added, the overall number of pages has remained essentially unchanged. By decreasing the font size slightly, the book has been kept to just over 400 pages. The text is nicely complemented by a large number of high-quality, well-labeled images, many of which are new. In keeping with the style of the _Radiology Requisites_ series, tables and boxes are used liberally to highlight important information in a concise manner. These additions dramatically increase the ease with which material can be reviewed quickly and efficiently.

In summary, this newest edition of _Cardiac Imaging_ is an excellent resource for residents who desire a well-written, up-to-date review of cardiac imaging. Fellows and practicing radiologists will also find much of value, though they will likely want to seek out more thorough discussions of some topics than this book is designed to provide.
