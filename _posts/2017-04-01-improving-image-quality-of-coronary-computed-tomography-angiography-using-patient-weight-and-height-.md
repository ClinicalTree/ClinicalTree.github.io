## Rationale and Objectives

We aim to improve the image quality of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) by using personalized weight and height-dependent scan trigger threshold.

## Materials and Methods

This study was divided into two parts. First, we performed and analyzed the 100 scheduled CCTA data, which were acquired by using body mass index-dependent Smart Prep sequence (trigger threshold ranged from 80 Hu to 250 Hu based on body mass index). By identifying the cases of high quality image, a linear regression equation was established to determine the correlation among the Smart Prep threshold, height, and body weight. Furthermore, a quick search table was generated for weight and height-dependent Smart Prep threshold in CCTA scan. Second, to evaluate the effectiveness of the new individual threshold method, an additional 100 consecutive patients were divided into two groups: individualized group ( _n_ = 50) with weight and height-dependent threshold and control group ( _n_ = 50) with the conventional constant threshold of 150 HU. Image quality was compared between the two groups by measuring the enhancement in coronary artery, aorta, left and right ventricle, and inferior vena cava. By visual inspection, image quality scores were performed to compare between the two groups.

## Results

Regression equation between Smart Prep threshold (K, Hu), height (H, cm), and body weight (BW, kg) was K = 0.811 × H + 1.917 × BW − 99.341. When compared to the control group, the individualized group presented an average overall increase of 12.30% in enhancement in left main coronary artery, 12.94% in proximal right coronary artery, and 10.6% in aorta. Correspondingly, the contrast-to-noise ratios increased by 26.03%, 27.08%, and 23.17%, respectively, and by 633.1% in contrast between aorta and left ventricle. Meanwhile, the individualized group showed an average overall decrease of 22.7% in enhancement of right ventricle and 32.7% in inferior vena cava. There was no significant difference of the image noise between the two groups ( _P_ > .05). By visual inspection, the image quality score of the individualized group was higher than that of the control group.

## Conclusion

Using personalized weight and height-dependent Smart Prep threshold to adjust scan trigger time can significantly improve the image quality of CCTA.

## Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is noninvasive and provides high diagnostic efficacy of detecting cardiovascular diseases (CVD) relative to invasive catheter angiography (ICA) . In recent researches, as a gatekeeper, CCTA presented highly sensitive utility for exclusion of CVD because of its excellent negative predictive value (NPV) . In addition, CCTA, which is convenient and widely used in clinical CVD diagnosis , is associated with cost-effectiveness relative to ICA.

Image quality plays a vital role in CCTA for achieving accurate diagnostic results. In many parameters, the individual's height and weight are important factors affecting the quality of the image in clinical examination . Therefore, different patients may need different scan protocols to achieve optimum image quality.
