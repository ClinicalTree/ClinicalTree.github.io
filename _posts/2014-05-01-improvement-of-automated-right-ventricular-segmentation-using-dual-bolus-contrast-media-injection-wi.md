## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of dual-bolus contrast media injection (dual-CM) on the accuracy of automated right ventricular (RV) segmentation on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).

## Materials and Methods

A total of 104 patients with suspected and known coronary artery disease underwent 256-slice CCTA with retrospective electrocardiographic (ECG) gating. The patients were divided into 51 patients who underwent single-bolus CM injection (single-CM) and 53 patients who underwent dual-CM. The dual-CM method consisted of an initial bolus of CM followed by an injection of dilute CM with saline (CM:saline, 1:9). Three-dimensional CCTA images were automatically segmented into the RV, left ventricle (LV), and myocardium using commercially available software (Comprehensive Cardiac Analysis; Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH). Prevalence and locations of segmentation errors were compared between single-CM and dual-CM. Segmentation errors were defined as segment deviation of >1 cm from the actual ventricular margin.

## Results

Prevalence of segmentation errors was significantly lower with dual-CM than with single-CM in the diastolic phase (4/41 vs. 20/41, respectively; _P_ < .01), and there was no difference between the two methods in the systolic phase (2/12 vs. 2/10, respectively). With dual-CM and single-CM, the locations of segmentation errors were mostly the RV wall (4/53 and 18/51, respectively) and secondly the LV wall (2/53 and 9/51, respectively).

## Conclusions

Dual-CM improved the accuracy of automated ventricular segmentation using diastolic data from 256-slice CCTA.

Since development of 64-slice computed tomography (CT), coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has been used clinically for assessment of coronary artery stenosis . In addition, because definition of large heart structures is accurate with CCTA , CCTA is useful for measurement of right ventricle (RV) volume , left ventricle (LV) volume , and LV mass . Previous studies have demonstrated that ventricular volume measurements provide useful evidence in assessment of various cardiac diseases.

Automated segmentation has been developed for ventricular segmentations of the right atrium, left atrium, RV, LV, and myocardium and can calculate the RV volume, LV volume, and myocardium volume in only about 2.5 minutes .
