## Rationale and Objectives

Radiologists commonly use comparison films to improve their differential diagnosis. Educational literature suggests that this technique might also be used to bolster the process of _learning_ to interpret radiographs. We investigated the effectiveness of three comparison techniques in medical students, whom we invited to compare cases of the same disease (same-disease comparison), cases of different diseases (different-disease comparison), disease images with normal images (disease/normal comparison), and identical images (no comparison/control condition). Furthermore, we used eye-tracking technology to investigate which elements of the two cases were compared by the students.

## Materials and Methods

We randomly assigned 84 medical students to one of four conditions and had them study different diseases on chest radiographs, while their eye movements were being measured. Thereafter, participants took two tests that measured diagnostic performance and their ability to locate diseases, respectively.

## Results

Students studied most efficiently in the same-disease and different-disease comparison conditions: test 1, _F_ (3, 68) = 3.31, _P_ = .025, _η__p_ 2 = 0.128; test 2, _F_ (3, 65) = 2.88, _P_ = .043, _η__p_ 2 = 0.117. We found that comparisons were effected in 91% of all trials (except for the control condition). Comparisons between normal anatomy were particularly common (45.8%) in all conditions.

## Conclusions

Comparing cases can be an efficient way of learning to interpret radiographs, especially when the comparison technique used is specifically tailored to the learning goal. Eye tracking provided insight into the comparison process, by showing that few comparisons were made between abnormalities, for example.

It is common practice for radiologists to compare films of a particular patient over time. This practice is taught to radiologist in training . It was found that, especially in the case of junior radiology residents, abnormalities are more easily detected when a prior image with no abnormalities (normal image) is presented alongside the case to be diagnosed . Hence, comparison can help to differentiate abnormalities from normal anatomy .

In a context of radiology education, it is of paramount importance that students _learn_ to recognize common abnormalities on radiographs . Educational literature suggests that the use of comparison can bolster this learning process . The web-based training program COMPARE (University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany) , for example, uses a page format in which a normal image flanks a pathologic image, and students are prompted to compare these. As much as 91% of the students and 88% of the residents who used this program valued the technique as useful or very useful . In addition, it was found that students learned more effectively when comparing focal diseases (ie, lesions in one location) to normal images than when comparing two pathologic images .

Type of Comparison Study Condition Disease/Normal Condition Different-Disease Condition Same-Disease Condition Total Focal ( _n_ = 20) Diffuse ( _n_ = 20) Focal ( _n_ = 20) Diffuse ( _n_ = 20) Focal ( _n_ = 20) Diffuse ( _n_ = 20) ( _n_ = 120) (1) Involves an abnormality 12 (9.8 %) 24 (27.0 %) 39 (31.2 %) 75 (11.7 %) (2) Comparison of the same organ 49 (39.8 %) 65 (63.1%) 36 (40.4 %) 46 (52.3 %) 40 (32.0 %) 57 (51.3 %) 293 (45.8 %) (3) Comparison of different organs 62 (50.4 %) 38 (36.9%) 29 (32.4 %) 42 (47.7 %) 46 (36.8 %) 54 (48.3 %) 271 (42.4 %) Total number of comparison saccades 123 (100 %) 103 (100 %) 89 (100 %) 88 (100 %) 125 (100 %) 111 (100 %) 639 (100 %)

A trial refers to the eye movements of one participant on one case pair. Forty trials from each condition (20 focal case pairs, 20 diffuse case pairs) were randomly selected. All comparison saccades in these trials (639 in total) were classified as (1) a comparison involving an abnormality, (2) a comparison of the same organ, or (3) a comparison of different organs. Comparisons in the control condition have not been analyzed. Numbers and percentages add up to 100% vertically, representing the total number of saccades affected in the 20 trials within a condition and type of image. For example, of all 123 saccades affected in the 20 focal trials from the disease/normal condition, 12 (9.8%) were comparisons involving an abnormality, 49 (39.8%) were comparisons of the same organ, and 62 (50.4%) were comparisons of different organs.
