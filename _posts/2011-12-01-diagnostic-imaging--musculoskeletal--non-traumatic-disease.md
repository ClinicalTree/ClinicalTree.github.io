_Diagnostic Imaging: Musculoskeletal: Non-traumatic Disease_ is a new print and electronic reference textbook covering nontraumatic and non-sports-related musculoskeletal imaging. The book contains more than 4500 images with detailed captions focusing on arthritis, osseous tumors, soft tissue tumors, metabolic bone disease, infectious processes, systemic disease, drug-related and nutritional disease, and congenital and developmental musculoskeletal abnormalities. The companion online Amirsys eBook Advantage provides many additional annotated images.

_Musculoskeletal: Non-traumatic Disease_ offers a sectioned format covering nontraumatic musculoskeletal pathology, with information contained in bulleted text and “key facts” boxes. The authors neatly organize the text and images but also provide prose introductions for major sections of the text to outline each individual author’s approach to difficult topics. The section on osseous tumors and “tumor-like” conditions is particularly well written, with a focus on management, and is well detailed with high-quality images. The larger topics in this textbook are devoted at least six pages, with rarer diseases included in one-page chapters to keep content balanced for real-world interpretation. The table of contents is instrumental in making the most optimal use of this reference text.

I find _Musculoskeletal: Non-traumatic Disease_ useful for practicing radiologists, musculoskeletal radiology fellows, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists, and other practitioners interested in the daily practice of nontraumatic musculoskeletal disease. The easily searchable reference with eBook Advantage companion is a nice bonus that allows for always up-to-date information and easy search capability. The online version is a unique feature of this reference text series that allows owners to register their copies and easily search for images and captions online in a similar format as the hardcover text. The online companion offers many additional images not found in the book. The reference hardcover text can be burdensome to carry around, and having the online eBook Advantage tool always available is a quite welcome feature included with purchase.

_Musculoskeletal: Non-traumatic Disease_ is a great addition to the wonderful _Diagnostic Imaging_ series of beautifully illustrated and well-organized reference textbooks designed specifically to help radiologists and clinicians reach reliable conclusions in a practical, easy-to-use, “go-to” reference. Outstanding color graphics in this book illustrate the anatomy and high-quality radiologic images of various nontraumatic musculoskeletal diseases. This is an outstanding comprehensive reference on imaging of the musculoskeletal system that will help radiologists and clinicians become familiarized with the myriad appearances of various nontraumatic pathologic musculoskeletal conditions.
