## Rationale and Objectives

To quantify spatial distribution of emphysema using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), we applied semiautomated analysis with internal attenuation calibration to measure regional air volume, tissue volume, and fractional tissue volume (FTV = tissue/\[air + tissue\] volume) in well-characterized patients studied by the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC).

## Methods

HRCT was obtained at supine end-inspiration and end-expiration, and prone end-inspiration from 31 patients with mild, moderate, severe, or very severe emphysema (stages II–V, forced expiratory volume at 1 second >75%, 51%–75%, 21%–50% and ≤20% predicted, respectively). Control data were from 20 healthy non-smokers (stage I). Each lobe was analyzed separately. Heterogeneity of FTV was assessed from coefficients of variation (CV) within and among lobes, and the kurtosis and skewness of FTV histograms.

## Results

In emphysema, lobar air volume increased up to 177% above normal except in the right middle lobe. Lobar tissue volume increased up to 107% in mild-moderate stages then normalized in advanced stages. Normally, FTV was up to 82% higher in lower than upper lobes. In mild-moderate emphysema, lobar FTV increased by up to 74% above normal at supine inspiration. In severe emphysema, FTV declined below normal in all lobes and positions in correlation with pulmonary function ( _P_ < .05). Markers of FTV heterogeneity increased steadily with disease stage in correlation with pulmonary function ( _P_ < .05); the pattern is distinct from that seen in interstitial lung disease (ILD).

## Conclusion

CT-derived biomarkers differentiate the spatial patterns of emphysema distribution and heterogeneity from that in ILD. Early emphysema is associated with elevated tissue volume and FTV, consistent with hyperemia, inflammation or atelectasis.

## Introduction

Chest computed tomography (CT) is extensively used in the diagnosis and management of chronic lung disease. Clinical evaluation by CT is usually qualitative or semiquantitative, resulting in unavoidable spatial, temporal, interobserver and interscanner variability, particularly in the presence of volume change or local architectural distortion, making it difficult to match the same anatomical regions on successive scans. Currently, the large digital dataset generated by each CT study is routinely underused. Given the widespread use of CT, its expense and the small but real risk of harm due to cumulative radiation exposure , there is a corresponding need for standardized imaging biomarkers to objectively characterize anatomical disease severity and distribution, monitor pathological progression and assess response to therapy. By maximally exploiting the information content of CT datasets, quantitative image analysis has the potential to improve the precision and accuracy of patient stratification, cross-sectional comparisons and longitudinal follow-up.

Both attenuation-based and texture-based image analysis algorithms have been used to quantify pulmonary emphysema. Attenuation-based methods commonly employ an arbitrary threshold value (eg, −910 Hounsfield units \[HU\]) , to separate normal from emphysematous parenchyma ; these methods are relatively easy to use but highly sensitive to lung inflation. A range of threshold values has been reported , and most studies do not take into account intra- or interlobar heterogeneity, a key feature in emphysema evolution. Texture-based methods rely on analysis of detailed morphologic patterns on high-resolution CT (HRCT) (eg, shape, skewness, kurtosis, gradient, contrast, correlation, circularity, aspect ratio, area, number of clusters). Although offering more information, texture-based analysis involves greater computational complexity and higher cost.
