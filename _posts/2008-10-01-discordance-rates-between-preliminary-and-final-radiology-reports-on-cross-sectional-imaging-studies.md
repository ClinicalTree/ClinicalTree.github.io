## Rationale and Objectives

The goal was to determine discordance rates between preliminary radiology reports provided by on-call radiology house staff and final reports from attending radiologists on cross-sectional imaging studies requested by emergency department staff after hours.

## Materials and Methods

A triplicate carbon copy reporting form was developed to provide permanent records of preliminary radiology reports and to facilitate communication of discrepant results to the emergency department. Data were collected over 21 weeks to determine the number of discordant readings. Patients' medical records were reviewed to show whether discrepancies were significant or insignificant and to assess their impact on subsequent management and patient outcome.

## Results

The emergency department requested 2830 cross-sectional imaging studies after hours and 2311 (82%) had a copy of the triplicate form stored in radiology archives. Discrepancies between the preliminary and final report were recorded in 47 (2.0%), with 37 (1.6%) considered significant: 14 patients needed no change, 13 needed a minor change, and 10 needed a major change in subsequent management. Ten (0.43%) of the discordant scans were considered insignificant. A random sample of 104 (20%) of the 519 scans without a paper triplicate form was examined. Seventy-one (68%) did have a scanned copy of the triplicate form in the electronic record, with a discrepancy recorded in 3 (4.2%), which was not statistically different from the main cohort ( _P_ = .18).

## Conclusion

Our study suggests a high level of concordance between preliminary reports from on-call radiology house staff and final reports by attending subspecialty radiologists on cross-sectional imaging studies requested by the emergency department.

Cross-sectional imaging plays an essential diagnostic role in the evaluation of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). In the majority of academic institutions, the on-call radiology service is primarily provided by radiology residents, with back-up coverage from board-certified radiology fellows and attending subspecialty radiologists. Preliminary interpretations are rendered to the ED by the on-call resident, with the final reading being provided by a subspecialty radiology attending the following morning. Residents are often required to interpret complex cross-sectional imaging studies and independently make decisions, and this valuable on-call experience is considered an integral part of radiology residency training. However, emergency physicians and trauma surgeons have expressed concerns about the reliability of preliminary radiology reports provided by residents and believe that around-the-clock radiology attending coverage is essential to prevent errors in the management of patients presenting to the ED ( ). Other quality concerns include the timeliness and manner in which discrepant results are conveyed to the ED and whether the discrepancy is accurately documented within the final radiology report or patient's records ( ). Without a clear protocol for ensuring that this information and its subsequent affect on patient management are accurately entered into the patient's medical record, patient care may be adversely affected.

Previous studies have shown a wide variation in reported discrepancy rates between preliminary reports provided by the on-call resident and final reports from the subspecialty attending radiologist, ranging from 3% to 29.9% ( ). Although several studies have examined the significance of such discrepancies on subsequent patient care and eventual outcome ( ), no attention has been focused on how quickly or effectively the discrepancy was communicated to the ED staff.
