## Rationale and Objectives

It is common practice in academic hospitals for radiology residents to provide preliminary interpretations for radiologic examinations performed in the emergency department (ED) during off-hours. In this study, we used a software program called Minerva to identify and track discrepancies between resident and faculty interpretation of ED studies. The objective was to determine if missed case conferences could reduce the number of resident discrepancies related to the types of cases reviewed.

## Materials and Methods

We used Minerva to identify and grade faculty-modified resident preliminary reports as minor or major discrepancies depending on whether the discrepancy had the potential to affect patient management or outcome. Minor and major discrepancy rates were calculated for all residents to evaluate call performance, establish benchmarks, and develop interventions to reduce the number of discrepant cases.

## Results

The total discrepancy rate for all residents ( _n_ = 22) was 2.6% with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.7%. The average major discrepancy rate for all residents was 1.1% with a SD of 0.4%. Trend analysis of missed cases was used to generate topic-specific resident missed case conferences on acromioclavicular joint separation injuries, elbow joint effusions, and osteochondral fractures, which resulted in an overall 64% decrease in the number of missed cases related to these injuries.

## Conclusions

The systematic evaluation of resident discrepancies using a simple software application provides a competency-based metric to assess call performance, establish benchmarks, and develop missed case conferences. This process is expected to result in further reduction in resident discrepancy rates and missed cases.

Improving quality and safety in radiology is becoming increasingly important given the dramatic conclusions of the Institute of Medicine's report “To Err is Human,” which states that an estimated 100,000 lives per year are lost due to medical errors . Studies subsequent to the Institute of Medicine's report identify suboptimal radiology processes and the lack of useful outcome data in the radiology literature as contributors to the overwhelming number of medical errors and the associated economic costs, estimated as more than $38 billion annually . A critical component to improving radiology quality and safety is the process of defining radiology quality metrics and developing the information technology systems to quantify and track quality metrics. Peer review is a methodology used to evaluate radiologist performance with the ultimate goal of reducing errors and improving patient care . Although many departments have established peer review systems in place for evaluating and reporting radiologist performance, there are few equivalent programs for evaluating and tracking radiology resident performance.

As part of an ongoing quality assurance project, we have developed a database application called Minerva that accesses the Radiology Information System (RIS) database, identifies all preliminary interpretations provided by residents during independent call, and allows grading and tracking of minor and major discrepancies between resident and faculty interpretations. Discrepancy rates were calculated and used as a competency-based metric to evaluate call performance, establish benchmarks, and track trends in discrepant cases. Trend analysis of discrepant cases was used to generate topic-specific resident missed case conferences. The purpose of this study was to determine if residents missed case conferences focusing on specific types of missed cases could reduce the number of missed cases, thereby improving discrepancy rates.
