## Rationale and Objectives

Ventilation heterogeneity is a hallmark feature of asthma. Our objective was to evaluate ventilation heterogeneity in patients with severe asthma, both pre- and post-salbutamol, as well as post-methacholine (MCh) challenge using the lung clearance index, free-breathing pulmonary  1  H magnetic resonance imaging (FDMRI), and inhaled-gas MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP).

## Materials and Methods

Sixteen severe asthmatics (49 ± 10 years) provided written informed consent to an ethics board-approved protocol. Spirometry, plethysmography, and multiple breath nitrogen washout to measure the lung clearance index were performed during a single visit within 15 minutes of MRI. Inhaled-gas MRI and FDMRI were performed pre- and post-bronchodilator to generate VDP. For asthmatics with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) >70%  predicted , MRI was also performed before and after MCh challenge. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, Spearman correlations, and a repeated-measures analysis of variance were performed.

## Results

Hyperpolarized  3  He ( _P_ = .02) and FDMRI ( _P_ = .02) VDP significantly improved post-salbutamol and for four asthmatics who could perform MCh ( _n_ = 4).  3  He and FDMRI VDP significantly increased at the provocative concentration of MCh, resulting in a 20% decrease in FEV  1 (PC  20 ) and decreased post-bronchodilator ( _P_ = .02), with a significant difference between methods ( _P_ = .01). FDMRI VDP was moderately correlated with  3  He VDP (ρ = .61, _P_ = .01), but underestimated VDP relative to  3  He VDP (−6 ± 9%). Whereas  3  He MRI VDP was significantly correlated with the lung clearance index, FDMRI was not (ρ = .49, _P_ = .06).

## Conclusions

FDMRI VDP generated in free-breathing asthmatic patients was correlated with static inspiratory breath-hold  3  He MRI VDP but underestimated VDP relative to  3  He MRI VDP. Although less sensitive to salbutamol and MCh, FDMRI VDP may be considered for asthma patient evaluations at centers without inhaled-gas MRI.

## Introduction

Asthma is a chronic and often debilitating airways disease, characterized by intermittent worsening of breathlessness, cough, chest tightness, and wheeze, and is typically diagnosed based on spirometry measurements of bronchodilator reversibility or response to methacholine (MCh) challenge using the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ) . Although current asthma therapies were developed based on FEV  1 improvements , this measurement of airflow limitation is relatively insensitive to small airway obstruction , which is believed to be the main site of inflammation and airway remodeling (or premodeling) in asthma . For many children and adults with asthma, disease control remains elusive, and a recent survey identified that over 90% of Canadian asthmatics reported poorly controlled disease and nearly half did not participate in any exercise of any type due to asthma symptoms . This unacceptable disease morbidity and the large and growing number of asthma patients of all ages have motivated the development of pulmonary imaging approaches to generate new and more sensitive biomarkers of small airway dysfunction. To date, however, it has been complex to use such imaging biomarkers in the development of new therapies in clinical trials or to guide therapy decisions in individual patients.

In asthmatics, thoracic computed tomography (CT) can be used to provide asthma biomarkers of gas-trapping , airway remodeling such as airway wall thickening and lumen narrowing , and dynamic changes in ventilation using xenon-enhanced dual-energy CT . Although ultra low-dose CT methods using iterative adaptive reconstruction methods are now under development , because of radiation dose concerns, the clinical use of CT in asthmatics has been limited, especially in mild disease and in children . Other examples include positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography , both of which have been used in the research setting to evaluate regional ventilation heterogeneity in asthmatics .
