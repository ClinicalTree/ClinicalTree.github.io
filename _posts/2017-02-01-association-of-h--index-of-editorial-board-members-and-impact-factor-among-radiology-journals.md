## Rationale and Objectives

_h_ -Index has been proposed as a useful bibliometric measure for quantifying research productivity. In this current study, we analyzed _h_ -indices of editorial board members of Radiology journals and tested the hypothesis that editorial board members of Radiology journals with higher impact factors (IF) have higher _h_ -indices.

## Materials and Methods

Sixty-two Radiology journals with IF >1 were included. Editorial board members were identified using the journals' websites. Editors' affiliations and research fields of interest were used to distinguish investigators with similar names. Bibliometric indices including number of publications, total citations, citations per publication, and _h_ -index for each editorial board member were obtained using the Web of Science database. Chi-square or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to test for differences in bibliographic measures or demographics between groups.

## Results

Among the editorial boards of 62 journals, the median \[interquartile range\] board _h_ -index was 26 \[18, 31\] and had 36 \[17, 56\] members. The median journal IF was 2.27 \[1.74, 3.31\]. We identified a total of 2204 distinct editors; they had a median \[interquartile range\] _h_ -index of 23 \[13, 35\], 120 \[58, 215\] total publications, 1938 \[682, 4634\] total citations, and an average of 15.7 \[9.96, 24.8\] citations per publication. The boards of journals with IF above the median had significantly higher _h_ -indices ( _P_ = .002), total publications ( _P_ = .01), and total and average citations (both any \[ _P_ = .003, .009\] and nonself-citations \[ _P_ = .001, .002\]) than journals below the median.

## Conclusions

Our data indicate that board members of Radiology journals with higher IF have greater _h_ -indices compared to lower IF journals.

## Introduction

Scientific productivity of scholars has been traditionally assessed based on simple measurements such as total number of publications. To date, these measurements continue to play an important role in comparing scientific accomplishments among faculty members, and in their evaluation and consideration for promotion or tenure. This method of evaluating research productivity is not precise enough and does not account for the scientific impact of the counted publications. To overcome such challenges, other methods of evaluating scientists have been proposed . In 2005, J. E. Hirsch described _h_ -index as a measure to quantify research productivity of an individual researcher . Since its introduction, _h_ -index has received a great amount of acceptability. It was originally used among physicists , but is now being applied to measure scientific performance of researchers and faculty members in many fields of science, including several medical disciplines .

According to the definition, a researcher has an _h_ -index of h if he or she has h publications that have been cited at least h times each . For example, an author of 10 papers that have been cited 10, 10, 9, 8, 7, 7, 4, 4, 1, and 0 times respectively, has an _h_ -index of six (six papers cited six times or more). So, it has the advantage of taking into account total publications of a researcher and his or her citations at the same time.

Journals were dichotomized into above median impact factor (IF) (≥2.27) and below median IF (<2.27) groups. Except for number of editors,bibliometric values for each journal were taken to be the median value of its editorial board members.
