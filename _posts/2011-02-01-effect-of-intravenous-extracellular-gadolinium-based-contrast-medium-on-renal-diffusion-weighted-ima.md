## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to compare precontrast and postcontrast renal diffusion-weighted images for signal intensity (SI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and lesion conspicuity.

## Materials and Methods

In 62 patients (mean age, 54 ± 29; 29 men, 33 women) precontrast and postcontrast (0.1 mmol/kg of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast medium; mean, 3.3 ± 0.9 minutes\], diffusion-weighted images at b values of 50 and 400 s/mm  2 were compared (3 T). The SI, signal-to-noise ratio, and ADC of the renal cortex, medulla, and lesions were measured. Lesion contrast-to-noise ratios (against the medulla and cortex) were calculated.

## Results

Postcontrast medullary SI decreased by 50% and cortical SI decreased by 33% and 39% on images at b = 50 s/mm  2 and b = 400 s/mm  2 , respectively ( _P_ < .0001). The SI and signal-to-noise ratio of lesions did not change significantly after contrast, but lesion-medullary contrast-to-noise ratio was increased by 50% at both b = 50 s/mm  2 and b = 400 s/mm  2 ( _P_ < .005 and _P_ = .0005, respectively) following contrast. Qualitative postcontrast lesion conspicuity was improved, with average scores of 2.8 ± 0.9 for all lesions (κ = 0.7 ± 0.08) and 3.2 ± 0.9 for solid lesions (κ = 0.82 ± 0.1). The ADC of renal cortex decreased ( _P_ = .03), but the ADC of renal medulla or renal lesions did not significantly change.

## Conclusion

Postcontrast diffusion-weighted imaging causes a significant decrease in renal parenchymal signal without a significant change in lesion signal, resulting in increased lesion conspicuity.

Recent technical innovations have expanded the application of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the field of abdominal imaging. These innovations include echo-planar imaging, parallel imaging, high-performance gradients, phased-array multichannel surface coils, and higher magnetic field strengths . Promising results have been obtained using DWI in the abdomen and pelvis, particularly for assessment of the liver, kidneys, and pelvic structures .

To date, DWI has been performed before intravenous extracellular gadolinium-based contrast medium (E-GdCM) administration . However, the images are not uncommonly degraded because of various technical limitations and thus need to be repeated at the end the study, by which time contrast material has already been administered. The effect of E-GdCM on image quality and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values has been studied for the brain and liver, with no significant difference detected before and after the administration of contrast on DWI . In the assessment of the liver, one study concluded that contrast administration in diagnostic doses did not limit the utility of DWI . However, the accumulation of a larger amount of E-GdCM in tissues such as the kidneys may change the signal intensity (SI) of tissue in DWI sequences. This change in SI is mostly attributed to T2∗ shortening and susceptibility effects . The fact that the kidney excretes E-GdCM causes the organ’s signal characteristics to be influenced differently compared to the other soft tissues, such as on postcontrast diffusion-weighted images. In fact, it has been shown that renal excretion of E-GdCM will result in signal loss in the normal renal parenchyma on postcontrast diffusion-weighted images .

![Figure 1, Diffusion-weighted images of the right kidney at b = 50 s/mm 2 (b50) with corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Images were obtained before the administration of intravenous contrast (precontrast) and 2 and 7 minutes after contrast (post). As evident, early (2 minutes) and delayed (7 minutes) postcontrast images show different effects of contrast on the degree of corticomedullary differentiation and the amount of signal cancellation of the renal collecting system. Although variable in different patients, in our practice, 2 to 4 minutes after contrast injection is likely the optimal timing for data acquisition. Susceptibility artifacts caused by accumulation of contrast in collecting system, especially in patients with large renal pelvises, can degrade image quality if postcontrast diffusion-weighted images are obtained too late (ie, >5 minutes).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofIntravenousExtracellularGadoliniumBasedContrastMediumonRenalDiffusionWeightedImages/0_1s20S1076633210005349.jpg)

![Figure 2, Precontrast and postcontrast diffusion weighted images at b = 50 s/mm 2 (b50) with corresponding apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps show the effect of extracellular gadolinium-based contrast medium on renal parenchyma and collecting system. Our postcontrast diffusion-weighted images were usually obtained between 2 and 4 minutes (mean, 3.3 ± 0.9 minutes) after contrast administration. In this patient, who had the longest wait in our series, postcontrast images were obtained at 4 minutes 20 seconds after injection. Note the signal drop out of the renal pelvis with some susceptibility effect around it on postcontrast images. Also note that on postcontrast images, the spleen signal is slightly increased, but liver signal remains unchanged. Mild splenomegaly is seen.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofIntravenousExtracellularGadoliniumBasedContrastMediumonRenalDiffusionWeightedImages/1_1s20S1076633210005349.jpg)
