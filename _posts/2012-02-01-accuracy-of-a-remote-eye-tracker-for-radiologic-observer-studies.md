## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the accuracy and reproducibility of a remote eye-tracking system for studies of observer gaze while displaying volumetric chest computed tomography (CT) images.

## Materials and Methods

Four participants performed calibrations using three different gray-scale backgrounds (black, gray, and white). Each participant then observed a three-dimensional 10-point test pattern embedded in five Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) datasets (test backgrounds): a full 190-section chest CT scan, 190 copies of a single chest CT section, and three 190-section datasets of homogeneous intensity (black, gray, and white).

## Results

Significant variances between participants, calibration backgrounds, and test backgrounds were observed. The least mean systematic error (deviation of recorded gaze position from target) was obtained when the calibration background and test background were black (27 pixels). Systematic error increased when displaying a test background that deviated from the calibration background intensity. Hence, the largest mean systematic error occurred when calibrating to a black background and displaying a white background (67 pixels). For complex chest CT volumes the white calibration background performed best (38 pixels). An angular analysis of the systematic error was performed and demonstrated that the systemic error primarily affects the vertical position of the estimated gaze position.

## Conclusion

Our findings indicate a potential source of systematic error during gaze recording in a dynamic environment and highlight the importance of configuring the calibration procedure according to the brightness of the display. We recommend that investigators develop routines for postcalibration accuracy measurement and report the effective accuracy for the display environment in which the data are collected.

Understanding the perceptual mechanisms involved in the interpretation of medical images is an important facet of the complex and interlinked cognitive process that determines if the readers succeed or fail to detect abnormalities in the images . Several theories regarding potential sources of detection and interpretation errors of human readers have been proposed, including the satisfaction of search error , in which the detection of lesions influences the likelihood of subsequent detections, and the global perception , in which an instant holistic understanding of the image occurs almost immediately after the appearance of an image.

Research using eye-tracking methods provides insight into the cognitive processes involved in the visual search of medical images. Most investigations using these methods have been focused on understanding the visual search patterns within two-dimensional images, such as when reading plain film mammograms or searching for pulmonary nodules on radiographs .

All CT sections were displayed using a window width of 1600 and window level of −500. For the volumetric display, each target was drawn onto 10 consecutive sections followed by an animated transition to the next point in the next 10 sections (figure illustrates all targets projected onto a single section).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AccuracyofaRemoteEyeTrackerforRadiologicObserverStudies/1_1s20S1076633211004946.jpg)

The term _PT  ij_ represents the interaction effect between participant _i_ , and target _j_ , etc. The analysis of the magnitude of variability was performed similarly. The significance ( _P_ values) of estimated effects and corresponding factors were computed using standard ANOVA based F-tests with appropriate degrees of freedom .
