This is the second edition of this text, updated from the original text published in 2001. _Musculoskeletal MRI_ is a textbook covering all the major topics in a succinct body of work. The intended audience is primarily radiology residents, but musculoskeletal radiology fellows, practicing radiologists, sports medicine physicians, and orthopedic surgeons would benefit from this textbook. The same authors of the original text have collaborated to produce the second edition.

The organization of the text has not changed and the same general topics are covered as in the first edition, beginning with basic principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There are dedicated chapters for bone marrow, tendons and muscles, and peripheral nerves along with individual chapters for tumors, arthritis, infection, and trauma. The last eight chapters of the book discuss each major joint, including the spine and temporomandibular joint. Topics are covered with helpful drawings, high-quality images, and quick reference boxes that highlight important features.

The goal of the authors, as discussed in the preface, is to provide a practical textbook that provides the reader with an approach to musculoskeletal MRI without overwhelming detail; in their words, “less is more.” In my opinion, they achieved this goal in the first edition and have improved on their work with the second edition.

The second edition includes advances in knowledge and imaging technique that have occurred since the initial publication. Many new figures and illustrations have been added that, without exception, are improvements since the first edition. The authors have managed to expand and improve the first edition without significantly increasing the overall length of the text.

This is an excellent, very well-written textbook of musculoskeletal MRI. The image quality is superb throughout the entire text. This book is extremely useful for learning an approach to musculoskeletal MR imaging and is a “must read” for any radiology resident. It would also be very useful to a practicing radiologist and all MRI reading rooms would benefit from a copy of this book. Significant improvements make this a worthwhile investment for owners of the first edition.
