## Rationale and Objectives

With employment of both multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and endobronchial procedures in multicenter studies, effects of timing of endobronchial procedures on quantitative imaging (Q-MDCT) metrics is a question of increasing importance.

## Materials and Methods

Six subjects were studied via MDCT at baseline, immediately following and at 4 hours and 24 hours post-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (right middle lobe and lingula). Through quantitative image analysis, non-air, or “tissue” volume (TV) in each lung and lobe was recorded. Change in TV from baseline was used to infer retention and redistribution of lavage fluid.

## Results

Bronchoscopist reported unrecovered BAL volume correlated well with Q-MDCT for whole lung measures, but less well with individual lobes indicating redistribution. TV in all lobes except the right lower lobe differed significantly ( _P_ < .05) from baseline immediately post lavage. At 24 hours, all lobes except the left lower lobe (small 1% mean difference at 24 hours) returned to baseline.

## Conclusions

These findings suggest fluid movement affecting Q-MDCT metrics between lobes and between lungs before eventual resolution, and preclude protocols involving the lavage of one lung and imaging of the other to avoid interactions. We demonstrate that Q-MDCT is sensitive to lavage fluid retention and redistribution, and endobronchial procedures should not precede Q-MDCT imaging by less than 24 hours.

This study seeks to understand the interaction of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and quantitative measures obtained from multidetector-row x-ray computed tomography (Q-MDCT). There has been considerable effort to use regional lung density measures from Q-MDCT for the objective assessment of lung pathology . Q-MDCT density measures have been shown to accurately reflect regional air and non-air content of the lung , and comparisons with biopsy samples have been made in humans to validate these measures .

BAL is used in pulmonary research and clinical practice as a means of access to the lung parenchyma. During the lavage procedure, 30%–40% of instilled saline is left unrecovered in the lungs of healthy patients. The unrecovered volume is increased in smokers and patients with obstructive lung disease . Volumes of individual aliquots instilled by both clinicians and researchers vary, usually between 20 and 200 mL; approximately 100–200 mL cumulative saline is used at each site . Despite BAL's wide use as an academic, diagnostic, and therapeutic tool, specifics of the procedure are not standardized and many results are susceptible to a great degree of uncertainty, as summarized by Baughman . Of particular importance in recent efforts to establish study designs for complex multicenter studies of the lung has been the question of how to sequence an endobronchial procedure relative to a Q-MDCT study. With the difficulty of scheduling the Q-MDCT exam and the pressure to complete a series of procedures in a single day, there have been efforts to simply allow the Q-MDCT scan to float within the order of procedures. Little is known, however, of the fate or consequences of unretrieved saline. Klein et al have demonstrated that for as much as an hour or longer after BAL, lung mechanics as well as blood gases can be significantly altered. This is of interest as one might not expect that a localized alteration of a single lobar segment would change lung mechanics. Imaging studies of BAL fluid itself are largely limited to chest films and V/Q scans . One such study found a correlation between volume of retained fluid and qualitative measures of opacity on immediate postlavage images; these opacities cleared after 24 hours . Though studies have combined both Q-MDCT and BAL as adjuncts in patient treatment or even compared their respective diagnostic values . CT data of BAL fluid itself is minimal. The effects of BAL on Q-MDCT is critical, particularly when Q-MDCT measures are being sought to follow, for instance, progression of emphysema when it has been shown that such changes are on the order of 2.5 Hounsfield unit change in lung density per year .

Bronchoscopist-reported volumes instilled and recovered during a bronchoalveolar lavage procedure. During aspiration of subject 1, the bronchoscopist did not count the “junk” aspirate, a term used for the first 20 mL of aspirate. Subject 2 was reported to have immediately coughed out much of the lavage delivered to the right middle lobe before aspiration.

Top panel shows the correlation for the whole lung, whereas the lower panels depict the correlations for the left and right lungs separately. Note the strong correlation between the bronchoscopist's report and the CT-based quantitative findings for the whole lung plot ( upper panel ) and the poor correlation found at the level of the individual lungs ( lower panels ). The authors believe that this indicates that early after the bronchoalveolar lavage procedure, retained fluid redistributes not only between lobes but also between lungs.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofSegmentalBronchoalveolarLavageonQuantitativeComputedTomographyoftheLung/0_1s20S1076633211001644.jpg)
