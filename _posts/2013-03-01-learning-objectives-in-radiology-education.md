Learning objectives are a critical step in the creation and implementation of a radiology curriculum. Their use is mandated by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education, and the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education, but more importantly they can have a significant beneficial impact on quality of radiology education programs. Learning objectives guide student learning, help clarify our teaching goals, and simplify learner testing and evaluation. This article will review the components of a proper learning objective and provide a simple, straightforward approach to writing them effectively.

A learning objective is a statement that describes in specific terms what knowledge, skills, or attitudes learners should be able to demonstrate following instruction. They aren't simply a “table of contents” style list of topics that will be addressed or a list of teaching goals for a session or course. Rather, a learning objective should outline what students will be able to do that they couldn't do before the teaching exercise. Fundamentally, learning objectives should target the essential take home points of a course.

The creation of learning objectives is often an undervalued step in medical curriculum planning, in part because as teachers we are often accustomed to focusing on our goals. Although it is useful to communicate what we as educators want to accomplish, in the form of a list of topics to be covered or “goals” for a session, this is not a substitute for learning objectives. Fundamentally, a learning objective is written with the intent of learning rather than teaching as the goal. Learning objectives communicate what the learner should be able to do as a result of the teaching session or curriculum. In other words, they are outcomes-based and learner-centered.

Learning objectives have been used in different areas of education for many years, more so after being popularized by Robert Mager in his text _Preparing Instructional Objectives_ in 1962 . However, their integration into medical education, at least at a postgraduate level, is more recent, coinciding to a degree with the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) guidelines for competency-based education . Among academic radiologists and undoubtedly physician educators in many fields, confusion still exists as to the correct use and utility of learning objectives. This article will review the components of a proper learning objective and provide a simple, straightforward approach to writing them effectively.

## Administrative oversight: The requirements

Whether pertaining to undergraduate medical curricula, radiology residency programs, or continuing medical education activities, learning objectives are now a required component in medical curricular planning.

## Undergraduate Medical Education

The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) has been the accrediting authority for US medical schools since 1942 and now has multiple requirements for the use of learning objectives in the undergraduate medical realm. Specifically, an educational program requirement (ED-1) states: “The faculty of an institution that offers a medical education program must define the objectives of its program. The objectives must serve as guides for establishing curriculum content and provide the basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the program” .

Benefits of Learning Objectives for Both Learners and Educators


Benefits of Learning Objectives Allow communication with others about the content and intent of a teaching activity Clarify and help direct teaching goals Ensure that educational methods (eg, lecture, small group discussion) are properly aligned with the goals of the session Help focus studying by ensuring that students concentrate on what is essential Provide a check as to whether a curriculum teaches at multiple cognitive levels as outlined in Bloom's taxonomy Simplify assessment: Assessment questions should match the content and Bloom's level of the relevant learning objectives Give students a clear idea of what is expected of them Give students a better platform to evaluate our performance as educators
