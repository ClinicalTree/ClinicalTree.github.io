The mainstays of radiologic education include independent reading, didactic lectures, proctored case conferences, and mentored clinical practice with progressive autonomy. However, the advent of the digital radiology department has provided opportunities to enhance radiology training by simulating clinical practice in a controlled environment. There is growing acknowledgment of the benefits of simulation-based learning, which may include cognitive and technical gains for the individual trainee, improvements in team interaction, and promotion of patient safety. Despite these potential benefits, the use of simulation in radiology education has been relatively unexplored, with no comprehensive text on the topic. To address this need, experts in image-based simulation training at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine have produced _Simulation in Radiology_ , which is a thorough exploration of the current and future applications of simulation-based techniques in the training of radiology residents and fellows.

_Simulation in Radiology_ is organized into three separate sections, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of simulation-based training in radiology.

The first section, “Simulation: Technical Considerations,” provides a general discussion of simulation-based training, including an overview of basic terms and concepts, basic simulation techniques, and ethical/legal concerns regarding cadaver use. A separate discussion on computer-based simulation is included. Where appropriate, black-and-white images (e.g., photographs and screen captures) are included to clarify the text.

The second section, “Simulation in Education,” addresses general principles of education and testing. Most of the section is not specific to radiology training, per se, although a separate chapter is devoted to this topic. A discussion of meaningful assessment in simulation-based training is a particularly valuable and well-executed passage.

The third section, “Applying Simulation in Radiology,” comprises 18 chapters regarding simulation-based radiology training, including reviews of the scientific literature and descriptions of current work. Topics discussed include simulations of vascular and nonvascular intervention within the torso, neuroaxis, extremities, and in children; simulating adverse reactions to intravenous contrast agents; emergency radiology; and sedation/analgesia in the radiology suite.

This book is comprehensive, yet concise and well written; it is thoroughly referenced and includes images that enhance the prose. Its primary value will be for leaders of radiology training programs (including department chairs, vice-chairs of education, program directors, and trainees) who are looking to develop simulation-based curricula to enhance trainee education. It is possible that practicing radiologists who are looking to expand their skill sets will discover new opportunities to further their training, although they are unlikely the editors' target audience.
