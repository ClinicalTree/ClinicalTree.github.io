## Purpose

We aimed to present three new ultrasound signs—gallbladder scalloping, mammillated caudate lobe, and inferior vena cava scalloping—and determine their accuracy in diagnosing liver cirrhosis.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 201 consecutive patients with a history of chronic liver disease who had undergone ultrasound imaging and liver biopsy were identified. A senior ultrasound radiologist blindly reviewed the ultrasound examinations. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of diagnosing cirrhosis were calculated for all evaluated ultrasound signs and selected combinations of signs, using the liver biopsy results as the reference standard.

## Results

Of the 201 patients, 152 (76%) had either pathology-proven cirrhosis or significant fibrosis. Caudate lobe hypertrophy was the most specific (88%) and most positive predictor (90%) for cirrhosis, whereas mammillated caudate lobe was the most sensitive (78%). Inferior vena cava scalloping was the most specific (78%) of the three proposed ultrasound signs. When signs were combined, the presence of either gallbladder scalloping or liver surface nodularity was highly sensitive for cirrhosis (87%), whereas the presence of either gallbladder scalloping or inferior vena cava scalloping with caudate lobe hypertrophy was highly specific (93%).

## Conclusions

Gallbladder scalloping, mammillated caudate lobe, and inferior vena cava scalloping are three novel signs that improve the accuracy of ultrasound in diagnosing cirrhosis.

## Introduction

The diagnosis of cirrhosis using ultrasound (US) is difficult in patients with chronic liver disease. US imaging helps detect liver size and morphology, vascular flow patterns, and the presence or absence of ascites. It is widely accepted that liver surface nodularity and morphological changes such as caudate lobe hypertrophy, when severe enough, can be used to diagnose cirrhosis . Despite these findings, and the documented widespread use of US to screen for hepatocellular carcinoma , to this day, most physicians still rely on tissue biopsy for diagnosing cirrhosis.

Although perceived to be a definitive test, liver biopsy is not the ideal “gold standard.” Needle biopsy obtains a very small piece of tissue—approximately 1/50,000 of the entire liver—and is therefore subject to sampling error; false-negative rates of up to 30% have been reported . In addition, despite improvements in technique, biopsy remains an invasive procedure with a risk of complications, including bleeding, infection, and death . A need, therefore, exists for a reliable, noninvasive, rapid method for diagnosing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis . New techniques, including transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse, and magnetic resonance elastography have shown promising results. However, cost and operator inexperience have limited their widespread implementation .
