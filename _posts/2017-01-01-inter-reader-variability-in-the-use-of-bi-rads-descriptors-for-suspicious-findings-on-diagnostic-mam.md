## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to determine the inter-observer agreement among academic breast radiologists when using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lesion descriptors for suspicious findings on diagnostic mammography.

## Materials and Methods

Ten experienced academic breast radiologists across five medical centers independently reviewed 250 de-identified diagnostic mammographic cases that were previously assessed as BI-RADS 4 or 5 with subsequent pathologic diagnosis by percutaneous or surgical biopsy. Each radiologist assessed the presence of the following suspicious mammographic findings: mass, asymmetry (one view), focal asymmetry (two views), architectural distortion, and calcifications. For any identified calcifications, the radiologist also described the morphology and distribution. Inter-observer agreement was determined with Fleiss kappa statistic. Agreement was also calculated by years of experience.

## Results

Of the 250 lesions, 156 (62%) were benign and 94 (38%) were malignant. Agreement among the 10 readers was strongest for recognizing the presence of calcifications (k = 0.82). There was substantial agreement among the readers for the identification of a mass (k = 0.67), whereas agreement was fair for the presence of a focal asymmetry (k = 0.21) or architectural distortion (k = 0.28). Agreement for asymmetries (one view) was slight (k = 0.09). Among the categories of calcification morphology and distribution, reader agreement was moderate (k = 0.51 and k = 0.60, respectively). Readers with more experience (10 or more years in clinical practice) did not demonstrate higher levels of agreement compared to those with less experience.

## Conclusions

Strength of agreement varies widely for different types of mammographic findings, even among dedicated academic breast radiologists. More subtle findings such as asymmetries and architectural distortion demonstrated the weakest agreement. Studies that seek to evaluate the predictive value of certain mammographic features for malignancy should take into consideration the inherent interpretive variability for these findings.

## Introduction

The mammography lexicon of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR BI-RADS) was developed to standardize reporting and encourage uniform use of terms among radiologists . This lexicon has since become central to the practice of mammography. Utilization of a common language allows for clearer communication of mammographic findings to providers across practices. In addition, standardized BI-RADS terminology has proven invaluable for collecting and analyzing data on mammographic features, and for determining the predictive value of lesion descriptors for malignancy.

Several studies have reported the positive predictive value of the BI-RADS mammographic features . For example, studies have demonstrated that BI-RADS descriptors for calcification morphology and distribution can help determine the risk of malignancy , with round or punctate calcifications demonstrating the lowest probability of malignancy and fine linear branching calcifications having the highest probability. Similarly, the distribution of calcifications from least to most likely to represent malignancy is diffuse, regional, grouped, linear, and segmental. Positive predictive values for malignancy have also been described for non-calcified mammographic lesions, including masses, asymmetries, and architectural distortion .

BI-RADS Descriptors for Suspicious Lesions


Descriptor Definition Mass Seen on two projections; convex outward borders; appears denser in the center than the periphery Focal asymmetry Seen on two projections; lacks the convex outward borders and conspicuity of a mass; may be interspersed with fat Asymmetry Potential mass or focal asymmetry but seen on only one mammographic projection Architectural distortion Distorted parenchyma: thin straight lines or spiculations radiating from a point; focal retraction, distortion or straightening at the edge of parenchyma Calcifications Morphology Round/punctate, amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, or fine linear branching Distribution Diffuse, regional, grouped, linear, or segmental

Descriptors for lesions deemed suspicious (BI-RADS 4/5) were collected. Characteristically benign findings were not described.
