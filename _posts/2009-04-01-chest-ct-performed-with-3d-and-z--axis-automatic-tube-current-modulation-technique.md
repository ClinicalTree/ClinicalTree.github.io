## Rationale and Objectives

Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans are the most effective examinations for detecting lung cancer at an early stage. In chest CT examinations, it is important to consider the reduction of radiation dose, particularly to the mammary gland. The objective of this study was to assess breast doses and effective doses on chest CT examinations between three-dimensional and _z_ -axis automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) techniques.

## Materials and Methods

Absorbed dose to the breast, lung, mediastinum, and skin was evaluated with an anthropomorphic phantom and radiophotoluminescence glass dosimeters using two different CT scanners. The dosimeters were placed inside and outside the phantom. The phantom was scanned using three-dimensional and _z_ -axis ATCM techniques after scanning localizer radiographs from the horizontal and vertical directions. After scanning, each organ dose was calculated. Moreover, the dose-length product recorded in the dose reports was examined, and each effective dose was calculated.

## Results

Compared with _z_ -axis ATCM, three-dimensional ATCM reduced breast dose by 0.7% to 18.6% and effective dose by 4.9% to 10.2%. In particular, three-dimensional ATCM reduced frontal breast dose. For other organs, three-dimensional ATCM reduced absorbed doses by 3.4% to 13.6% compared to _z_ -axis ATCM.

## Conclusion

Three-dimensional ATCM can reduce absorbed doses to the breast and other organs, in addition to reducing effective dose, compared to _z_ -axis ATCM.

Computed tomographic (CT) scans are the most effective examinations for detecting lung cancer at an early stage . With increased numbers of detector rows and faster gantry rotation times, the time required to scan the entire chest has been reduced to less than 5 seconds . Although multidetector-row computed tomography has been associated with higher radiation dose than conventional computed tomography, the introduction of automatic tube current modulation (ATCM) has facilitated the effective reduction of patient radiation dose while maintaining optimal image quality .

In this technique, tube current is automatically adjusted in the _x_ and _y_ planes (angular ATCM), the _z_ plane ( _z_ -axis ATCM), or both (three-dimensional ATCM) by inputting an appropriate noise value . Previous studies have shown that three-dimensional ATCM is the most effective in reducing patient radiation dose and could reduce the absorbed dose, particularly in the anterior and posterior parts of the body . Later, we envisioned the breast as one of the organs located in the anterior or posterior part of the body. The recently recommended tissue weighting factor for the breast reported in an International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) publication is higher than that previously recommended in an earlier ICRP publication . This implies that overexposure to the breast should be avoided, and three-dimensional ATCM can be used to achieve this objective.

The phantom was sliced into 14 pieces of 25 mm thickness, and each slice was drilled with holes to enable the insertion of the dosimeters in the position of each organ. The phantom was equipped with standard, close-fitting Mix D plugs and inserted in the holes. Each breast was molded into 20-mm-thick sections, and each slice was drilled with holes to enable the insertion of dosimeters or close-fitting Mix D plugs.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ChestCTPerformedwith3DandzAxisAutomaticTubeCurrentModulationTechnique/0_1s20S1076633208006806.jpg)
