## Rationale and Objectives

Few data were available regarding the underlying burden of specific plaque types with increasing ages. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship of coronary artery calcium (CAC) score with total coronary plaque burden and the difference of underlying coronary plaque composition across differing aging groups using 64-slice multidetector computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Multidetector computed tomographic images of 781 consecutive patients were evaluated using a 15–coronary segment model. Segment involvement score (the total number of segments with any plaque), segment stenosis score (the sum of maximal stenosis score per segment), total plaque score (the sum of the plaque amount per segment), and plaque composition were measured to compare with total CAC scores stratified by age tertile (lowest \[ _n_ = 274\], <55 years; middle \[ _n_ = 242\], 55–65 years; highest \[ _n_ = 265\], >65 years).

## Results

The mean age of the study population was 59 ± 13 years (481 men \[62%\]). With increasing age, higher segment involvement scores, segment stenosis scores, and total plaque scores were noted. Plaque burden was correlated significantly with total CAC scores in all tertiles. The percentage of partially calcified ( _P_ < .001) and calcified ( _P_ < .001) plaque increased with age, and in the highest age tertile, 87% of plaque contained calcium (calcified or mixed), compared to only 63% in the younger patients ( _P_ < .001). Those aged >65 years were highly unlikely to have isolated noncalcified plaque (in the setting of a calcium score of 0). Younger patients were 10 times more likely to have isolated noncalcified plaque ( _P_ < .001).

## Conclusions

The absence of CAC strongly excludes obstructive disease, and CAC predicts the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque. However, the absence of any CAC does not exclude the presence of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, especially in patients aged <55 years. Plaque composition shifted from noncalcified to calcified plaque with increasing age, which may affect the vulnerability of these lesions over time.

Assessment of coronary calcium is feasible and reproducible with the use of electron-beam computed tomography. More recently, it is easily quantified using multidetector computed tomographic (MDCT) imaging with well-standardized scores . Contrast-enhanced MDCT, noninvasively established to evaluate coronary artery stenosis, enables the identification of coronary plaque composition and plaque burden, with high spatial resolution as well .

Atherosclerotic plaque consists of a variety of amorphous materials, including fibrous debris, cholesterol, and matrix materials such as calcium, and is characterized by smooth muscle cell proliferation . Arterial calcium development is intimately associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaque as a part of coronary plaque . Although it has been reported that there is a strong correlation between coronary calcification and coronary atherosclerosis , coronary artery calcium (CAC) score may reflect only the portion of “calcified” plaque of coronary plaque burden. Moreover, several studies have reported nonobstructive disease or low rates of obstructive disease in patients without CAC and acute coronary events occurring in patients without CAC, most commonly in young smokers . Few data were available regarding the underlying burden of specific plaque types with increasing age. We hypothesized that CAC is correlated with total plaque better in an older population and that as plaque ages, more calcified plaque will be seen, significantly decreasing the noncalcified plaque.
