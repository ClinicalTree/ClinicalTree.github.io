In response to the significant advances in thoracic imaging over the past decade, authors Jannette Colins and Eric J. Stern have undertaken the task of updating their extremely successful first edition (published in 1999) with current images and information. The new edition includes nearly 800 images of superb quality, many of which replace images of older technology. Several chapters have been expanded to encompass up-to-date information, including the 2004 World Health Organization classification of lung tumors and the most recent classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. Several new chapters have been introduced, including a dedicated chapter on cardiac disease (Chapter 18), and new chapters on pulmonary vascular disease (Chapter 17) and the thoracic aorta (Chapter 19).

The second edition follows the 2005 Revised Cardiothoracic Radiology Curriculum for diagnostic radiology residents, developed by the Education Committee of the Society of Thoracic Radiology ( ). The first page of each chapter lists “learning objectives,” which are often identical in wording to the “knowledge-based objectives” found in the revised curriculum. The text itself begins with a concise summary of chest radiographic and axial computed tomographic anatomy, complemented by well-illustrated diagrams. This chapter serves as a helpful reference point for novice radiologists and nonradiologists as they continue reading through the book. For example, in Chapter 5, Monitoring and Support Devices—Tubes and Lines, there is an image of a central venous catheter tip extending into the azygos vein (Fig 5-2). Using the normal anatomy chapter as a reference, Fig 1-13 clearly shows the relationship of the azygos vein and the superior vena cava, helping to illustrate why a line may end up malpositioned in this way.

There are several chapters that make this book unique among chest radiology texts. For example, Chapter 2, Signs and Patterns of Lung Disease, consists of a collection of 20 processes with classic radiographic findings, each summarized with a paragraph of text and one or two “Aunt Minnie” type images. This certainly represents high-yield material for examinations or radiology case conferences. The chapter continues with a succinct description of common patterns in pulmonary disease, including honeycombing, septal thickening, cystic, nodular, ground glass, mosaic attenuation, and tree-in-bud. Another distinctive chapter is Chapter 5, Monitoring and Support Devices—Tubes and Lines. Chest radiographs are often used to confirm the position of an array of monitoring and support devices. Therefore, any health care professional involved in the placement of or interpretation of radiographs containing these devices must know their appropriate appearance. The authors do an excellent job summarizing the function of each device, the normal radiographic appearance, and the potential associated complications. Finally, Chapter 20, Self Assessment, includes 113 questions for readers to evaluate their comprehension of the topics and diseases presented throughout the book. Thirty-six of these questions are associated with images in a multiple choice format, with detailed answers addressing the correct diagnosis as well as why the other choices are incorrect.

The addition of dedicated chapters on cardiac disease (Chapter 18) and the thoracic aorta (Chapter 19) is a significant improvement to the original edition. The cardiac overview is well organized, beginning with congenital cardiac disease in adults, and continuing to include acquired heart disease, postoperative complications, complications of myocardial infarction, and pericardial disease. Major conditions of the thoracic aorta are discussed, including aortic dissection, intramural hematoma, penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, thoracic aortic aneurysm, and imaging of the repaired aorta. These chapters deviate somewhat from the ‘knowledge-based objectives’ of the revised radiology curriculum for cardiovascular imaging, focusing less on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. This appears intentional, perhaps to keep the text concise, as only two cardiac MR images and one MR image of the thoracic aorta are included.

The authors categorize some chapters by pattern of disease (eg, Interstitial Lung Disease \[Chapter 2\], Alveolar Lung Disease \[Chapter 3\]), whereas others are categorized by location (eg, Upper Lung Disease \[Chapter 10\] and Peripheral Lung Disease \[Chapter 12\]). Overall, this is an effective method, especially in forming differential diagnoses. Unavoidably, this categorization leads to redundant coverage of some conditions that can be classified by pattern or location. For example, Langerhans cell histiocytosis and silicosis are covered more than once.

A minor critique is the text lacks an overview of the current techniques in thoracic imaging. The preface includes among the target audience: residents on their first chest radiology rotation, internists, family practitioners, and other health care professionals. For this demographic, a clear explanation of the different techniques, for example, when intravenous contrast is indicated or what high-resolution computed tomography of the lung entails, would be useful.
