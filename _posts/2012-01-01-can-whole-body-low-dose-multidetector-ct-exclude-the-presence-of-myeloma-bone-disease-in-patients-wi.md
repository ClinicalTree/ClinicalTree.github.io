## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the benefit of using whole-body low-dose computed tomography (WBLD-CT) in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) for exclusion of multiple myeloma (MM) bone disease.

## Materials and Methods

Seventy-one consecutive patients with confirmed MGUS (as defined by the latest criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group) who underwent WBLD-CT for diagnosis were identified retrospectively by a search of our institution’s electronic medical record database (2002–2009). Patients were classified as low-risk or intermediate/high-risk and followed over a ≥2-year period with additional CT imaging and/or laboratory parameters. Presence of osteolysis, medullary, or extramedullary abnormalities compatible with involvement by MM was recorded. A diffuse or focal increase in medullary density to Hounsfield unit (HU) values >20 HU/>0 HU was considered suspicious for bone marrow infiltration if no other causes identifiable.

## Results

The presence of osteolysis was excluded in all 71 patients with MGUS at initial diagnosis and patients were surveilled for ≥2 years. Lytic changes were observed at follow-up in1/71 patients that progressed to MM and were detectable via WBLD-CT at an early stage (even before a significant rise in M-protein was recorded). In 3/71 patients with MGUS (4%) suspicious bone marrow attenuation values were measured, disclosing disease progression to smoldering myeloma in another patient and false-positive results in 2/71 patients. Bone marrow attenuation assessment resulted in a specificity and negative predictive value of 97%, respectively. No significant difference with respect to bone marrow attenuation was observed in patients with low-risk MGUS versus intermediate- to high-risk MGUS. One of 71 patients showed serologic disease progression to active MM without bone abnormalities detectable.

## Conclusion

WBLD-CT reliably excludes findings compatible with myeloma in MGUS and thereby complements hematologic laboratory analysis.

A total of 3.2% of the population age 50 years or older and 5.3% of persons older than 70 years present with a monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) . MGUS is defined as the presence of a monoclonal protein (M protein) in the serum at a concentration of <3 g/dL, an amount of <10% plasma cells in the bone marrow and no additional features of plasma cell disease, such as lytic bone lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal insufficiency . Because this premalignant condition consistently precedes multiple myeloma (MM) with an average 1% annual risk of progression, regular follow-up needs to be performed .

In MM the most widely used staging system is based on the Durie-Salmon criteria encompassing the presence of lytic bone lesions on radiographs, a decrease in hemoglobin, an increase in serum calcium, the amount of M protein, and renal function . However, because at least 30%–50% of the bone mass needs to be destructed for a lytic lesion to become apparent on a radiograph , a substantial number of MM lesions (both within bone and extraosseous) are missed by conventional radiography . Because low-dose computed tomography (CT) is a sensitive imaging tool for the detection of destructive bone lesions, we routinely perform a whole-body low-dose multidetector CT (WBLD-CT) at our institution to exclude lytic bone involvement in patients presenting with a monoclonal gammopathy . WBLD-CT enables an accurate assessment of osteolysis in the entire skeleton and allows for a concise evaluation of the appendicular and pelvic bone marrow including the less frequent extramedullary involvement . Several studies revealed focal bone marrow abnormalities in MGUS patients via magnetic resonance (MR) imaging leading to redivivus interest in the Durie-Salmon PLUS staging system , even though prediction of overall survival was not improved by the latter . No data exist in the current literature concerning the applicability and the relevance of WBLD-CT in patients with MGUS.

Thirteen months later (b) , bone marrow attenuation values increased to 30 HU even though the M-protein remained stable. However, progressive anemia resulting from drug toxicity from antidepressant medication was recorded and explained the reactive increase in bone marrow attenuation.
