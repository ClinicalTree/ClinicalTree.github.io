## Rationale and Objectives

Aim of the study was to compare between volumetric and unidimensional approaches for treatment response monitoring in a nude rat model of experimental bone metastases. For the volumetric approach, an automated segmentation algorithm of osteolytic lesions was introduced and compared to manual volumetry.

## Material and Methods

Nude rats bearing osteolytic metastases were treated with zoledronate and sunitinib and compared to controls. Treatment response was assessed longitudinally in vivo using flat-panel volumetric computed tomography at days 30, 35, 45, and 55 after tumor cell inoculation. The mean sizes and volumes of osteolytic lesions were determined according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and by automated and manual volumetry (software: MITK \[The Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit, Heidelberg, Germany\] and VIRTUOS, Heidelberg, Germany).

## Results

In contrary to RECIST, the manual volumetric approach indicated a significant decrease in osteolytic lesion volume in response to treatment. The presented automatic segmentation algorithm for treatment monitoring identified bone metastases adequately and assessed changes in the osteolytic lesion volume over time according to manual volumetry.

## Conclusions

In an animal model, volumetric treatment response assessment of osteolytic bone metastases is superior to unidimensional measurements, and automated volumetric segmentation may be a valuable alternative to manual volume determination.

Bone is the most common site of metastasis for breast and prostate cancer. Bone pain, pathologic fractures, and immobility are clinical complications of bone metastasis which can profoundly impair quality of life for long-term survivors . Treatment options for inhibiting breast cancer bone metastases are currently including the systemic treatment options bisphosphonates, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy. Furthermore, novel therapeutic approaches for metastatic breast cancer enclose antiangiogenic treatments .

Treatment response assessment of bone metastases is complicated because of the complex morphology of skeletal lesions and the slow turnover of bone matrix on therapy . Beside magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for evaluation of bone marrow involvement of metastasis, computed tomography (CT) is commonly used in clinical practice to determine morphologic osseous changes after application of treatment. The commonly used classification system for therapy monitoring in solid tumors is the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) that is based on unidimensional measurement of primary tumors and metastases as determined by the largest lesion diameter . Bone metastases, however, have been considered as “immeasurable” in the initial version of these guidelines because of the complex morphology . In the revised RECIST guidelines (version 1.1), some additions have been made defining osteolytic or mixed lesions with identifiable soft tissue masses as measurable lesions by CT and MRI . Thus, measuring unidimensional diameters of the soft tissue component of skeletal metastases is the current standard for response evaluation.
