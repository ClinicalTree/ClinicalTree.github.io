I look forward to serving as Editor-in-Chief of _Academic Radiology_ , the official journal of the Association of University Radiologists (AUR). The journal of the AUR started as _Investigative Radiology_ in 1966, with David Rockoff as the founding Editor-in-Chief. Subsequent Editors-in-Chief of _Investigative Radiology_ were Richard Greenspan (1976-1984), Charles Putman (1984-1989) and Bruce Hillman (1989-1995). In 1995, the AUR began to publish its own journal, _Academic Radiology_ . Bruce Hillman served during this transition and became the first Editor-in-Chief of _Academic Radiology_ . He was succeeded by Edmund (Tony) Franken (1997-2000). Stanley Baum, who has served as Editor-in-Chief since 2000, is stepping down after a long and very successful tenure.

The AUR, founded in 1953, has enjoyed 64 successful years, serving radiologists in a variety of academic settings, including university, multispecialty clinic, and private practice environments. The richness of the society derives from its members and participants at the annual meeting, where colleagues come together to discuss topics of mutual interest. The spirit is collaborative and the goal is improvement. The AUR includes many affinity groups and has a very close relationship with two independent organizations, the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments and the Association of Program Directors in Radiology.

Members of the Society of Chairs of Academic Radiology Departments are responsible for leading their departments and are interested in advancing all aspects of an academic practice. Program directors are primarily responsible for their residency training programs but often play many other important roles in the department, such as recruiting medical students into radiology, directing the resident selection committee, mentoring radiology house officers, and satisfying the requirements of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), a job that has become increasingly complex in recent years. Because directors of ACGME-approved fellowship programs must also comply with ACGME training requirements, residency program directors serve as valuable resources for them.

The affinity groups include the Alliance of Medical Student Educators in Radiology, the Alliance of Clinician-Educators in Radiology, and the Radiology Research Alliance. The American Alliance of Academic Chief Residents in Radiology reflects the many contributions radiology residents make to our academic community. Indeed, they are the future of our field. Among the most valuable people in an academic radiology department, and those who are essential to the residency training program, are the residency program coordinators. They have formed an affinity group, the Association of Program Coordinators in Radiology, closely aligned with the Association of Program Directors in Radiology.

Another affinity group, the Radiology Alliance of Health Services Researchers (RAHSR), began as the Society for Health Services Research in Radiology. RAHSR adds a dynamic element to the annual meeting, helping the society focus on the role medical imaging plays in health care and the future of our field. Members of RAHSR have played a prominent role in the AUR General Electric Radiology Research Academic Fellowship (GERRAF) award. Begun in 1992, the GERRAF award was created to develop a cadre of academic radiologists trained in clinical research methodology and patient-oriented, health services research. Each of the GERRAF fellows receives a stipend of $70,000 for 2 years and at least 50% unassigned time. Each GERRAF fellow develops a research plan with the help of a senior mentor. The research project is critiqued by the GERRAF Board of Review at an annual winter retreat. The Board has had three Chairs, Al Moss, Ron Arenson, and currently, Ruth Carlos, since its inception.

The AUR annual meeting provides a valuable forum for the dissemination of new information and discussion of topics of mutual interest in education, research, and administration. Attendance at the annual meeting has shown steady increases, which attests to the value of the meeting to its participants.
