This first-edition book is another source of board review cases for radiology residents and radiologists preparing for their recertifying examinations. Although the text provides 100 musculoskeletal cases, the accompanying online segment provides an additional 150 cases. The paperback book and online module together can be completed in only a day or two, with radiographic findings that are readily apparent and concise discussions of the cases and differential diagnoses.

Unlike other case review series, the book is not organized by body part, type of pathology, or case difficulty. Instead, the reader cannot predict what case will ensue, similar to the board style. However, unlike the board examination, the book does not provide supplementary questions to test the reader’s knowledge beyond image pattern recognition. Thus, the reader must be self-motivated to do more in his or her use of the cases than to simply make the diagnosis and provide differentials.

Images are of average quality in the textbook and excellent quality in the online module. The online module cases can be zoomed and viewed in full-screen mode. Findings are difficult to miss, which mirrors the board setting. There is a realistic mixture of magnetic resonance, computed tomographic, nuclear medicine, and plain-film radiographic images. All types of musculoskeletal pathology are included nearly evenly, although several topics were unnecessarily repeated, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis in the hands, fracture nonunion, neurofibromatosis, and developmental dysplasia of the hip.

Case discussion is brief and focuses on the most important differential diagnoses. Thus, the reader is not overwhelmed with long lists, rare diseases, or extraneous information. When no differential exists, the author is smart to decrease the differential list. The degree of difficulty is also appropriate, with only one or two cases too complex or lengthy.

Overall, this book is not to be used as the primary or sole musculoskeletal case-review book for senior residents and recertifying physicians. It is more of a supplement for those who need extra practice or who have a few extra days for preparation. The book is also useful for junior residents to ensure that they can recognize important musculoskeletal pathology and add to their knowledge base. The online case bank of 150 additional cases alone is worth the monetary investment.
