## Rationale and Objectives

To compare quality of ultra-low-dose thin-section computed tomography (CT) images of the lung reconstructed using model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) and adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) to filtered back projection (FBP) and to determine the minimum tube current–time product on MBIR images by comparing to standard-dose FBP images.

## Materials and Methods

Ten cadaveric lungs were scanned using 120 kVp and four different tube current–time products (8, 16, 32, and 80 mAs). Thin-section images were reconstructed using MBIR, three ASIR blends (30%, 60%, and 90%), and FBP. Using the 8-mAs data, side-to-side comparison of the four iterative reconstruction image sets to FBP was performed by two independent observers who evaluated normal and abnormal findings, subjective image noise, streak artifact, and overall image quality. Image noise was also measured quantitatively. Subsequently, 8-, 16-, and 32-mAs MBIR images were compared to standard-dose FBP images. Comparisons of image sets were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction.

## Results

At 8 mAs, MBIR images were significantly better ( _P_ < .005) than other reconstruction techniques except in evaluation of interlobular septal thickening. Each set of low-dose MBIR images had significantly lower ( _P_ < .001) subjective and objective noise and streak artifacts than standard-dose FBP images. Conspicuity and visibility of normal and abnormal findings were not significantly different between 16-mAs MBIR and 80-mAs FBP images except in identification of intralobular reticular opacities.

## Conclusions

MBIR imaging shows higher overall quality with lower noise and streak artifacts than ASIR or FBP imaging, resulting in nearly 80% dose reduction without any degradations of overall image quality.

The increase of the radiation dose delivered in computed tomography (CT) has recently been a problem. Because there is a trade-off between image quality and radiation dose on CT, however, it is not always appropriate to decrease radiation dose on CT. Iterative reconstruction algorithms for CT have been developed by multiple equipment manufacturers to reduce image noise associated with radiation dose reduction . Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) are types of iterative reconstruction algorithms available on clinical settings. The ASIR technique models photon and electronic noise statistics; by partially correcting for fluctuations in projection measurements due to limited photon statistics, ASIR enables a time-efficient reduction in pixel variance that is statistically unlikely to be representative of anatomic features resulting in a reduction of image noise with no decrement in spatial resolution . In clinical practice, ASIR is typically used in combination with the standard filtered back projection (FBP) reconstruction to create blended images. As compared to ASIR, MBIR is a more mathematically complex and time-consuming technique as it models not only system statistics but also system optics . Phantom experiments show that MBIR has potential to improve spatial resolution and allow further reductions in image noise . To date, few studies have evaluated CT image quality of the lung using MBIR . Thus, unlike FBP and ASIR, MBIR technique might have the potential not to degrade image quality even under the extreme dose reduction. McCollough et al. reported that the advances in data acquisition, image reconstruction, and optimization processes that were identified by consensus as being necessary to achieve submillisievert-dose CT examinations. It is expected that MBIR might be one of techniques to enable a submillisievert-dose CT. The present study was performed using cadaveric lung models that can provide multiple acquisitions to determine the minimum tube current–time product at which image quality of a low-dose MBIR study is comparable to that of a standard-dose FBP study. The aim of this present study was two-fold: to compare quality of ultra-low-dose thin-section CT images of the lung reconstructed using MBIR and ASIR to FBP and to determine the minimum tube current–time product at which image quality of an MBIR study is comparable to that of a standard-dose FBP.

## Materials and methods

## Cadaveric Lungs and Imaging

We obtained approval from our internal Ethics Review Board. Informed consent was obtained for the use of patient biomaterial and for retrospective review of patient records and images. Ten cadaveric lungs were inflated and fixed by the method of Heitzman . These lungs were distended through the main bronchus with fixative fluid that contained polyethylene glycol 400, 95% ethyl alcohol, 40% formalin, and water in the proportions of 10:5:2:3. The specimens were immersed in fixative for 2 days and the lungs were then air dried. The pathologic diagnoses of these 10 lungs were usual interstitial pneumonia ( _n_ = 1), diffuse alveolar damage ( _n_ = 1), diffuse panbronchiolitis ( _n_ = 1), pneumonia ( _n_ = 2), emphysema ( _n_ = 1), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ( _n_ = 1), metastatic disease ( _n_ = 2), and lymphangitic carcinomatosis ( _n_ = 1).
