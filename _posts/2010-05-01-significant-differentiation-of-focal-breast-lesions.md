## Rationale and Objectives

Initial data suggest that elastography can improve the specificity of ultrasound in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions. The aim of this study was to compare elastography and B-mode ultrasound to determine whether the calculation of strain ratios (SRs) can further improve the differentiation of focal breast lesions.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 227 women with histologically proven focal breast lesions (113 benign, 114 malignant) were included at two German breast centers. The women underwent a standardized ultrasound procedure using a high-end ultrasound system with a 9-MHz broadband linear transducer. B-mode scans and sonoelastograms were analyzed by two experienced readers using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System criteria. SRs were calculated from a tumor-adjusted region of interest (mean color pixel density) and a comparable region of interest placed in the lateral fatty tissue. Sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values were calculated for SRs (receiver-operating characteristic analysis).

## Results

The women had a mean age of 54 years (range, 19–87 years). The mean lesion diameter was 1.6 ± 0.9 cm. Sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 56% for B-mode scanning, 81% and 89% for elastography, and 90% and 89% for SRs. An SR cutoff value of 2.45 (area under the curve, 0.949) allowed significant differentiation ( _P_ < .001) of malignant (mean, 5.1 ± 4.2) and benign (mean, 1.6 ± 1.0) lesions. The quantitative method of SR calculation was superior to subjective interpretation of sonoelastograms and B-mode scans, with a positive predictive value of 89% compared to 68% and 84% for the other two methods.

## Conclusions

Calculation of SRs contributes to the standardization of sonoelastography with high sensitivity and allows significant differentiation of benign and malignant breast lesions with higher specificity compared to B-mode ultrasound but not elastography.

Elasticity is an important property of biologic tissues that changes with age and in the presence of pathology. It is defined as the elongation (stretching) of tissue under strain. Elasticity therefore is a measure of the amount of pressure that needs to be applied to induce elastic deformation of the tissue . Tissue elasticity can be visualized by sonoelastography, an imaging modality based on the analysis of ultrasound information . Numerous studies have recently shown that information on tissue elasticity has clinical benefit in the diagnostic evaluation of different organ systems . Several investigators have shown that elastography can improve specificity in characterizing focal breast lesions . Elastography is the visualization of tissue properties traditionally evaluated by palpation, which is an established clinical technique to characterize focal breast lesions. Studies investigating breast sonoelastography have focused on lesions that are notoriously difficult to characterize, namely, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3 and 4 lesions and lesions occurring in the presence of lipomatous involution. If sonoelastography can identify true benign lesions in women with indeterminate lesions on the basis of other diagnostic modalities, this new technique might in the future obviate the need for histologic confirmation in these cases .

Sonoelastographic information can be obtained by real-time scanning or by offline analysis . In so-called strain imaging, the change in tissue elasticity under compression is calculated, and the information is color coded and superimposed on B-mode images. This method is limited by a lack of standardization. Elastic properties can be described quantitatively by calculating strain ratios (SR). We therefore conducted a prospective study to investigate whether the calculation of SRs can also improve the differentiation of focal breast lesions. This was done by comparing SRs with B-mode ultrasound and conventional sonoelastography.
