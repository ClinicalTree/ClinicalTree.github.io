## Rationale and Objectives

The start of call is a stressful time for radiology residents. Traditional teaching methods are not ideal for call preparation because they are radically different than the task performed on call. The purpose of this study is to determine if a computer-based radiology simulator would have an effect on resident confidence level or diagnostic abilities.

## Materials and Methods

A simulator was created to mimic the picture archive and communication system (PACS) at our hospital. Typical call-level cases were selected, anonymized, and entered into the database. The first-year residents were randomly split into a control group and a study group that used the simulator. Each resident took a survey 1 month before and after beginning call to measure his or her subjective feeling of preparedness and nervousness. Objective measures were also obtained through the use of discordance levels from on-call cases.

## Results

Seventy-one cases were entered into the simulator. Of the 12 residents in the first-year class, 7 were placed in the study group and 5 in the control group. The residents in both groups claimed they felt more prepared and less nervous 1 month after starting call. The differences at survey were not significant, but the residents in the study group trended toward feeling more prepared and less nervous. There was no statistical difference in the discordance rates for on-call cases between the two groups.

## Conclusions

Although statistical significance was not reached between the users of the radiology simulator and the control group, there was a subjective feeling that the simulator was useful for call preparation and as an interactive learning tool. A larger sample study group size may show statistical significance.

The onset of call is a scary milestone for most new radiologists. Residency programs use a variety of methods to help prepare their residents for this task, including lectures, specific core rotations, mini-call, case conferences, and reviews of teaching files. While each method helps prepare the resident for specific topics that may arise on call, none simulates the actual activity of call: reading cases independently. To address this deficiency, an on-call simulator was created.

Simulators have a long history of use in both medicine and aviation for education and training purposes; however, most simulators teach a particular skill or skill set. Medical simulators have been used most extensively in surgery and anesthesiology, but they are also used in other fields such as ophthalmology and gastroenterology ( ). Simulators in radiology have recently been developed for perfecting ultrasound and vascular interventional technique ( ). Previously, other simulator programs have been described, but on a limited scale ( ). Because much of modern radiology is performed digitally, radiology is uniquely situated within medicine for the seamless integration of simulators.

Please note that the faculty does not need to judge each case. The percent of cases in which the faculty agreed with the resident is determined by dividing the total number of cases the faculty agreed with the resident by the total number of cases judged. The percent of cases the resident received a mild or significant discordance was determined by dividing the total number of cases that the resident received a specific type of discordance by the total number of cases viewed. Because the denominator is different, the percentages do not add up to 100%.
