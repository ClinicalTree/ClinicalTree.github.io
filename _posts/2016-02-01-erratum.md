Erratum to “Quantitative Determination of Liver Triglyceride Levels with 3T  1 H-MR Spectroscopy in Mice with Moderately Elevated Liver Fat Content”

\[Acad Radiol 21 (2014) 1446–1454\]

Jurgen H. Runge, MD, Pieter J. Bakker, MSc, Ingrid C. Gaemers, MSc, PhD, Joanne Verheij, MD, PhD, Theo B. M. Hakvoort, MSc, PhD, Roel of Ottenhoff, BSc, Jaap Stoker, MD, PhD, Aart J. Nederveen, PhD

From the Departments of Radiology (J.H.R., J.S., A.J.N.) and Pathology (P.J.B., J.V.), Tytgat Institute for Liver and Intestinal Research (I.C.G., T.B.M.H.) and the Department of Medical Biochemistry (R.O.) Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, PB 22660, 1100 DD Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The authors regret that on page 1447 the following sentence was not updated. “These mice have previously been described in an article focusing on the individual correlation of two histologic and three MR-based with biochemical liver fat content in mice with moderately elevated liver triglyceride content (blinded _for peer review_ ).” The sentence should be “These mice have previously been described in an article focusing on the individual correlation of two histologic and three MR-based with biochemical liver fat content in mice with moderately elevated liver triglyceride content (14).”

The authors would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused.
