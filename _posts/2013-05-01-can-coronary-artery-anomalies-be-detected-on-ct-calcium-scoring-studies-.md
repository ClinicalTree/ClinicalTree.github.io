## Purpose

To determine whether coronary artery anomalies can be detected on noncontrast computed tomography (CT) coronary artery calcium scoring (CCS) studies.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 126 patients (mean age 62 years; 35 women) underwent noncontrast CCS and contrast enhanced coronary CT angiography (cCTA). Thirty-three patients were diagnosed with a coronary anomaly on cCTA, whereas coronary anomalies were excluded in 93. Two observers (reader 1 \[R1\] and reader 2 \[R2\]), blinded to patient information independently evaluated each CCS study for: 1) visibility of coronary artery origins, 2) detection of coronary anomalies, and 3) benign or malignant (ie, interarterial) course. Using cCTA as the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of CCS studies for detecting coronary anomalies were calculated.

## Results

Of the 33 coronary anomalies, 16 were benign and 17 malignant. Based on noncontrast CCS studies, R1 and R2 correctly identified the left main origin in 123/126 (97.6%) and 121/126 (96%) patients; the left anterior descending origin in 125/126 (99.2%) and 122/126 (96.8%); the circumflex origin in 120/126 (95.2%) and 105/126 (83.3%); and the right coronary artery origin in 117/126 (92.9%) and 103/126 (81.7%), respectively. R1 and R2 identified 34 and 27 coronary anomalies and classified 19 and 15 as malignant, respectively. Interobserver reproducibility for detection of coronary anomalies was good (k = 0.76). Interobserver agreement for detection of malignant variants was even stronger (k = 0.80). On average, coronary artery anomalies were diagnosed with 85.2% sensitivity, 96.4% specificity, 90.5% PPV, and 94.1% NPV on noncontrast CCS studies.

## Conclusion

Benign and malignant coronary artery anomalies can be detected with relatively high accuracy on noncontrast-enhanced CCS studies. CCS studies should be reviewed for signs of coronary artery anomalies in order to identify malignant variants with possible impact on patient management.

The anatomy of the coronary arteries is not always predictable. Normal coronary anatomy is defined by a left coronary artery (LCA) and a right coronary artery (RCA) originating from the left and right aortic sinus, respectively. Coronary artery anomalies are variants rarely observed in the common population. Some are classified as benign while others—malignant types—can be life-threatening. Anomalies of the coronary arteries can be defined by their origin, course, or termination . Other variants such as anomalies of intrinsic coronary arterial anatomy (eg, congenital ostial stenosis, coronary aneurysms) were not subject of this study. Prognostically important variants, sometimes referred to as “malignant” anomalies, take an interarterial proximal course between the main pulmonary artery and the aorta. This path is subject to compression—especially during exercise—whereas “benign” coronary artery anomalies (non-interarterial, eg, retro-aortic course) do not carry such risk . Specific examples of interarterial coronary anomalies include an anomalous origin of the LCA from the RCA or right coronary sinus, or the anomalous origin of the RCA from the LCA or left coronary sinus. A common example of an anomaly not associated with possible myocardial ischemia is the circumflex artery (Cx) originating from the right coronary sinus without interarterial course.

Malignant coronary artery anomalies have been linked with chest pain, sudden death, cardiomyopathy, syncope, dyspnea, arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and myocardial infarction . The prevalence of these anomalies in society is estimated to be at or less than 1% but that number may be misleading because of the number of asymptomatic patients that go undiagnosed . Some studies suggest that sudden cardiac death is caused by malignant coronary artery anomalies in upwards of 12% of cases .
