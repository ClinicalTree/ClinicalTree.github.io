## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the maximum intensity projection (MIP) images generated at a multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanner console using advanced tools at a three-dimensional (3D) workstation for assessment of pancreatic tumor resectability.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval and informed consent wavier were obtained for this retrospective study. The intraoperative findings were used as reference standard. Two radiologists assessed console MIPs that were created using computed tomographic (CT) data sets of 30 patients (17 men and 13 women; age range, 35–79 years; mean age, 58 years) operated for pancreatic tumors. Semi-automated MIP images were created on a separate MDCT console. Two blinded radiologist (R1, R2) and surgeons (S1, S2) evaluated the image data independently for vascular involvement and tumor resectability. The image quality and diagnostic confidence for MIPs were graded on a 5-point scale (1 = poor, 2 = suboptimal, 3 = intermediate, 4 = good; 5 = excellent) and comparison was made with 3D workstation image scores.

## Results

The findings revealed greater than 90% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting involvement of peripancreatic vessels by pancreatic tumor with an excellent interobserver agreement (κ = 0.87–1.00). The findings of console-generated MIPs were same as the findings of 3D workstation images. The mean of image quality and diagnostic confidence grading for console MIPs by assessors were 4.4 and 4.2, respectively. The average time to generate simple MIPs at the console was 3.4 minutes (range, 2.3–4.4) compared to 26 minutes (range, 18–33) to create images at the 3D workstation.

## Conclusion

Semi-automated MIPs generated from an MDCT scanner console is an excellent alternative to 3D workstation images for assessing resectability of pancreatic tumor based on vascular involvement. Console MIPs can be quickly generated during the time of scan and thus can improve CT workflow.

Computed tomography (CT) is highly reliable for tumor staging and the determination of resectability and prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma ( ). It is critical to ensure that potentially resectable or unresectable tumors be correctly identified to appropriately present either surgical options in resectable patients or curative alternatives in unresectable cases.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) provides technical advantages such as shorter image acquisition time and isotropic voxel resolution ( ). In addition, post-processed two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) images, such as maximum intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering (VR) from MDCT scans, are superior and facilitate more accurate assessment of tumor resectability ( ). Previous studies have revealed that greater than 50% encasement of the portal vein (PV) or the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) by the pancreatic tumor with or without its compression is suggestive of vessel involvement, and MIP images obtained perpendicular to the axis of the PV provides a better plane to assess vessel involvement ( ).
