## Rationale and Objectives

To prospectively analyze the correlation between parameters of liver perfusion from technetium  99m -macroaggregates of albumin (  99m Tc-MAA) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with those obtained from dynamic CT perfusion in patients with primary or metastatic liver malignancy.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five consecutive patients (11 women, 14 men; mean age 60.9 ± 10.8; range: 32–78 years) with primary ( _n_ = 5) or metastatic ( _n_ = 20) liver malignancy planned to undergo selective internal radiotherapy underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced CT liver perfusion imaging (four-dimensional spiral mode, scan range 14.8 cm, 15 scans, cycle time 3 seconds) and  99m Tc-MAA SPECT after intraarterial injection of 180 MBq  99m Tc–MAA on the same day. Data were evaluated by two blinded and independent readers for the parameters arterial liver perfusion (ALP), portal venous perfusion (PVP), and total liver perfusion (TLP) from CT, and the  99m Tc-MAA uptake-ratio of tumors in relation to normal liver parenchyma from SPECT.

## Results

Interreader agreements for quantitative perfusion parameters were high for dynamic CT ( _r_ = 0.90–0.98, each _P_ < .01) and  99m Tc -MAA SPECT ( _r_ = 0.91, _P_ < .01). Significant correlation was found between  99m Tc-MAA uptake ratio and ALP ( _r_ = 0.7, _P_ < .01) in liver tumors. No significant correlation was found between  99m Tc-MAA uptake ratio, PVP ( _r_ = −0.381, _P_ = .081), and TLP ( _r_ = 0.039, _P_ = .862).

## Conclusion

This study indicates that in patients with primary and metastatic liver malignancy, ALP obtained by dynamic CT liver perfusion significantly correlates with the  99m Tc-MAA uptake ratio obtained by SPECT.

Selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) with radioembolization of yttrium-90 (  90 Y) microspheres is a catheter-based, liver-directed therapy that has gained recent acceptance for the treatment of primary and metastatic liver malignancies not qualifying for surgery .  90 Y microspheres are selectively injected via the hepatic artery and preferentially flow into tumor areas with a high arterial vascularization , whereas normal liver parenchyma, which is predominantly perfused over the portal venous system, is not affected . This allows administration of high radiation doses to tumors, whereas radiation exposure of normal liver parenchyma remains tolerably low.

To assess distribution of radiolabeled microspheres and to minimize side effects resulting from microsphere deposition in normal liver parenchyma, the lung, or the gastrointestinal tract, an angiography study is routinely performed before SIRT, and a tracer dose of technetium  99m -labeled macroaggregates of albumin (  99m Tc-MAA) is injected via the hepatic artery with the catheter tip in treatment position to simulate the distribution of the therapeutic agent . Immediately after angiography, a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is performed showing the distribution of  99m Tc-MAA particles, which demonstrates perfusion patterns of the normal and diseased liver parenchyma and indicates potential shunting to the lung and gastrointestinal tract .
