In 2006, more than 70 million computed tomographic (CT) scans were performed in the United States alone. From its inception in 1973, CT technology has been changing rapidly with constant improvements in x-ray production, detectors, slip gantry, and postprocessing. It has become an essential diagnostic tool with varied applications, so understanding CT imaging is important not only to radiologists but also to referring physicians and medical students. Although there are a number of websites that provide free instruction on CT interpretation, very few of them are as up-to-date, user friendly, or detailed as this book. This edition of the manual includes protocols and dosimetry for state-of-the-art technology such as 4-, 6-, 16-, and 64-slice CT and dual-source CT, making it a worthy purchase even if you own the second edition. With thinner slices, CT images are becoming isotropic, and sagittal, coronal, and multiplanar reformatting is becoming a routine practice. The third edition of the CT teaching manual covers these new aspects, where relevant. The increasing use of CT in clinical practice places a greater responsibility on the radiologist to limit the patients' exposure to radiation. The chapter on dose reduction addresses these concerns by providing strategies to help keep the dose as low as reasonably achievable.

This manual has a number of strengths. The provision of tools, such as lists of abbreviations, keys for localizing anatomic structures, checklists for interpreting images, and multiple tables, enhances the learning process. The quality of the images is superb, and the fundamentals of CT, acquisition, reconstruction, postprocessing, and display are written in a clear and concise manner. Instruction regarding the use of oral and intravenous contrast, associated adverse reactions, and their management is also provided in a comprehensible way. The Test Yourself section and blank pages for notes are handy features that will help reinforce concepts.

To quote customer reviews: “There is no better book on the market for cross sectional anatomy … .” “This would make it perfect for radiology or surgery residents.” “This book has impressed everyone in my department. Docs and techs alike been impressed by it.” “It is affordable, not too big and packed with great images.”

The teaching manual, as quoted in the backpage, is ideally suited for medical students, technologists, referring physicians, and junior radiology residents. An advertisement from a vendor is the negative thing I found in this manual; I personally believe that there is no place for advertisements in a textbook or a teaching manual.
