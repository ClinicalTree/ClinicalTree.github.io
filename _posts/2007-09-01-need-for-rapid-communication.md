Authors are frequently frustrated by the long lead-time between the submission of articles and their subsequent publication. Acad Radiol has attempted to decrease this time but it still takes on average 22 days for the authors to be notified as to the decision of the reviewers and the editorial office. The process is further prolonged by the time it takes for the author’s revisions to be made and returned. Once the editorial office accepts the revised paper it takes an additional 3–4 months before the manuscript is published.

In an attempt to decrease the time between submission and publication of selected manuscripts, Acad Radiol is introducing a new category of papers that will appear under the heading “Rapid Communications”. These papers will be showcased and placed in the journal immediately following the editorial. The articles are meant to be short, exciting, and timely describing new techniques or observations that have the potential of having a major impact on the science of biomedical imaging. Articles on new techniques ( ) and new observations ( ) are frequently published in the journal. However the lead time from submission to publication has generally been more than six months.

Those submitting papers to this new section of the journal should conform to the Rapid Communication Instructions as they appear on our web site. The manuscripts must be brief with a limit of 4000 words including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, results, discussion, conclusion and figure legends. References should not exceed 20 and the paper should have less than 4 tables or figures. If these rules are followed the published version of the paper will not exceed 5 printed pages. In addition, the rapid communication article should have an additional concise summary page that succinctly addresses the type and novelty of the contribution and comparison to existing state of the art techniques or observations. This summary page will not be included in the word count.

Authors submitting manuscripts on our website are asked to select an Article Type from a pull-down menu (see illustration below). Papers to be considered for this new section must select “Rapid Communication” as the Article Type.

When submitting the “Rapid Communication” manuscript to Elsevier Editorial System, authors need to provide an electronic version of their manuscript. Word is the preferred format for manuscript text and tables; Files can also be submitted in LaTeX format, provided that they are prepared in accordance with the Elsevier LaTeX package. LaTeX file guidelines can be found in the “Guide to publishing with Elsevier” at  http://www.elsevier.com/authors . Because LaTeX files must be converted for the Journal’s production process, authors whose articles are accepted are urged to check their article proofs carefully.
