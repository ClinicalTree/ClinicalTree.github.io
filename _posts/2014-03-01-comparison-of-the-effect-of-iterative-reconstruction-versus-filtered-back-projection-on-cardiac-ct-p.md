## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the impact of iterative reconstruction in image space (IRIS) on image noise, image quality (IQ), and postprocessing at coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) compared to traditional filtered back-projection (FBP).

## Materials and Methods

The cCTA results of 50 patients (26 men; 58 ± 15 years, body mass index 31.5 ± 6.7 kg/m²) were investigated using a second-generation dual-source computed tomography system. Scan data were reconstructed with the use of IRIS and FBP algorithms. Two radiologists independently evaluated the reconstructions using automated coronary tree analysis software. Image noise was measured and IQ was rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The number of manual corrections after automated vessel segmentation, the time required to complete segmentation, and the number of missed segments were assessed in both IRIS and FBP reconstructions. Results were compared using paired _t-test_ .

## Results

IRIS significantly reduced image noise compared to FBP (23.3 ± 8.8 vs. 33.5 ± 13.5 Hounsfield units, _P_ < .001). Subjective IQ improved with IRIS (IRIS 3.2 ± 1.0 vs. FBP 3.0 ± 1.0, _P_ < .05). IRIS decreased the time needed for coronary segmentation from 111.9 ± 40.5 seconds to 95.2 ± 38.2 seconds with FBP ( _P_ < .01) and required fewer manual corrections (5.7 ± 3.0 vs. 6.8 ± 3.6, _P_ < .01). The number of missed vessel segments was not significantly different (3.6 ± 1.8 vs. 3.8 ± 1.9, _P_ > .05) between IRIS and FBP, respectively.

## Conclusions

During cCTA postprocessing, IRIS significantly decreases the time and the number of manual corrections for a complete coronary segmentation compared to FBP. This effect is likely attributable to suppression of image noise by IRIS, which improves the performance of automated vessel segmentation and positively impacts cCTA analysis.

Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) has emerged as a powerful noninvasive modality for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with low-to-intermediate pretest likelihood . The thin sections used to evaluate small coronary details at cCTA are inherently more susceptible to increased image noise than are thicker-section routine body examinations. Due to the well-known tradeoffs between radiation dose, image noise, and spatial resolution, low-dose radiation protocols aggravate this relationship and possibly lower diagnostic image quality. .

A mainstay of contemporary cCTA image interpretation is image postprocessing using dedicated analysis software for generating curved multiplanar reformats (cMPR) of the vessel course and for addressing other diagnostic aspects obtainable from cCTA. Inaccurate attenuation classification of voxels due to image noise holds the potential to interfere with successful postprocessing, which requires time-consuming manual adjustments. Many studies have investigated the use of postprocessing technique, reconstruction method, and automated and semiautomated segmentation software across a variety of fields and organ systems and with different modalities to determine the possible benefits that can be achieved .

IRIS generates a master image from the raw data, which will be used as the reference image from thereon. The correction algorithm then reduces image noise using a regularization term based on several image characteristics to improve border definition and maintain image sharpness. All image corrections are performed in the image space, which allows for faster iterative reconstruction because the reference image is the master reconstruction rather than the raw data (8) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ComparisonoftheEffectofIterativeReconstructionversusFilteredBackProjectiononCardiacCTPostprocessing/0_1s20S1076633213005412.jpg)
