## Rationale and Objectives

When evaluating ischemic stroke on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), the display method has not been investigated. The purpose of this study was to determine whether standardization of the display method for DWI affects observers' diagnostic performance in detecting ischemic stroke on DWI.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-six observers evaluated 40 DWI studies in 20 patients with acute (<6 hours) middle cerebral arterial strokes and 20 controls for the presence of hyperintense lesions in 10 areas using the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) system and one area in the corona radiata using a modified version of the ASPECTS system (ASPECTS-DWI). The images were reviewed using a standardized display method (SDM) and a conventional display method (CDM). The reading time was recorded for each session. The observers' performance was evaluated with receiver-operating characteristic analysis.

## Results

In all observers with ASPECTS-DWI scores of ≤8 points, the value of the mean average area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was slightly higher for the SDM than the CDM, but the difference was not statistically significant. In the insular ribbon, diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher with the SDM than the CDM ( _P_ = .036). In the other locations, there were no significant differences. With the SDM, the mean reading time was reduced by 7.5 seconds ( _P_ = .024).

## Conclusion

The SDM improved diagnostic accuracy for the insular ribbon and shortened the reading time, although it did not improve observers' performance with the ASPECTS-DWI system.

With respect to the detection and localization of ischemic stroke, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) yields good interrater homogeneity and better sensitivity and accuracy than computed tomography, even among raters with limited experience . In patients with ischemic strokes, tissue plasminogen activator improves outcomes and yields benefits, as long as administration is begun within 9 hours of the insult . Perfusion-DWI mismatch and clinical-DWI mismatch have been used as diagnostic criteria for thrombolytic therapy . In the evaluation of the extent of ischemic areas, the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS) system has been applied to DWI . The interpretation of the extent of acute ischemic lesions on DWI is crucial for estimating tissues at risk and for determining treatment.

Because DWI display conditions such as the window width and level vary among subjects, operators, and magnetic resonance scanners , there is a risk for missing acute ischemic lesions and misinterpreting normal brain regions as infarcted. To our knowledge, the possible effect of the display method on the diagnostic performance of raters evaluating DWI in patients with ischemic strokes has not been studied in detail.

A hyperintense lesion (asterisk) is seen in the lentiform (L) and corona radiata (CR). Because the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was allotted 11 points on the basis of the ASPECTS-DWI system, the ASPECTS-DWI score was 9 points in this case.

where SI  b0 is the SI in the normal-appearing thalamus on b0 images . For the SDM, one neuroradiologist (T. Hirai) manually measured the SI of the normal-appearing thalamus on b0 images with a circular region of interest (ROI); on each scan, one 60-mm  2 ROI was placed within the thalamus (  Fig 3 ). The measured window width and level were applied to all DWI studies for the SDM.
