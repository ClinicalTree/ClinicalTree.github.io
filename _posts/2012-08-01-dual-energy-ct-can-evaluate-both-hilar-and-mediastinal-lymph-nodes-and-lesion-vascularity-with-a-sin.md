## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate whether 80-kVp and weighted-average 120-kVp computed tomographic (CT) images scanned at 60 seconds after contrast material injection using a dual-source CT scanner could substitute for conventional 120-kVp images obtained at 30 and 100 seconds.

## Materials and Methods

Eighty-three consecutive patients with suspected lung cancer were enrolled. Images were obtained in dual-energy mode (80 and 140 kVp) at 60 seconds and conventional 120-kVp mode at 30 and 100 seconds after contrast injection. The CT numbers of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, hilar zone lymph nodes, and pulmonary lesions were measured. Contrasts between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes and beam-hardening artifacts were visually evaluated using five-point and four-point scales, respectively. The degree of enhancement was evaluated on 30-second 120-kVp, 100-second 120-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images.

## Results

The mean differences in attenuation between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes on the 30-second 120-kVp, 60-second 80-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images were 184/155, 130/140, and 84/92 Hounsfield units, respectively (all _P_ values <.001). The mean contrast scores for the hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes were 4.5/4.7, 3.7/4.2, 3.3/3.6, and 2.4/2.5 for these three and for 100-second 120-kVp images, respectively (all _P_ values <.01). The mean artifact scores of the four images were 1.2, 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0, respectively. On 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images, 55 of 60 lesions (92%) showed higher enhancement than on 100-second conventional 120-kVp images.

## Conclusions

Dual-energy CT images scanned 60 seconds after contrast injection show excellent vessel–lymph node contrast and enhancement of lesions and can replace dual-phase scan protocols.

Evaluation of metastases to regional lymph nodes (LNs) is very important to predict the prognoses of patients with lung cancer and to establish treatment strategies. Contrast-enhanced (CE) computed tomographic (CT) imaging is the standard modality for this purpose. It has been reported that scanning soon after contrast material injection (eg, 30 seconds) is appropriate for clearly depicting the hilar and mediastinal LN . However, this is too early to evaluate the contrast enhancement of pulmonary lesions such as neoplasms, inflammations, and tuberculomas. At our institution, therefore, postcontrast scans have been performed twice: at an early phase (30 seconds) to evaluate the LNs and at a late phase (100 seconds) to evaluate the vascularity of lesions. However, it is desirable that both demands be fulfilled with a single scan.

With a dual-energy (DE) CT scanner, images at low and high tube voltages can be obtained at one time. Using a low tube voltage, the contrast between iodinated contrast medium and surrounding tissues becomes larger because iodine provides greater x-ray attenuation, caused by the increase in its relative atomic number ( _Z_ = 53) upon exposure to reduced x-ray energy . The photoelectric effect in x-ray attenuation increases at lower tube voltages, particularly in scans of structures with high effective atomic numbers. Because of Compton scattering, most x-rays interact to a lesser extent with soft tissue as tube voltage increases. Therefore, tube voltage reduction leads to an increase in the attenuation of calcified structures and iodinated contrast material as the photoelectric effect increases and Compton scattering decreases. Consequently, as the k-edge of iodine is closer to the reduced voltage, beam attenuation is increased, and higher attenuation readings are obtained . It has been reported that chest multi–detector row CT scans at low tube voltages can reduce radiation dose, with images showing improved contrast enhancement . On the other hand, CT images scanned at low tube voltages result in reduced quality by increasing the level of noise and artifacts. Increases in image noise with the use of lower tube voltages lead to a direct reduction in photon flux , but no significant differences have been reported in image noise and radiation dose between single-energy acquisition and weighted-average 120-kVp DE images generated from a combination of 80-kVp and 140-kVp images .
