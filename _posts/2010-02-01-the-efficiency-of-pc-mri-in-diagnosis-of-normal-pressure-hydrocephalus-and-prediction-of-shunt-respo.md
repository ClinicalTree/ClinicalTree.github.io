## Rationale and Objectives

In this prospective study, we aimed to reveal the efficiency of phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) in the diagnosis of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (INPH) and prediction of shunt response.

## Materials and Methods

The study group consisted of 43 patients with INPH diagnosis and 15 asymptomatic age-matched controls. PC-MRI studies were applied on cerebral aqueduct and superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in all the cases.

## Results

The maximum and mean cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow velocities were significantly higher in the INPH patients compared with the controls ( _P_ < .05). CSF stroke volume (43.2 ± 63.8 μL) and output/min (3921 ± 5668 μL) were remarkably higher in the NPH group compared with the control group (3.9 ± 3.9 μL, 439 ± 487 μL, respectively) ( _P_ < .05). Maximum and mean venous velocity values of the INPH patients (maximum, 19.2 ± 4.3 cm/s; mean, 16 ± 3.7 cm/s), were lower than those of the control group (maximum, 21.8 ± 4.6 cm/s; mean, 18.9 ± 3.9 cm/s) ( _P_ < .05). Stroke volume and venous output/min values of INPH patients in SSS, were significantly lower than those of the control group ( _P_ < .001, _P_ = .007, respectively). The response of INPH patients against shunt treatment showed no statistical correlation with any of the PC-MRI parameters ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusion

The measurement of CSF venous flow velocities with PC-MRI is a noninvasive test that benefits INPH diagnosis, but remains inadequate in prediction of response against shunt treatment.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) demonstrates a normal initial pressure during lumbar puncture and follows a course including hydrocephalus and certain symptoms (dementia, gait disorder, urinary incontinence) . It is a rarer cause of cognitive deficits, responsible for 0%–5% of all dementia, but is probably being underestimated partly because of inconsistent definitions . Imaging reveals ventriculomegaly and flow void sign in the cerebral aqueduct without displaying a marked dilatation (differing from the one in cerebral atrophy) in cortical sulci . Because NPH is the only cause of dementia that benefits from shunt treatment, its differentiation from other dementia causes associated with ventriculomegaly bears importance . NPH may be either idiopathic (INPH) or secondary (SNPH) to subarachnoid hemorrhage, meningitis, cranial trauma, and intracranial surgery . The success rate of shunt treatment in NPH patients varies between 30% and 70%. INPH benefits less from shunt treatment (30%–50%) . Recently, most of the studies have been focused on determination of patients who would benefit from shunt treatment .

Many tests have been employed in the diagnosis of NPH before now. Among the imaging methods, we can mention radionuclide cisternography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MRI), computed tomography cisternography, phase-contrast cine MRI (PC-MRI) . There is no test that can establish a definitive diagnosis or predict shunt response . PC-MRI is noted as a method that is helpful in NPH diagnosis and prediction of shunt therapy . In the present study, we aimed to determine the efficiency of PC-MRI in INPH diagnosis and prediction of treatment response.

A craniocaudal direction consistent with the flow in aqueduct at the systolic phase (arrow) (a) is observed on the phase image. Circular region of interest (ROI) (arrow) was drawn for the aqueduct in a way to cover only aqueduct and reference ROI was placed in the parenchyma of the pons (a) . In the flow graphic, the following parameters can be seen: mean velocity: −1.49 cm/s, aqueductal area: 0.01 cm 2 , and duration for single cardiac cycle: 722 ms (b) . Systole duration (thick arrow) was calculated to be 447 (3.3 × 122/0.9 = 447) ms. CSF stroke volume is found to be −1.49 cm/s × 0.01 cm 2 × 447 ms = −7 μL, whereas CSF output/min was −1.49 cm/s × 0.01 cm 2 ×60 s = −894 μL.
