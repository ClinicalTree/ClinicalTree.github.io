## Rationale and Objectives

Assess the impact of implementing a structured report template and a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool on the quality of prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) reports.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional Review Board approval was obtained for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant study performed at an academic medical center. The study cohort included all prostate mp-MRI reports ( _n_ = 385) finalized 6 months before and after implementation of a structured report template and a CAD tool (collectively the information technology \[IT\] tools) integrated into the picture archiving and communication system workstation. Primary outcome measure was quality of prostate mp-MRI reports. An expert panel of our institution's subspecialty-trained abdominal radiologists defined prostate mp-MRI report quality as optimal, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory based on documentation of nine variables. Reports were reviewed to extract the predefined quality variables and determine whether the IT tools were used to create each report. Chi-square and Student's _t_ tests were used to compare report quality before and after implementation of IT tools.

## Results

The overall proportion of optimal or satisfactory reports increased from 29.8% (47/158) to 53.3% (121/227) ( _P_ < .001) after implementing the IT tools. Although the proportion of optimal or satisfactory reports increased among reports generated using at least one of the IT tools (47/158 = \[29.8%\] vs. 105/161 = \[65.2%\]; _P_ < .001), there was no change in quality among reports generated without use of the IT tools (47/158 = \[29.8%\] vs. 16/66 = \[24.2%\]; _P_ = .404).

## Conclusions

The use of a structured template and CAD tool improved the quality of prostate mp-MRI reports compared to free-text report format and subjective measurement of contrast enhancement kinetic curve.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) is a well-established, noninvasive modality for prostate cancer diagnosis , staging , biopsy targeting , and treatment planning . However, variation in what results are reported and how they are presented remains a barrier to widespread adoption of mp-MRI in clinical practice .

Measuring the quality of radiology reports is a complex task , particularly because of the lack of report standardization and objective key performance indicators . Free-text reports are typically not standardized, thus varying in content and format. Structured report templates have been developed to provide a consistent format and promote use of standard terminology . Compared to conventional, free-text reports, in addition to improving communication of test results, structured reports allow information to be retrieved and reused more easily . However, evidence of the impact of structured templates on the quality of radiology reports compared to free-text format is inconsistent .
