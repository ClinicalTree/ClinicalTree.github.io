Computer disease simulation models are increasingly being used to evaluate and inform health care decisions across medical disciplines. The aim of researchers who develop these models is to integrate and synthesize short-term outcomes and results from multiple sources to predict the long-term clinical outcomes and costs of different health care strategies. Policy makers, in turn, can use the predictions generated by disease models together with other evidence to make decisions related to health care practices and resource utilization. Models are particularly useful when the existing evidence does not yield obvious answers or does not provide answers to the questions of greatest interest, such as questions about the relative cost-effectiveness of different practices. This review focuses on models used to inform decisions about imaging technology, discussing the role of disease models for health policy development and providing a foundation for understanding the basic principles of disease modeling. This manuscript draws from the collective computed tomographic colonography modeling experience, reviewing 10 published investigations of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic colonography relative to colonoscopy. The discussion focuses on implications of different modeling assumptions and difficulties that may be encountered when evaluating the quality of models. This underscores the importance of forging stronger collaborations between researchers who develop disease models and radiologists, to ensure that policy-level models accurately represent the experience of everyday clinical practices.

Computer disease simulation models are increasingly being used to integrate and synthesize short-term evidence about diagnostic tests and procedures to project the long-term clinical and cost outcomes that are typically of interest to policy makers. A recent example of the use of modeling to inform policy decisions is the high-profile evaluation of mammographic screening intervals for the 2009 US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendations . Models incorporate evidence on a variety of elements that affect the effectiveness of a particular technology or procedure, including disease incidence and mortality, operating characteristics of screening and diagnostic tests, patient acceptance of the tests, and treatment effectiveness.

For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently considered predictions from colorectal cancer models together with an independent review of the evidence on colorectal cancer screening that was commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality when deciding if computed tomographic (CT) colonography (CTC) should be a reimbursable method of colorectal cancer screening among Medicare enrollees. The modeling study, conducted by an international team of public health researchers, cancer experts, and biostatisticians, used three independently developed models to predict health outcomes and lifetime cancer-related costs associated with a program of CTC screening compared to colonoscopy screening, sigmoidoscopy screening, fecal occult blood testing, and no colorectal cancer screening . Each of the three models demonstrated that the predicted life-years gained (vs no colorectal cancer screening) from CTC screening among Medicare enrollees were only slightly less than the life-years gained from colonoscopy screening. They found that CTC screening could be a cost-effective option for colorectal cancer screening of the Medicare population if the cost of a CTC was substantially lower than a colonoscopy or if the availability of CTC screening would attract people who would otherwise not undergo colorectal cancer screening. This analysis of CTC motivates our discussion about the uses of disease models, the types of disease models, and how they are developed and applied in comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness research.

## Role of disease simulation models in health policy for radiologic imaging

Researchers seeking information about the impact of imaging technologies on clinical outcomes encounter a variety of types of clinical evidence. However, each has its limitations. These limitations can often be overcome by integrating data with a computer disease simulation model. These models are particularly useful when some short-term outcomes are available about a technology but evidence of the impact on long-term health outcomes is lacking.

Most studies of imaging tests focus on test accuracy, that is, how well a test can identify disease. Although accuracy studies are key to understanding one-time test performance, they provide no information about clinical outcomes . Randomized trials are the gold-standard study design for assessing outcomes. However, they are usually not a feasible method for addressing health policy questions because of their costs and long time horizon for completion and because of the rapidly evolving nature of health care technologies. This is especially true for imaging technologies. In addition, randomized trials may be ethically difficult, or even impossible, to carry out once an imaging test is widely accepted as the standard of care, as is the case with mammography, or when the benefits are widely perceive to outweigh the risks, as in the case of coronary CT angiography . Finally, long-term randomized trials are often not possible because of funding limitations. As a result, randomized trials generally provide information about shorter term outcomes such as the severity of disease detected (eg, early or late stage cancer) or 1-year to 5-year survival outcomes. Trials that focus on long-term disease outcomes following imaging are rare. One example is the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, which randomized 38,349 men and 39,115 women to receive either routine medical care or active screening. In addition to colorectal and prostate cancer screening, the active screening arm included lung cancer screening with a baseline chest x-ray followed by annual chest x-rays for 3 years and, among women, ovarian cancer screening with transvaginal ultrasound and cancer antigen 125 testing . Despite the high value of randomized trials such as the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, the results are not available for guiding policy now: the trial began in 1993 and complete mortality results are anticipated in 2015.

Observational studies are a common first approach for estimating the effect of imaging tests on disease outcomes because they use existing data and can be carried out at relatively low cost. Observational studies often include a broader patient population than randomized trials, providing important additional information, even when results from randomized trials are available . Observational studies can also provide information about longer term outcomes following imaging and information about practices that are “off protocol.” However, observational studies are prone to multiple biases . Although analyses can adjust for these biases, they can account only for known potential biases that were measured in the study. Accordingly, the results from observational studies alone may not provide sufficient evidence to inform health policy decision makers of the effectiveness of a technology.
