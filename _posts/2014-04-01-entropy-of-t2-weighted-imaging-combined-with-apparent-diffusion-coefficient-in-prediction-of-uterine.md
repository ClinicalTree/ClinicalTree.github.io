## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the potential value of entropy of T2-weighted imaging combined with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) before uterine artery embolization (UAE) for prediction of uterine leiomyoma volume reduction (VR) after UAE.

## Materials and Methods

In this prospective study, 11 patients with uterine leiomyomas who underwent pelvic magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted imaging before and 6 months after UAE were included. A total number of 16 leiomyomas larger than 2 cm in diameter were evaluated. The volume of each leiomyoma before and after UAE was determined, and the percentage change in volume was calculated. Entropy of T2-weighted imaging and ADC before UAE were assessed. Pearson correction coefficients were calculated between leiomyoma VR after UAE and age, leiomyoma volume, ADC, and entropy, respectively. Multiple regression analysis was performed to investigate the parameters that determine the VR after UAE. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ADC, entropy and the combination of ADC and entropy for predicting volume response.

## Results

The mean leiomyoma VR was 58.9% (range 25.8%–95.0%) in the 6-month follow-up. The mean ADC of leiomyomas was 1.37 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s (range 1.05 × 10  −3 –2.32 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s) and the mean entropy of T2-weighted imaging was 5.36 (range 4.62–5.91) before UAE. ADC and entropy were significantly correlated with leiomyoma VR, respectively ( _r_ = 0.61, _P_ = .012; _r_ = 0.73, _P_ = .001). On multiple regression analysis, a combination of ADC and entropy constituted the best model for determining leiomyoma VR using Akaike information criterion. For predicting ≥50% VR, the optimal cutoff value of ADC was 1.39 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s (sensitivity 45.5%, specificity 80.0%) and the optimal cutoff value of entropy was 5.15 (sensitivity 90.9%, specificity 60.0%). The combination of ADC and entropy (area under the curve \[AUC\] 0.86) provided better classification accuracy than ADC or entropy alone (AUC 0.69 and 0.82, respectively).

## Conclusions

Pre-UAE entropy of T2-weighted imaging and ADC of leiomyomas were significantly correlated with the leiomyoma VR 6 months after embolization. Higher entropy and higher ADC may be related to greater leiomyoma VR after UAE. A combination of entropy and ADC may have predictive value for leiomyoma VR after UAE.

Leiomyomas are the most common gynecologic neoplasm, with an incidence of 20%–30% in women of reproductive age, which can cause menorrhagia, urinary frequency, constipation, or can negatively impact fertility . In recent years, uterine artery embolization (UAE) has become an alternative option for symptomatic leiomyomas offering minimal invasiveness compared to hysterectomy and myomectomy . UAE has also proven to be effective in improvement of bulk-related symptoms in 90%–96% of cases and a volume reduction of 40%–70% in the dominant leiomyomas . As for the relationship between clinical success and the degree of leiomyoma volume reduction (VR) after embolization, Toor et al. showed that VR after UAE was lesser in patients with poor clinical improvement.

Although ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging technique to diagnose leiomyomas, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more accurate in detection and localization of leiomyomas and discrimination from their mimics, such as adenomyosis or solid adnexal masses . Therefore, MRI is often performed before embolization to assess leiomyomas, their vascular supply, and their potential procedural risk . MRI assessment mainly includes a series of imaging sequences, such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and postcontrast enhancement. MRI appearances give information about the signal intensity (SI), homogeneity, and composition of leiomyomas, which is helpful to recognize nondegenerated and degenerated leiomyomas.
