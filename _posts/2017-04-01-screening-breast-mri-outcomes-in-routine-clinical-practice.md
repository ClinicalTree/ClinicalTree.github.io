## Rationale and Objectives

_The BI-RADS Atlas 5th Edition_ includes screening breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcome benchmarks. However, the metrics are from expert practices and clinical trials of women with hereditary breast cancer predispositions, and it is unknown if they are appropriate for routine practice. We evaluated screening breast MRI audit outcomes in routine practice across a spectrum of elevated risk patients.

## Materials and Methods

This Institutional Review Board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant retrospective study included all consecutive screening breast MRI examinations from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2013. Examination indications were categorized as gene mutation carrier (GMC), personal history (PH) breast cancer, family history (FH) breast cancer, chest radiation, and atypia/lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Outcomes were determined by pathology and/or ≥12 months clinical and/or imaging follow-up. We calculated abnormal interpretation rate (AIR), cancer detection rate (CDR), positive predictive value of recommendation for tissue diagnosis (PPV2) and biopsy performed (PPV3), and median size and percentage of node-negative invasive cancers.

## Results

Eight hundred and sixty examinations were performed in 566 patients with a mean age of 47 years. Indications were 367 of 860 (42.7%) FH, 365 of 860 (42.4%) PH, 106 of 860 (12.3%) GMC, 14 of 860 (1.6%) chest radiation, and 8 of 22 (0.9%) atypia/LCIS. The AIR was 134 of 860 (15.6%). Nineteen cancers were identified (13 invasive, 4 DCIS, two lymph nodes), resulting in CDR of 19 of 860 (22.1 per 1000), PPV2 of 19 of 88 (21.6%), and PPV3 of 19 of 80 (23.8%). Of 13 invasive breast cancers, median size was 10 mm, and 8 of 13 were node negative (61.5%).

## Conclusions

Performance outcomes of screening breast MRI in routine clinical practice across a spectrum of elevated risk patients met the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System benchmarks, supporting broad application of these metrics. The indication of a personal history of treated breast cancer accounted for a large proportion (42%) of our screening examinations, with breast MRI performance in this population at least comparable to that of other screening indications.

## Introduction

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently the most sensitive imaging test for identifying breast cancer, and detects malignancy that is occult to the clinical examination and other imaging modalities . Several prospective studies have demonstrated an increase in the detection of breast cancer with breast MRI over mammography alone in patients with a familial or genetic predisposition for breast cancer . This has led to a rapid increase in the use of breast MRI across the country , particularly in those patients at high risk for the development of breast cancer .

In 2007, the American Cancer Society (ACS) published the first guidelines for breast MRI as an adjunct to mammography to screen patients for breast cancer . These guidelines recommend screening breast MRI in patients with a known genetic predisposition to breast cancer (BRCA mutation or Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndromes and their first-degree relatives), a lifetime risk for breast cancer ~20%–25% or greater, and radiation to the chest between the ages of 10 and 30 years old . Similar guidelines were subsequently enacted by the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) .
