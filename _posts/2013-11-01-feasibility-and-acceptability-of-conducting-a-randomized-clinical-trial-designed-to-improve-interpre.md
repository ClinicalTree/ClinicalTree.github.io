## Purpose

To describe recruitment, enrollment, and participation in a study of US radiologists invited to participate in a randomized controlled trial of two continuing medical education (CME) interventions designed to improve interpretation of screening mammography.

## Methods

We collected recruitment, consent, and intervention-completion information as part of a large study involving radiologists in California, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Vermont. Consenting radiologists were randomized to receive either a 1-day live, expert-led educational session; to receive a self-paced DVD with similar content; or to a control group (delayed intervention). The impact of the interventions was assessed using a preintervention–postintervention test set design. All activities were institutional review board approved and HIPAA compliant.

## Results

Of 403 eligible radiologists, 151 of 403 (37.5%) consented to participate in the trial and 119 of 151 (78.8%) completed the preintervention test set, leaving 119 available for randomization to one of the two intervention groups or to controls. Female radiologists were more likely than male radiologists to consent to and complete the study ( _P_ = .03). Consenting radiologists who completed all study activities were more likely to have been interpreting mammography for 10 years or less compared to radiologists who consented and did not complete all study activities or did not consent at all. The live intervention group was more likely to report their intent to change their clinical practice as a result of the intervention compared to those who received the DVD (50% versus 17.6%, _P_ = .02). The majority of participants in both interventions groups felt the interventions were a useful way to receive CME mammography credits.

## Conclusions

Community radiologists found interactive interventions designed to improve interpretative mammography performance acceptable and useful for clinical practice. This suggests CME credits for radiologists should, in part, be for examining practice skills.

Continuing medical education (CME) has traditionally been a requirement for maintaining qualifications for practicing physicians . Physicians who interpret mammography are required by the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) to obtain at least 15 hours of Category 1 CME units in mammography every 36 months to maintain their qualifications . Justification for continuing CME activities under MQSA is based on a belief that gains in knowledge will lead to improved patient care and outcomes . However, despite the significant level of participation and resources applied to CME, there are two persistent concerns. First, conventional, lecture-based CME may have little, if any, effect on physician performance . Second, 20 years after Congress passed the MQSA, there remains a sizable gap between actual and ideal interpretative performance .

In 1992, the definition of traditional CME had expanded beyond classic passive lectures or grand rounds, as physicians and CME providers were undertaking more complex learning activities such as computer-based simulations using actual patient problems, reading materials, and visits to practice sites by health care professionals trained to improve performance using academic detailing . Several such approaches have been described as positive interventions because they prepared physicians for further learning and improvements in clinical practice . In addition, subsequent studies of more discrete interventions consistently identified three important features of effective CME: (i) assessment of learning needs is a necessary precursor to effective CME, (ii) the importance of interaction among physician-learners with opportunities to practice the skills learned, and (iii) the importance of multifaceted educational activities .
