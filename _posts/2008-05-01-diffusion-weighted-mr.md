## Rationale and Objectives

The study goal was to evaluate the ability of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in assessing the viability of rabbit liver VX-2 tumor after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE).

## Materials and Methods

VX-2 tumors were grown in the livers of 19 rabbits, and chemoembolization was performed. MR imaging was acquired 1 week after TACE. The rabbits were killed for histologic investigation immediately after MR imaging, and the proportion of viable tumor was calculated based on histopathologic examination. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in viable and necrotic tumor portion, and were compared using the paired Student's _t_ test.

## Results

Viable tumors were absent (n = 3), less than 5% (n = 6), and 5% or more (n = 10) at pathology examination. On DWI, three tumors with no viable portion were interpreted as having no viable portion, but three of six tumors with a viable portion of less than 5% were considered as having no viable portion. The mean ADC values of necrotic and viable tumor were 1.653 ± 0.126 mm  2 /sec and 0.883 ± 0.407 mm  2 /sec ( _b_ = 1000 sec/mm  2 ), respectively, and the ADC values of necrotic tumors were significantly greater than those in viable tumors ( _p_ < .01).

## Conclusion

Although DWI is a useful tool for assessing tumor viability, viable tumor may not be detected on DWI when it is too small.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignant tumors ( ). Because of an advanced disease stage and associated liver cirrhosis at its initial presentation, the treatment options are limited and transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been widely performed as a palliative treatment for HCC ( ).

Computed tomography (CT) and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do not provide exact information about the extent of tumor cell death and the amount of viable tumor tissue after treatment ( ). Hyperattenuating Lipiodol impairs the assessment of residual tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT ( ). On gadolinium-enhanced MRI, enhancing areas in the lesion are presumed to represent viable tumor, but they could also be due to post-treatment granulation tissue ( ). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was initially used to evaluate early ischemic brain lesions and its value in this field has been accepted. However, a few studies are available about DWI in evaluating hepatic lesions ( ).
