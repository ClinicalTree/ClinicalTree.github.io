Conventional pulmonary function tests appear normal in early cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease. Therefore, new diagnostic approaches are required that can detect CF lung disease in children and monitor treatment response. Hyperpolarized (HP) gas (  129 Xe and  3 He) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, emergent tool for mapping regional lung function and may be well suited for studying pediatric CF. HP gas MRI is well tolerated, reproducible, and it can be performed longitudinally without the need for ionizing radiation. In particular, quantification of the distribution of ventilation, or ventilation defect percent (VDP), has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of CF lung disease and correlates well with pulmonary function tests.

This article presents the current state of CF diagnosis and treatment and describes the potential role of HP gas MRI for detection of early CF lung disease and following the effects of interventions. The typical HP gas imaging workflow is described, along with a discussion of image analysis to calculate VDP, dosing considerations, and the reproducibility of VDP.

The potential use of VDP as an outcome measure in CF is discussed, by considering the correlation with pulmonary function measures, preliminary interventional studies, and case studies involving longitudinal imaging and pulmonary exacerbations.

Finally, emerging HP gas imaging techniques such as multiple breath washout imaging are introduced, followed by a discussion of future directions. Overall, HP gas MRI biomarkers are expected to provide sensitive outcome measures that can be used in disease surveillance as well as interventional studies involving novel CF therapies.

## INTRODUCTION

## Brief Review of CF

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic, autosomal recessive genetic condition that results from loss of function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene ( ). Lung disease resulting from impaired mucociliary clearance, leading to recurrent pulmonary infections and inflammation, remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Episodic worsening of respiratory symptoms, known as pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), is treated with antibiotics and is a typical manifestation of this disease. Although there is no known cure, the life span and quality of life for patients with CF have increased dramatically in the past 40 years due to improved treatments, among other factors ( ). Conventional CF therapeutic approaches include (i) targeting the cycle of infection and inflammation with inhaled antibiotics ( ) and anti-inflammatory medications ( ), (ii) improving mucociliary clearance by the rehydration of airway secretions with hypertonic saline ( ), and (iii) thinning the tenacious airway mucus with recombinant dornase alfa ( ). More recently, small molecule medications have been developed that increase the capacity of dysfunctional CFTR protein to conduct chloride and bicarbonate across the cellular membrane ( ). As new treatments become available for this disease, sensitive tests to evaluate the efficacy of different treatments, especially in children with milder pulmonary disease, will be crucial to guide treatment decisions.

## Current Diagnostic Approaches and Limitations

Lung disease begins early in the life of pediatric CF patients and, if left untreated, leads to structural lung damage (e.g., bronchiectasis) that is often focal and irreversible ( ). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs), such as spirometry are performed once children are old enough to be able to properly complete the test. Spirometry measures air flow at the mouth, and the most commonly reported parameter is the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV  1 ). FEV  1 is reproducible, relatively effort independent and a low FEV  1 is an excellent marker of pulmonary disability; however, the average rate of annual FEV  1 decline in children with CF is small (i.e., 1%–2.5% per year) ( ) and most children with CF have normal FEV  1 ( ). Therefore, tests that are more sensitive than spirometry are required to accurately reflect the degree of lung pathology and to monitor response to therapy in CF, especially in the early lung disease seen in pediatric patients.

where _V_ fresh is the volume of fresh HP gas introduced by a washin breath and _V_ residual is the volume of HP gas remaining in the lungs from previous breaths. Since initial preclinical studies, the speed and efficiency of washin imaging have improved to a point where clinical translation is now possible ( ). For example, images can be acquired with a variable flip angle trajectory ( ), and a computer-controlled gas delivery system can be used to dispense metered doses of HP gas mixed with O  2 ( ).
