## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the imaging findings of triple-negative breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to investigate whether the findings are different between responders and nonresponders, enabling us to predict the final patient response.

## Materials and Methods

The subjects included 22 women ages 35–73 years (mean, 50.4 years) with 23 triple-negative breast cancers who underwent NAC. In all cases, a mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed a total of three times: before NAC, after the first half of NAC, and after NAC. The mass shape, mass margin, presence of clear intratumoral necrosis, and presence of intratumoral calcification were analyzed. The presence of clear intratumoral necrosis was evaluated on the MRI. If there was a very high signal intensity (similar to that of water) in the tumor on the fat-suppressed T2-weighted MRI scans, we judged it to be clear intratumoral necrosis.

## Results

An irregularly shaped mass ( _P_ = .018) and the presence of clear intratumoral necrosis ( _P_ = .044) were significantly associated with NAC nonresponse in triple-negative breast cancer patients. The mass margin and the presence of intratumoral calcification were not related to the effects after NAC.

## Conclusions

In cases of triple-negative breast cancer involving clear intratumoral necrosis with an irregular mass shape, it is predicted that the effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy will likely be poor, and therefore, the presence of such image findings may be useful for determining the optimal application of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Breast cancer is comparatively sensitive to chemotherapy. In addition, hormone therapy is also effective for hormone receptor–positive breast cancers. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach, which is directed both to the locoregional control (surgery and radiation therapy) and to the destruction of distant micrometastases (chemotherapy and hormone therapy) has become the main strategy in the treatment of breast cancer. The indication for chemotherapy and hormone therapy is generally decided according to the risk category in the International Consensus Conference on Primary Treatment of Breast Cancer . Triple-negative breast cancers, which are negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), are usually resistant tochemotherapy and endocrine therapy, and patients with these tumors have a poor prognosis . However, we are able to clinically identify a triple-negative breast cancer that shows a good response to chemotherapy.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has been the standard treatment for locally advanced breast cancer. NAC is mainly designed to reduce tumor size, thereby permitting breast-conserving surgery . Other advantages for NAC are that systemic therapy may be initiated earlier and enables the evaluation of a patient’s response to chemotherapy . Conversely, a NAC-related disadvantage is the delay in surgical treatment in patients who do not respond to chemotherapy. If we can predict the final chemotherapeutic response during earlier courses of NAC, an earlier and optimized treatment regimen is possible, thereby improving the patient prognosis .
