## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of communication practices with timely follow-up of screening mammograms read as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 0 in the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium.

## Materials and Methods

A radiology facility survey was conducted in 2015 with responses linked to screening mammograms obtained in 2011–2014. We considered timely follow-up to be within 15 days of the screening mammogram. Generalized estimating equation models were used to evaluate the association between modes of communication with patients and providers and timely follow-up, adjusting for PROSPR site, patient age, and race and ethnicity.

## Results

The analysis included 34,680 mammography examinations with a BI-RADS 0 assessment among 28 facilities. Across facilities, 85.6% of examinations had a follow-up within 15 days. Patients in a facility where routine practice was to contact the patient by phone if follow-up imaging was recommended were more likely to have timely follow-up (odds ratio \[OR\] 4.63, 95% confidence interval \[CI\] 2.76–7.76), whereas standard use of mail was associated with reduced timely follow-up (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30–0.75). Facilities that had standard use of electronic medical records to report the need for follow-up imaging to a provider had less timely follow-up (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.35–0.90). Facilities that routinely contacted patients by mail if they missed a follow-up imaging visit were more likely to have timely follow-up (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.02–2.69).

## Conclusions

Our findings support the value of telephone communication to patients in relation to timely follow-up. Future research is needed to evaluate the role of communication in completing the breast cancer screening episode.

## Introduction

Mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality among women aged 40–74 years . Progression through the screening process, from initial screening, through follow-up of abnormal results, to treatment, can fail at multiple points in the screening episode . Lack of effective communication between facilities, providers, and patients may delay follow-up and lead to adverse health outcomes, including anxiety, delay in diagnosis, and widening of cancer outcome disparities .

Mode of communication can impact timely follow-up of abnormal mammograms. Commonly used modes of communicating mammography results to patients include verbal communication (including in-person communication, by telephone, and leaving a voice message) and written communication by conventional mail or through a patient portal to the electronic medical record (EMR). In a study among women of diverse ethnicity who had a screening mammogram and a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 0 result, discussion of results with a provider was associated with more timely follow-up, although this finding did not persist on multivariate analysis controlling for insurance status . Communication factors such as patients asking questions, receiving next-step information, and being told that follow-up is needed have also been associated with timely follow-up of an abnormal mammogram .
