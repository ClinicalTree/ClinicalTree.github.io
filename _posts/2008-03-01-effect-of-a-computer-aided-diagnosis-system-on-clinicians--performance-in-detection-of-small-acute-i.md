## Rationale and Objectives

To analyze the effect of a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system on clinicians’ performance in detection of small acute intracranial hemorrhage (AIH) on computed tomography (CT).

## Materials and Methods

The authors have developed a CAD scheme that used both image processing techniques and anatomic knowledge based classification system to improve diagnosis of small AIH on CT. A multiple-reader, multiple-case receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study was performed. Twenty clinicians, including seven emergency physicians, seven radiology residents, and six radiology specialists were recruited as readers of 60 sets of brain CT, including 30 cases that show AIH smaller than 1 cm, and 30 controls. Each reader read the same 60 cases twice, first without, then with the prompts produced by the CAD system. The clinicians ranked their confidence in diagnosing a case of showing AIH, which produced the ROC curves.

## Results

Significantly improved performance is observed in emergency physicians, average area under the ROC curve (Az) increased from 0.8422 to 0.9294 ( _P_ = .0107) when they make the diagnosis without and with the support of CAD. Az for radiology residents increased from 0.9371 to 0.9762 ( _P_ = .0088). Az for radiology specialists increased from 0.9742 to 0.9868, but was statistically insignificant ( _P_ = .1755).

## Conclusions

CAD can improve the clinicians’ performance in detecting AIH on CT. In particular, emergency physicians can benefit most from the CAD and improve their performance to a level approaching that of the average radiology residents.

Acute intracranial hemorrhage (AIH) is recent (<72 hours) bleeding inside skull. It can be the result of stroke or complication of head injury. The presence or absence of AIH requires different treatment strategies and its identification is of prime importance for triage of patients suffering from acute neurologic disturbance or head injury. However, it is well recognized that clinical findings cannot accurately differentiate between patients with AIH and those who suffer from other neurologic emergencies. Therefore neuroimaging findings are essential for immediate management decision making ( ). Computed tomography (CT) has been the modality of choice for evaluating suspected AIH because it is widely available, quick to perform, and compatible with most life support devices. On CT images, acute blood clot shows higher attenuation than normal brain parenchyma ( ). The contrast between AIH and the adjacent structures depends on intrinsic physical properties of blood clot including the density, volume, location; relationship to surrounding structures; and technical factors including scanning angle, slice thickness, and windowing ( ). Although diagnosis of AIH on CT is usually straightforward, identification of the demonstrable AIH on CT can become difficult when the lesion is inconspicuous (eg, small or being masked by normal structures, or when the reader is inexperienced).

In most parts of the world outside the United States, acute care physicians, including emergency physicians, internists, or neural surgeons, are the only ones to read the CT images at odd hours, when radiologists’ expertise may not be immediately available. This may not be a desirable arrangement because the skill of acute care physicians regarding interpretation of brain CT has been shown to be imperfect ( ). Even radiology residents can, albeit infrequently, overlook hemorrhage on brain CT ( ). Therefore the authors have developed a CAD system that identifies small AIH to help in the management of patients suffering from acute neurologic disturbance or head injury in an emergent setting ( ).

![Figure 1, Flow chart and the intermediary outputs after successive steps of the algorithm. Basic components of a usual computer-assisted diagnosis, including image preprocessing, image segmentation, image analysis, and classification are all used. 1. Intracranial contents segmented using thresholding and morphologic operations followed by preprocessing steps that reduce noise and computed tomography cupping artifacts. 2. Intracranial contents aligned by locating mid-sagittal plane and boundaries of the brain. 3. Acute intracranial hemorrhage (AIH) candidates extracted using combined method of top-hat transform and left-right comparison. 4. AIH candidates rendered anatomic meaning by registration against a purposely developed coordinate system. 5. Genuine AIH distinguished from mimicking variants or artifacts by the rule based classification system, using both image features and anatomical information. The intracerebral hemorrhage in right basal ganglia is correctly identified as genuine AIH and outlined in red, whereas the mimics are outlined in blue.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EffectofaComputeraidedDiagnosisSystemonCliniciansPerformanceinDetectionofSmallAcuteIntracranialHemorrhageonComputedTomography/0_1s20S1076633207005740.jpg)
