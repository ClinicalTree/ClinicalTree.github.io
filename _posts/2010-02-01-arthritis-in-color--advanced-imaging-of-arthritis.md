_Arthritis in Color_ is an in-depth book detailing the most recent advances in arthritis imaging. Each author is a musculoskeletal subspecialist with a research interest in arthritis imaging. Collaboration with six other contributors, each of whom has a particular research interest in arthritis imaging, provides the reader with a unique level of expert authorship.

There are two main parts to the book. The first half of part 1 is about advanced imaging of osteoarthritis and its relevance to clinical practice. This includes advanced magnetic resonance techniques, functional anatomy, image assessment, surgical repair of osteochondral injury, and postoperative imaging. The remainder of part 1 is devoted to ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear imaging methods (including positron emission tomography) and their applications for assessing rheumatoid arthritis. The second part of the book discusses the future of advanced arthritis imaging with new and emerging magnetic resonance imaging and molecular imaging techniques to assess both rheumatoid and osteoarthritis.

The book is very well written. The authors have taken technical subject matter and discussed it in readable prose. Their discussions are thoughtful and thorough but not exhausting to read. The schematic illustrations and radiographic images are superb throughout the text. Incorporating clinical advances in the management of arthritis, both medical and surgical, gives the reader a better understanding of new paradigms in disease management. Furthermore, this approach helps better define what imaging can contribute to disease diagnosis, therapy response, and further investigation of new and emerging treatments. With their collective expertise, the authors have summarized the most relevant knowledge from the literature and presented it in a clear and concise text. The reader is left with a new appreciation for arthritis.

This book would be most useful to radiology residents, musculoskeletal fellows, and practicing radiologists.
