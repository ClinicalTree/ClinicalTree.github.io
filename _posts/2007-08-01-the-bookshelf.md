I love beautiful books, and this one, _Diagnostic and Surgical Imaging Anatomy: Chest, Abdomen Pelvis_ , certainly fits that bill. This richly illustrated volume covers each of the above anatomic regions in a complete and extremely logical manner, leading the reader through embryology, detailed anatomy, a description of salient physiology, and just the right amount of pathology to remind us why a knowledge of anatomy is so vital for its detection.

As would be expected for an anatomy text, the book is mainly image-based, and what exquisite images they are! The more than 2,500 illustrations include high-quality pictures from every modality, concentrating mainly on computed tomography and 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. These are extensively supplemented by medical illustrations of such high quality that I was tempted to set this book out on my coffee table. All of these images are thoroughly annotated. Interspersed through the atlas is text presented in outline form that further elucidates the visual material. Although I’m not usually a fan of bullet-point presentation of text, in this case it is just right.

Although this is, at heart, a reference book, I found that the material is presented in such a way as to draw the reader in, as the “story” of that anatomic region unfolds. The book can be easily and very enjoyable read from start to finish, much to the benefit of the peruser.

As Dr. Morton A. Meyers (who knows a thing or two about the elegant and logical presentation of anatomy) states in the forward, “anatomy is so intimately linked to physiology and pathology that this text is a gem for any student or practitioner involved with the human body in modern medicine.” Enough said.
