Radiology is fortunate in having outstanding professional societies representing their interests.

In 1965 when Medicare was introduced, the disciplines of radiology, anesthesiology and pathology were defined as hospital services as are nursing, food services, and pharmacy. At that time, the American College of Radiology (ACR) effectively lobbied to have radiology redefined as a medical discipline . What would have happened to our specialty if radiology had not moved into Part “B” of Medicare as were all other physician services? In the late 1980s an attempt was made to rein in the costs for hospital services by combining professional services for radiology, anesthesiology and pathology (RAP legislation). The ACR was again successful in preventing this from becoming law. Similar success stories can be told about the other broad- based radiological societies (ie, the American Board of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, the American Roentgen Ray Society, and the Association of University Radiologists).

The 15-year history and accomplishments of the Academy of Radiology Research is another remarkable story. In the early 1970s, the Conjoint Committee on Diagnostic Radiology was formed with the goal of enhancing awareness of radiology research and advancing this need to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as other governmental agencies. With the help of the Conjoint Committee, the profile of imaging research did advance and support from the NIH improved. However, a major problem for our discipline still existed in the way the NIH’s institutes were organized. Originally, the divisions of the NIH were structured as academic medical departments such as the National Microbiological Institute and the Experimental Biology and Medicine Institute. This changed in the 1950s when the NIH realized that institutes named after diseases stood a better chance of being funded by Congress. Because the NIH was made up of individual institutes, organized by a specific organ system or disease, it remained difficult to obtain support for imaging research unless the grant application fit into the mission of that particular institute. In an effort to address this problem, in 1995, the Conjoint Committee of Diagnostic Radiology was restructured into the Academy of Radiology Research. The specific mission of this new group was to establishing a new institute at the NIH dedicated to the basic science of imaging.

Because this new institute would compete for existing resources, the leaders of the NIH were not enthusiastic. The Academy recognized that the creation of this new institute would require a massive congressional lobbying effort and its success would be dependent on the support of all of the radiological societies, as well as the community of practicing radiologists.

For the first 5 years, the Academy organized hundreds of meetings between radiologists and individual members of Congress. Convincing arguments were presented to explain how this new institute would benefit not only radiology and the science of imaging, but more importantly, the health of the public.

The bioengineering community also felt disenfranchised by the organizational structure of the NIH and in 1998 the Academy of Radiology Research joined forces with the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE).
