## Rationale and Objectives

We conducted an observer study to investigate whether radiologists can judge similarities in pairs of breast masses and lung nodules consistently and reproducibly.

## Materials and Methods

Institutional review board approval and informed observer consent were obtained. This study was compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. We used eight pairs of breast masses on mammograms and eight pairs of lung nodules on computed tomographic images, for which subjective similarity ratings ranging from 0 to 1 were determined in our previous studies. From these, four sets of image pairs were created (ie, a set of eight mass pairs, a set of eight nodule pairs, and two mixed sets of four mass and four nodule pairs). Eight radiologists, including four breast radiologists and four chest radiologists, compared all combinations of the eight pairs in each set using a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) method to determine the similarity ranking scores by identifying which pair was more similar than the other pair based on the overall impression for diagnosis.

## Results

In the mass set and nodule set, the relationship between the average subjective similarity ratings and the average similarity ranking scores by 2AFC indicated very high correlations ( _r_ = 0.91 and 0.88). Moreover, in the two mixed sets, the correlations between the average subjective similarity ratings and the average similarity ranking scores were also very high ( _r_ = 0.90 and 0.98). Thus, radiologists were able to compare the similarities for pairs of lesions consistently, even in the unusual comparison of pairs of completely different types of lesions.

## Conclusion

The subjective similarity of a pair of lesions in medical images can be quantified consistently by a group of radiologists. The concept of similarity of lesions in medical images can be subjected to rigorous scientific research and investigation in the future.

In radiologic diagnosis, the term _similar images_ generally implies that one lesion in an image pair closely resembles another lesion in the pair based on radiologists' diagnostic criteria ( ). In many clinical situations, availability of similar images could be very useful for radiologists ( ). For diagnosis of a new unknown lesion, for example, radiologists routinely make use of similar images with known pathology from textbooks, teaching files, and past clinical cases. For less experienced radiologists, it is common to view teaching files with many images with similar lesions for improving their interpretive skills as a part of their training. To retrieve similar images automatically from a database, it is necessary to quantify the radiologists' impression of similarity of lesions when one lesion is compared with another in medical images. In previous studies, investigators have attempted to measure subjective similarities of image pairs for masses ( ) and clustered microcalcifications ( ) on mammograms and for lung nodules on computed tomographic (CT) images ( ) by groups of radiologists in observer performance studies. However, if the subjective similarities of image pairs by radiologists were to differ from modality to modality and/or from lesion to lesion, it would be irreconcilably difficult to quantify the similarities of image pairs of lesions. It is thus crucially important to understand whether the concept of similarity in medical images can be generalized independent of the types of lesions and/or imaging modalities. Therefore, we consider it is necessary to further investigate the consistency and reproducibility of radiologists' subjective judgment regarding similarities of many pairs of lesions to establish a method for searching reliably similar images to assist radiologists' image interpretation.

In this study, to investigate whether radiologists can judge the similarities of image pairs consistently and reproducibly, we conducted an observer study on comparison of image pairs of lesions (ie, mass pairs and nodule pairs) using a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) method for the selection of more similar image pairs based on the overall impression for diagnosis. We decided to employ the 2AFC method, also known as a paired comparison method ( ), because it is highly sensitive in the distinction of a small difference in comparison of two patterns placed side by side. In this study, we obtained subjective similarity ranking scores by radiologists, which can indicate the relative rankings of similarities among the many image pairs examined.
