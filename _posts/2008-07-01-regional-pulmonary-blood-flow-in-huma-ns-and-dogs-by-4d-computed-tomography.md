## Rationale and Objectives

Pulmonary vascular control mechanisms are complex and likely to differ between species. We wish to quantify regional perfusion and the effects of gravity using computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Sequential density measurements following the administration of a bolus of iodinated contrast medium were acquired from four healthy human subjects and four dogs.

## Results

In humans, perfusion (Q) was linear throughout most of the range of vertical height, with an overall gradient of −2.6% cm  −1 . However, when perfusion was normalized to “tissue” density (blood plus tissue: sQ  t ), maximum perfusion occurred around the mid-range of vertical height, being 9% (range 1–22%) greater than either the dorsal or ventral extreme. Within discrete transverse axial sections, concentric zones of perfusion centered on blood vessels were demonstrated. The relationship between sQ  t and vertical height in dogs was distinctly linear, with a gradient of −7.2% cm  −1 . In dogs, the median gradient of Q was −13.6% cm  −1 (range −9.7 to −17.1%).

## Conclusions

Differences in regional pulmonary perfusion, particularly the vertical gradient observed in humans and dogs, may in part reflect anatomic differences between the symmetric dichotomous branching structure of the human pulmonary vasculature and the more asymmetrical structure found in dogs.

The mechanisms that regulate pulmonary vascular control are poorly understood, but assume therapeutic significance in patients with clinical conditions characterized by ventilation perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, such as pulmonary embolism and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regional pulmonary perfusion has been studied using radioactive tracers ( ), positron emission tomography (PET) ( ), single positron emission computed tomography ( ), and magnetic resonance imaging ( ). Computed tomography (CT), despite its superior spatial resolution and shorter acquisition times, has not been as fully explored ( ). Previous studies of pulmonary perfusion in humans using CT have been limited to discrete sampling at defined regions of interest (ROIs), and revealed increased perfusion to dependent lung regions ( ), but were not analyzed on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The aims of this study were twofold. First, using four-dimensional CT, regional pulmonary perfusion was characterized in conscious, normal human subjects, to identify the effect of gravity on perfusion gradients in the normal lung. Second, previously acquired data from dogs using the same methodology ( ) were reanalyzed using the technical modifications necessary in human subjects. This allowed interspecies comparisons to identify differences that might relate to the different vascular branching patterns in the two species. Quadrupeds have been used extensively to study pulmonary perfusion, and inference has been drawn to perfusion in humans, although equivalence of their pulmonary physiology has not been demonstrated.

## Materials and methods

## Study Subjects

Volunteer studies were performed in six male human subjects between the ages of 30 and 48 years) at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London, UK. All subjects were nonsmokers and self-reported to be healthy. Males were chosen to avoid exposure of breast tissue to radiation. The protocol was approved by local institutional board review, and all subjects provided informed written consent. All animal studies were performed within guidelines for animal care stipulated by the American Physiological Society and the National Institutes of Health. Dogs evaluated in this study are reported in Chon et al and preparation details are provided in that study ( ). Studies were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

where ΔHU  t = the difference between baseline and peak density in the tissue ROI (HU) and AUC  a = the area under the time attenuation curve of the feeding vessel (HU). Thus, perfusion is measured as blood flow per unit voxel, and is independent of the volume of the ROI sampled. This method assumes negligible contrast washout from the parenchymal ROI before peak opacification ( ).
