## Rationale and Objectives

Hyperpolarized  3 He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ventilation abnormalities are visible in ex-smokers without airflow limitation, but the clinical relevance of this is not well-understood. Our objective was to phenotype healthy ex-smokers with normal and abnormally elevated ventilation defect percent (VDP).

## Materials and Methods

Sixty ex-smokers without airflow limitation provided written informed consent to  3 He MRI, computed tomography (CT), and pulmonary function tests in a single visit.  3 He MRI VDP and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured for whole-lung and each lung lobe as were CT measurements of emphysema (relative area \[RA\] with attenuation ≤−950 HU, RA  950 ) and airway morphology (wall area percent \[WA%\], lumen area \[LA\] and LA normalized to body surface area \[LA/BSA\]).

## Results

In 42 ex-smokers, there was abnormally elevated VDP and no significant differences for pulmonary function, RA  950 , or airway measurements compared to 18 ex-smokers with normal VDP. Ex-smokers with abnormally elevated VDP reported significantly greater  3 He ADC in the apical lung (right upper lobe \[RUL\], _P_ = .02; right middle lobe \[RML\], _P_ = .04; and left upper lobe \[LUL\], _P_ = .009). Whole lung (r = 0.40, _P_ = .001) and lobar VDP (RUL, r = 0.32, _P_ = .01; RML, r = 0.46, _P_ = .002; right lower lobe \[RLL\], r = 0.38, _P_ = .003; LUL, r = 0.35, _P_ = .006; and left lower lobe, r = 0.37, _P_ = .004) correlated with regional  3 He ADC. Although whole-lung VDP and CT airway morphology measurements were not correlated, regional VDP was correlated with RUL LA (r = −0.37, _P_ = .004), LA/BSA (r = −0.42, _P_ = .0008), RLL WA% (r = 0.28, _P_ = .03), LA (r = −0.28, _P_ = .03), and LA/BSA (r = −0.37, _P_ = .004).

## Conclusions

Abnormally elevated VDP in ex-smokers without airflow limitation was coincident with very mild emphysema detected using MRI and regional airway remodeling detected using CT representing a subclinical obstructive lung disease phenotype.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by irreversible airflow limitation caused by small airway remodeling, airway obliteration , and emphysematous tissue destruction . COPD is typically diagnosed after respiratory symptoms become obvious and intolerable , and this usually occurs when spirometry measurements of lung function reflect airflow limitation and obstruction. However, it is well understood that ex- and current-smokers may report normal lung function and mild symptoms, and this may represent an early or “subclinical” phase. A deep understanding of the underlying morphologic changes that accompany this “subclinical” phase is lacking, mainly because methods for evaluating pulmonary function cannot detect very mild or early structure–function abnormalities.

Hyperpolarized  3 He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ventilation heterogeneity has been shown in patients with pulmonary diseases such as COPD , asthma , and cystic fibrosis . At the same time, however, preclinical or subclinical  3 He ventilation heterogeneity has also been observed in volunteers without clinical signs or symptoms of lung disease such as healthy elderly never-smokers , ex-smokers without airflow limitation , in second-hand smoke exposed adults , and current-smokers without disease . To evaluate the underlying anatomic and structural determinants of ventilation heterogeneity, thoracic x-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used to help determine the spatial relationship of airways disease and emphysema with ventilation abnormalities. For example, recent work provided evidence that in COPD,  3 He ventilation defects represent regions of emphysema and airways disease and that this relationship depends on disease severity. In asthma ,  3 He ventilation heterogeneity was also shown to be spatially related to abnormally remodeled airways. However, the pathophysiological origins and contributions of very mild or subclinical airways disease and emphysema to ventilation heterogeneity in ex-smokers without airflow limitation have not been investigated and remain poorly understood.
