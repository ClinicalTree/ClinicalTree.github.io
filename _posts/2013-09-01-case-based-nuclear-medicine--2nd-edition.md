In this second edition, authors Donohoe and Van den Abbeele present a collection of 166 nuclear medicine cases with brilliant images and thoughtful discussion. The book targets radiology and nuclear medicine residents who are both learning the basics and preparing for their examinations. The main strength of the book lies in the image quality, interpretation, and in-depth case discussions.

Images are large and many are in full color. The authors included several other imaging modalities beyond nuclear medicine that help to demonstrate a realistic workup. A dedicated image interpretation section is included in each case, a feature that should be included with all radiology case review books. Unique to _Case-Based Nuclear Medicine_ is the extensive focus on understanding physiologic imaging and study technique. Each case includes a technique section that describes what tracers were used and how the images were acquired. Although the technique section can be very repetitive (eg, bone scans typically have the same technique and therefore the section is identical for all 20 + cases), this section is very helpful for the radiology resident who often lacks in real-world experience with nuclear medicine study protocols.

The book is organized differently from most case review books, containing 14 sections based primarily on anatomy. The sections include: skeletal, cardiac, pulmonary, endocrine, renal, biliary, lymphatic, central nervous system, gastrointestinal, vascular, and pediatric scintigraphy. Additional sections dedicated to positron emission tomography/computed tomography, neuroendocrine, inflammation/infection, and radioisotope therapy are included. A helpful appendix summarizing the pertinent properties of the common nuclear medicine tracers is included at the end of the book.

Each case is presented as an unknown with a brief clinical history and relevant images. Next, the imaging protocol and technique is described, followed by image interpretation, differential diagnosis, clinical information, and discussion. All cases end with a “pearls and pitfalls section” that serves to highlight the important aspects of the case. For those inclined to dig deeper, each case also provides multiple references.

_Case-Based Nuclear Medicine_ shares many of the great features found in the RadCases series, also published by Thieme. It differs in layout and the discussion section of each case is formatted in typical paragraph layout, with no bullet points. The cases are typically longer and go more in depth compared to the RadCases series. In real-world use, this 550-page book functions more like a comprehensive textbook than a quick review book. To complement the broad nature of the book, Thieme is including 12 months of online access to the excellent RadCases website. The online software is compatible with desktop and mobile platforms and features 250 additional high-yield nuclear medicine cases.

In _Case-Based Nuclear Medicine_ , the authors have stressed an understanding of physiologic imaging essential to the successful practice of nuclear medicine. The combination of the more comprehensive _Case-Based Nuclear Medicine_ text with the online rapid review RadCases material is an outstanding way to both learn and review the topic of nuclear medicine.
