## Rationale and Objective

Breast cancer can be divided into four major molecular subtypes based on the expression of hormone receptor (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER2 status, and molecular proliferation rate (Ki67). In this study, we sought to investigate the association between breast cancer subtype and radiological findings in the Chinese population.

## Materials and Methods

Medical records of 300 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients were reviewed from the database: the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. The imaging characteristics of the lesions were evaluated. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer were classified into four types: luminal A, luminal B, HER2 overexpressed (HER2), and basal-like breast cancer (BLBC). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the subtype (dependent variable) and mammography or 15 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicators (independent variables).

## Results

Luminal A and B subtypes were commonly associated with “clustered calcification distribution,” “nipple invasion,” or “skin invasion” ( _P_ < 0.05). The BLBC subtype was more commonly associated with “rim enhancement” and persistent inflow type enhancement in delayed phase ( _P_ < 0.05). HER2 overexpressed cancers showed association with persistent enhancement in the delayed phase on MRI and “clustered calcification distribution” on mammography ( _P_ < 0.05).

## Conclusion

Certain radiological features are strongly associated with the molecular subtype and hormone receptor status of breast tumor, which are potentially useful tools in the diagnosis and subtyping of breast cancer.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide . It is a heterogeneous disease with several distinct molecular subtypes based on receptor status, including expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–neu (HER2). Immunochemistry staining of the proliferation marker Ki67 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) also aid in the molecular subtyping of breast cancer. There are four major molecular subtypes: luminal A (ER+ or PR+ and HER2−), luminal B (ER+ or PR+ and HER2+), HER2 (ER− and PR− and HER2+), and basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) (ER−, PR−, and HER2−), which has a significant overlap with triple-negative breast cancer . Determination of molecular subtype may aid in treatment planning and monitoring the efficacy of therapy .

The different tumor biology of the molecular subtypes of breast cancer exhibits different morphologic patterns and microscopic pathology appearances . Different pathologic subtypes may cause different imaging features . We sought to investigate the association between imaging characteristics (ultrasound mammography and magnetic resonance imaging \[MRI\]) and the pathologic subtype of tumors.
