## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion techniques and MR spectroscopy (MRS) provide specific physiological information that may allow distinction between recurrent glioma and progression from stable disease.

## Materials and Methods

Forty patients underwent conventional MR imaging, dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion imaging, dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion imaging (DSC), and multivoxel MRS. Arterial spin labeling was available in 26 of these patients. Quantitative parameters were calculated in tumor recurrences and stable disease, which were retrospectively verified on clinical and radiological follow-up. Receiver operating characteristic curves for each parameter were generated for the differentiation between recurrent glioma and stable disease. A forward discriminant analysis was undertaken to assess the power of the conjunction of MR perfusion techniques and MRS.

## Results

Of the 40 patients, 23 were determined to have recurrent gliomas. Differences in arterial spin labeling between the two groups were not statistically significant ( _P_ = .063). Sensitivities and specificities for the detection of recurrent lesions in dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted perfusion imaging and DSC were 61.9% and 80% transfer constant _k(trans)_ , 77.3% and 84.6% for cerebral blood flow, and 81% and 76.9% for cerebral blood volume, respectively. Among the parameters in MRS, the ratio of choline to normalized creatine showed the best diagnostic accuracy ( _P_ = .014; sensitivity 70%, specificity 78.6%). When considering all perfusion modalities, diagnostic accuracy could be increased to 82.5%, adding MRS to the multiparametric approach resulted in a diagnostic accuracy of 90.0%.

## Conclusions

MR perfusion techniques and MRS are useful tools that enable improved differentiation between recurrent glioma and stable disease. Among the single parameters, DSC showed the best diagnostic performance. Multiparametric assessment substantially improved the ability to differentiate the two entities.

The current therapy for high-grade gliomas includes surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, but tumor recurrence or progression is often seen in the course of the disease. Furthermore, up to 30% of these patients develop treatment-related injury that can mimic tumor recurrence or progression in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . On anatomic MRI, corpus callosum involvement and multiple enhancing lesions may suggest recurrent tumor , but this is not robustly reliable. Contrast-enhanced MRI has a low specificity in the differentiation because a breakdown of the blood–brain barrier is seen in both radiation-induced necrosis and tumor recurrence. In many cases, the peritumoral territory will contain both chemoradiation injury and possible recurrent tumor . This mixed pathology makes it impossible to dichotomize patients into either tumor recurrence or pure radionecrosis. Even histological results may contain mixed pathology, and the determination whether tumor cells after radiation are viable is often difficult . Surgical biopsy samples may not be representative of the whole lesion, especially via the minimally invasive approach. Therefore, the term “stable disease” was proposed by some authors. The clinical outcome and management strategy of patients with tumor progression differ profoundly, and functional MRI is increasingly used to monitor the therapeutic effects of combined chemoradiation schemas in treating gliomas. A reliable noninvasive methodology for the differentiation between stable disease and tumor recurrence is highly needed.

In theory, the membrane turnover, the cell density, and the vasculature expression are higher in recurrent tumors than in radiation injuries . This could be measured in metabolic and hemodynamic parameters. Functional MRI enables the assessment of several parameters using different technical approaches. Perfusion techniques including arterial spin labeling (ASL), dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (DCE), and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging (DCS) are most frequently used and enable the assessment of perfusion parameters like cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and the transfer constant between the blood plasma and extracellular space, _k(trans)_ . However, there is no consensus regarding which technique provides the best diagnostic accuracy for the differentiation of recurrent glioma from stable disease. In addition, MR spectroscopy (MRS) enables the quantification and comparison of metabolites including choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and _N_ -acetylaspartate (NAA).
