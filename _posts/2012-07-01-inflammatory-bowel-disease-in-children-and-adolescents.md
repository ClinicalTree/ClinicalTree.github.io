## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) compared to histopathology in the evaluation of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease and to assess interreader reliability for image interpretation.

## Materials and Methods

All magnetic resonance enterography studies performed for known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease between July 2009 and July 2010 were retrospectively reviewed by two pediatric radiologists. Exams were evaluated for signs of enteric inflammation and extraenteric disease. A five-point, Likert-type scale was used to assess the overall likelihood of active inflammation, with scores ≥ 3 considered positive. Cohen's κ coefficient was calculated to assess interreader agreement. A subset of patients who had undergone ileocolonoscopy or surgery with confirmed histopathology within 45 days of MRE were used to assess the accuracy of MRE for detecting active inflammation in the terminal ileum and large bowel.

## Results

A total of 91 magnetic resonance enterography studies were reviewed. Of these, 45 had comparison histopathology within 45 days. The overall sensitivity of MRE for detecting active inflammation compared to ileocolonoscopy was 92% for both readers, while specificity was 100% for reader 1 and 75% for reader 2. Of the individual parameters evaluated, mucosal hyperenhancement and bowel wall thickening were the most sensitive indicators of active inflammation, each having sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 88%. Cohen's κ coefficient was 0.59, indicating moderate agreement between the readers.

## Conclusions

MRE has high overall diagnostic accuracy for detecting active bowel inflammation in pediatric patients compared to ileocolonoscopy and demonstrates moderate interreader reliability.

The preferred modality for evaluating potential small bowel inflammation in patients with known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) varies greatly on the basis of provider or patient preference, hospital or regional standard, and the availability of different modalities. Ileocolonoscopy is a first-line investigation in the diagnostic workup . Visualization of the colonic mucosa as well as the terminal ileum with histologic sampling in combination with clinical findings usually provides a definitive diagnosis. Most guidelines also call for evaluation of the entire small bowel when the diagnosis is uncertain, because Crohn disease (CD) in particular frequently affects areas not reached by standard ileocolonoscopy . Additionally, the absence of abnormal findings on ileocolonoscopy in the colon and terminal ileum does not exclude IBD, because a minority of patients with CD will have isolated disease in the more proximal gastrointestinal tract .

In the past, imaging methods for assessment of small bowel inflammation have included enteroclysis or small bowel follow-through. Although these methods are still widely used and remain the preferred imaging study at many institutions, their low sensitivity and specificity and relatively low interreader reliability have led to an increased use of more advanced techniques with higher diagnostic yield . More recently, computed tomographic enterography, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE), ultrasound, and capsule endoscopy each have been advocated as the ideal method of evaluating the small bowel in patients with known or suspected IBD. Although each of these modalities has advantages and disadvantages, MRE may be the most promising modality because of its ability to provide excellent soft tissue contrast, cine and multiplanar capabilities, evaluation of enhancement patterns, and detection of extraintestinal complications without the use of ionizing radiation.
