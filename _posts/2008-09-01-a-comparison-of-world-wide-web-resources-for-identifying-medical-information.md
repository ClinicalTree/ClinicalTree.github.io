## Rationale and Objectives

To compare the utility of a search engine, Google, with other medical and non-medical, web-based resources for identifying specific medical information.

## Materials and Methods

This institutional review board–approved case cross-over study randomly assigned 89 medical student volunteers to use either Google or any other web-based resource (excluding Google) to research 10 advanced medical questions in a multiple choice exam. Primary outcome measures were resource efficiency (inversely related to number of links used to identify the correct answer for each question) and correctness (number of correct answers/total number of questions answered). For Google searches, the sites providing the information in question were also evaluated.

## Results

The most frequently selected non-Google resources were Yahoo ( _n_ = 531), Ask.com ( _n_ = 110), and the interactive encyclopedia Wikipedia.com ( _n_ = 74). Google was more efficient than all other resources (1.50 vs. 1.94 mean links, _P_ < .0001), with no significant difference in correctness (97% \[756/780\] vs. 96% \[747/780\], _P_ = .16). After a Google search, the four most common categories of sites that provided the correct answer were dictionary/encyclopedia sites, medical websites, National Library of Medicine resources, or journal websites. Yahoo was less efficient than Google (1.90 vs. 1.54 mean links, _P_ < .0001). However, non-Google search engines were more efficient than web sites (eg, Wikipedia, medical websites) and PubMed (1.87 vs. 2.54 mean links, _P_ = .0004).

## Conclusion

Google is an efficient web resource for identifying specific medical information, by guiding users to an array of medical resources.

Data reported in 2006 revealed that 99% of practicing US physicians who participated in a survey use the Internet, and 95% use search engines to identify medical information ( ). With respect to preferred web resources, most physicians (92%) in a recent Missouri survey reported that they favor a specific website (including research databases) over commercial search engines to “gather medical information” ( ). Nearly one-third (32%) preferred sites that present “edited data,” including UpToDate (  www.uptodate.com ), Medscape (  www.medscape.com ), WebMD (  www.webmd.com ), MD Consult (  www.mdconsult.com ), and eMedicine (  www.emedicine.com ), whereas 27% indicated that they favor research databases, such as PubMed (  www.pubmed.org ) ( ). Limitations of generalized search engines include physicians' concerns about the accuracy of the information identified ( ) and evidence that medical search engines identify websites of higher quality than generalized search engines ( ).

Despite these limitations, generalized search engines are used increasingly to direct web users to the medical literature. Google was the most frequent source of search engine referrals (including PubMed) to articles in the journals hosted by HighWire in 2006 ( ) and to the _British Medical Journal_ website in 2005 ( ). However, commercial search engines access a broad assortment of non-medical and medical web resources beyond journals. Although the disadvantage of a search engine is a concern over the quality of the content presented, medical websites have limitations as well when searching for medical information; the resource selected may not contain information on the topic of interest. With PubMed, navigating through a chronologic list of results can be time-consuming, access to the full text of an article may require a fee, and the article may not ultimately provide the specific information needed.
