## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate whether baseline apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps can be employed to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes in acute ischemic stroke.

## Materials and Methods

An automated image analysis system based on baseline ADC maps was tested against 30 patients with acute ischemic stroke of anterior circulation to predict both infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes. The predicted infarct core and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue were quantitatively and qualitatively compared with follow-up imaging data in recanalization and no recanalization groups, respectively. Direct comparisons with perfusion- and diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging measures were also made. Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Spearman rank correlation, and Bland-Altman plots were performed.

## Results

In the recanalization group, the predicted infarct core volume was significantly correlated with the final infarct volume ( _r_ = 0\. 868, _P_ < .001). In the no recanalization group, the predicted final infarct volume (sum of the predicted infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue volumes), as well as the predicted salvageable ischemic tissue volume, was also significantly correlated with the true final infarct volume ( _r_ = 0.955, _P_ < .001) and infarct growth ( _r_ = 0.918, _P_ < .001), respectively. The volumes of perfusion-diffusion mismatch were significantly larger than those of infarct growth and predicted salvageable ischemic tissue. Good agreement between predicted and true final infarct lesions was visualized by Bland-Altman plots in two groups. Direct visual comparative analysis revealed good qualitative agreement between the true final infarct and predicted lesions in 21 patients.

## Conclusion

The proposed ADC based approach may be a feasible and practical tool to predict the volumes of infarct core and salvageable ischemic tissue without intravenous contrast media–enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging at baseline.

The ischemic penumbra is defined as tissue at risk of infarction but with the potential to recover . Current clinical imaging protocol for acute ischemic stroke attempts to identify irreversible injured brain tissue and the ischemic penumbra. Accurate and rapid estimation of the size of these regions during the early therapeutic window will influence the very choice of the most effective therapy and be necessary to estimate the likely benefit after treatment . Currently, multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are recommended by the guidelines as the most clinically useful tools to characterize the ischemic deficit in a clinical setting . The mismatch between a larger lesion on DSC-PWI and a smaller lesion on DWI has been widely used to mirror the ischemic penumbra, and the concept of the penumbra has been represented by that of PWI-DWI mismatch .

However, the PWI-DWI mismatch model suffers from several serious drawbacks and has been greatly challenged . First, DWI abnormal areas, which are widely used as routine protocols to delineate irreversibly infarct tissues in the PWI-DWI mismatch model, may still be viable and reversible . In addition, DWI signal intensity depends on variable factors such as confounding T2 effects and diffusion rate of water molecules. Second, it has not been determined yet which DSC-PWI parameter most closely identifies tissue at risk . The PWI abnormal areas cannot reliably distinguish the penumbral tissue from oligemia. Consequently, the putative ischemic penumbra is in rather crude estimates and may be overestimated, which may result in overtreatment of thrombolysis . Furthermore, DSC-PWI requires intravenous contrast agent injection, is invasive and tedious in limited time scheme of acute ischemic stroke, and is contraindicated in cases of severe renal insufficiency. Although arterial spin labeling can be used to measure perfusion deficits noninvasively, it is usually used for imaging cerebral blood flow. Cerebral blood flow is more difficult to be visually interpreted as prolonged mean transit time (MTT) obtained by DSC-PWI , as recommended by the guidelines for acute stroke imaging . Cerebral blood flow also has lower intrinsic signal to noise than MTT for accurate volume measurement . Finally, volume measurements of the DWI and PWI lesions for quantifying the mismatch are currently performed through manual outlining, which is tedious and unreliable among observers, and may in turn lead to inaccurate clinical characterization of the individual patient and underpowered clinical trials . Thus, overcoming these drawbacks may require standardized and automatic approaches to obviate the need for manually delineating the volumes.
