Positron emission tomography (PET), commonly performed in conjunction with computed tomography (CT), has revolutionized oncologic imaging. PET/CT has become the standard of care for the initial staging and assessment of treatment response for many different malignancies. Despite this success, PET/CT is often supplemented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which offers superior soft-tissue contrast and a means of assessing cellular density with diffusion-weighted imaging. Consequently, PET/MRI, the newest clinical hybrid imaging modality, has the potential to provide added value over PET/CT or MRI alone. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the current body of literature pertaining to the clinical performance of PET/MRI, with the aim of summarizing current evidence and identifying gaps in knowledge to direct clinical expansion and future research. Multiple example cases are also provided to illustrate the central findings of these publications.

## Introduction

Positron emission tomography (PET) has revolutionized the imaging evaluation of numerous oncologic conditions by exploiting biochemical and physiologic differences between tumor cells and normal tissues . Often performed in conjunction with computed tomography (CT), PET utilizing the glucose analog 2-deoxy-2-\[  18 F\]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become the standard of care for the initial staging and the subsequent assessment of treatment response for many malignancies . Tumor uptake of FDG reflects the increased rates of aerobic glycolysis that occur in many cancer cells (the Warburg effect) relative to most normal tissues and benign lesions. The resulting distribution of FDG thereby allows for anatomic delineation of local and distant tumor spread by PET/CT and provides a measure of a key aspect of cancer metabolism. Many PET tracers have also been developed to take advantage of other distinctive tumor properties, such as elevated amino acid transport or altered receptor expression .

Despite its proven utility, FDG-PET/CT has important limitations, especially with respect to local tumor staging and the characterization of certain incidental lesions. In such situations, further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated to achieve optimal clinical management. The superb soft-tissue contrast of MRI and its capacity to assess cellular density by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) constitute powerful supplements to the molecular and metabolic data of PET. Consequently, PET/MRI, the newest clinical hybrid imaging modality, has significant potential to improve the diagnosis, initial staging, and subsequent restaging of numerous cancers. However, studies demonstrating such benefits are needed to support the routine clinical use of PET/MRI, particularly to justify the added expense and complexity of PET/MRI instead of PET/CT. This review aims to summarize the current body of evidence in support of PET/MRI, as well as current challenges and gaps in knowledge, and to identify oncologic conditions likely to benefit from its clinical use. We also present case examples to illustrate specific advantages of PET/MRI. Overall, this article should familiarize the reader with the current clinical applications of PET/MRI in oncology and provide an overview of the specific scenarios in which PET/MRI may provide added value over PET/CT or MRI alone.

## Current Challenges

## Technical Considerations

Before delving into the clinical evidence, it is essential to discuss briefly the technical development of PET/MRI, so as to understand some of the inherent advantages, challenges, and limitations. The earliest approach to combining PET and MRI data was through software fusion of PET or PET/CT images with separately acquired MRI. The first combined apparatuses were _sequential_ PET/MRI systems that consisted of individual PET and MRI elements connected by a common table. The newer _integrated_ PET/MRI systems acquire PET and MRI data simultaneously in the same bore. This latter strategy may improve scanning efficiency and reduce misregistration but requires technical adaptations of the PET components; additionally, both _sequential_ and _integrated_ PET/MRI systems require a novel method to correct for the attenuation of PET photons .

Whereas the CT component of PET/CT directly provides electron density information that can be readily used to generate attenuation-corrected PET images, the MRI signal acquired during simultaneous PET/MRI instead correlates with proton density and tissue T1/T2 properties. Current approaches to MRI-based attenuation correction (AC) include segmentation-based and atlas-based methods . Segmentation-based AC is used clinically and relies on the Dixon method to classify voxels as soft tissue (i.e., muscle and solid organs), fat, lung, or air. In contrast to the atlas-based method, which fits pre-existing averaged imaging data sets to an acquired study and is currently used mainly in the research setting, the segmentation-based method uses each patient's own imaging data and thus can account for large tumors, postsurgical changes, anatomic variants, and other findings not readily incorporated into imaging atlases. However, segmentation-based AC has its own set of limitations. Cortical bone, which attenuates PET photons more than soft tissue, does not provide adequate signal to be represented in AC maps derived from the current clinically available MRI-based segmentation methods. Consequently, cortical bone is not accounted for by the standard Dixon method, resulting in lower standardized uptake values (SUVs) for tissues within or immediately adjacent to cortical bone when assessed by PET/MRI compared to PET/CT . Segmentation of the lung parenchyma can occasionally fail due to the relative lack of protons available to provide MR signal compared to fat or soft tissue, resulting in artifacts that propagate into the attenuation-corrected PET images and may compromise interpretation . Additionally, patient-positioning devices, such as the headphones routinely used in brain MRI, can also artifactually lower SUVs derived from MR-based AC methods . In general, compared to CT-based AC, the maximum reductions in SUV measurements derived from MR-based AC are typically on the order of 10–20%, although the diagnostic impact of this SUV underestimation on routine clinical oncologic imaging with PET/MRI appears to be relatively minor.

## Workflow Optimization and Protocol Design

Given the relative novelty of PET/MRI, no standardized acquisition protocols exist. This protocol variability throughout the PET/MRI literature can make comparing the results of different studies challenging. Importantly, protocol optimization and sequence selection have been extensively described in the literature (  Table 1 ). Regardless of the acquisition details, there are basic principles that should apply to clinical protocol development: (1) PET/MRI protocols should be designed to compete with PET/CT in terms of examination duration, and (2) PET/MRI protocols should be tailored to the clinical question at hand, with the goal of creating added value beyond what PET/CT or MRI alone might otherwise provide. At our institution, initial staging studies generally include both whole-body sequences aimed at identifying distant metastases and high-resolution, anatomically focused MR sequences in the region of the primary tumor to facilitate assessment of local invasion and detection of regional metastases.

![Figure 2, 69-year-old man with known metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma presented for restaging. Sagittal computed tomography (CT) images (a) revealed a subtle lytic lesion within the T2 vertebral body ( arrow head ) but a normal appearance of the T5 vertebral body ( arrow ). Sagittal CT images with 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) fusion (b) demonstrated an FDG-avid focus in the T2 ( arrowhead ) vertebral body highly suspicious for metastatic disease. In contrast, a focus of more subtly increased FDG uptake in the T5 vertebral body ( arrow ) without a CT correlate was felt to be indeterminate, as both metastatic disease and degenerative disease could conceivably produce this appearance. Sagittal T1-weighted images (T1WIs) (c) from subsequent PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed clear evidence of marrow replacement in the T2 ( arrowhead ) and T5 ( arrow ) vertebral bodies. Corresponding foci of FDG avidity on sagittal T1WIs with FDG-PET fusion (d) strongly supported the presence of metastases at both sites. These images show an example of the improved anatomic delineation of malignant osseous disease with PET/MRI relative to PET/CT, as well as the power of PET/MRI to distinguish osseous malignancy from degenerative remodeling.

![Figure 3, 8-year-old girl with suspected recurrent small cell glioma presented for restaging. (a) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1WIs) showed a heterogeneous mass ( arrows ) centered in the right basal ganglia. Multiple small nonenhancing areas ( asterisks ) interspersed among numerous enhancing foci were noted. (b) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1WIs with 6-[ 18 F]fluoro-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylalanine-positron emission tomography (FDOPA-PET) fusion revealed avid tracer uptake by the enhancing and nonenhancing portions of this mass ( arrows ), illustrating transport of the FDOPA tracer into areas of tumor involvement where the blood-brain barrier was still intact. (c) Transaxial T2-weighted images (T2WIs) acquired with a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence demonstrated abnormal T2 prolongation within the entire area of increased FDOPA uptake ( arrows ), further supporting tumor infiltration into these regions. Tumor invasion into the right temporal lobe ( asterisks ) was also suspected, although without a corresponding focus of FDOPA uptake. This case highlights one of the advantages of PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relative to MRI alone in the setting of neuro-oncology, as certain tracers can enter the central nervous system to delineate tumor involvement in anatomic regions where the blood-brain barrier remains intact.

(c) Transaxial T1WIs demonstrated subtle enlargement of the left mandibular foramen ( arrow ) compared to the contralateral side ( not shown ). These findings were consistent with recurrent malignancy and perineural spread along the expected course of the left inferior alveolar nerve, a diagnosis that likely would have been challenging with PET/computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) alone. In this regard, PET/MRI can facilitate accurate T staging of head and neck carcinoma.

![Figure 5, 60-year-old woman with a remote history of treated cervical cancer was referred from an outside institution for evaluation of a lung mass. (a) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1WIs) revealed a spiculated right parahilar lung mass ( asterisk ) with mediastinal invasion and near-encasement of the superior vena cava ( arrow ). (b) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1WIs with 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) fusion at this same level showed the lesion ( asterisk ) to be hypermetabolic and also identified metastatic lesions of the thoracic spine ( arrowhead ) and left lung hilum ( arrow ). (c) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1WIs obtained at a more superior level demonstrated lateral extension of the right parahilar lung mass ( asterisk ) with invasion of the chest wall ( arrow ). (d) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1WIs with FDG-PET fusion at this same level revealed additional sites of metastatic disease in the right ( arrowhead ) and left ( arrow ) aspects of the mediastinum. Subsequent computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy was positive for squamous cell carcinoma. Given the imaging appearance of the right parahilar mass and the distribution of FDG-avid lymph nodes, these findings were favored to represent metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma rather than recurrence of the patient's treated cervical cancer. These images demonstrate the utility of PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting and characterizing mediastinal and chest wall invasion by intrathoracic malignancies.

(a) Transaxial computed tomography (CT) images of the liver revealed small hypodense lesions ( arrows ) that were deemed too small to characterize. Positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) was subsequently performed for further evaluation. (b) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1WIs) obtained in the hepatocellular phase of contrast demonstrated two hypoenhancing foci ( arrows ) near the liver dome. (c) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1WIs with 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG)-PET fusion showed no definite FDG-avid correlate for these lesions ( arrows ), likely because of their small size and relatively low FDG uptake compared to normal liver. (d) However, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) revealed marked diffusion restriction within these lesions ( arrows ) compatible with hypercellular hepatic metastases. This case demonstrates how PET/MRI, when incorporating DWI of the liver, can increase the conspicuity of (and likely also the sensitivity for) hepatic metastases, relative to PET/CT.

(a) Transaxial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (T1WIs) of the liver revealed numerous arterially enhancing foci throughout the hepatic parenchyma ( arrows ) and at the site of previous segment VIII wedge resection ( arrowhead ). (b) Transaxial T2-weighted images (T2WIs) with DOTANOC-positron emission tomography (PET) fusion demonstrated significant tracer accumulation within the liver parenchyma ( arrows ) and at the site of prior surgical resection ( arrowhead ). DOTANOC binds to somatostatin receptor subtypes 2, 3, and 5, which are expressed by many neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This case illustrates how the molecular properties of tumors can be exploited by radiotracers to ensure that an abnormality identified on an anatomic image in fact represents the tumor of interest rather than a benign neoplasm or a second unrelated malignancy.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/PETMRI/6_1s20S1076633215004171.jpg)

Differential considerations included nodal metastases, left ovarian metastases, and physiological ovarian uptake. PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was subsequently performed for further evaluation. Transaxial high-resolution T2-weighted images (T2WIs) (b) with FDG-PET fusion (d) revealed ovoid structures with internal T2-hyperintense cystic spaces compatible with ovaries. There was significant FDG uptake on the right ( arrow ) and trace FDG uptake on the ( left ), similar to the PET findings from the PET/CT examination. Consequently, nodal metastases were excluded from the differential. As with the prior case, the superior soft-tissue contrast of PET/MRI relative to PET/CT also promotes accurate N staging of gynecologic malignancies.

The fat plane between the urinary bladder (bl) and the vagina was preserved, indicating bladder sparing.

These images demonstrate the ability of PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect tumor spread to lymph nodes that might not appear suspicious on MRI alone because of their normal size and/or morphology, potentially resulting in clinically significant upstaging.
