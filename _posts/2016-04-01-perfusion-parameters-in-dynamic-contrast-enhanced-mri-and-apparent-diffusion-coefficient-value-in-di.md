## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the association of prognostic factors and subtypes of breast cancer with perfusion parameters in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.

## Materials and Methods

Quantitative perfusion parameters (constant of transfer from plasma to interstitium, constant of transfer from the interstitium to the plasma, extravascular/extracellular volume per unit of volume of tissue \[v  e \], and initial area under the concentration curve \[  i AUC\]) and ADC values in the entire tumor volume of 52 invasive ductal carcinomas were obtained using histogram analysis. Four measures (25th percentile, mean, median, 75th percentile) were calculated for each parameter and the ADC value. Associations of perfusion parameters and ADC values with prognostic factors and tumor subtypes were analyzed.

## Results

Among perfusion parameters,  i AUC  mean and  i AUC  median were greater in tumors larger than 2 cm (8.23 ± 2.33, 8.64 ± 2.67 × 10  4 ) than in those smaller than 2 cm (6.99 ± 1.92, 7.04 ± 2.15 × 10  4 ; _P_ = 0.046, 0.023). V  e median was higher in tumors with progesterone receptor (PR) positivity (0.54 ± 0.18) than in those with PR negativity (0.44 ± 0.1, _P_ = 0.041). There were higher ADC  mean and ADC  median in tumors with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positivity (1.306 and 1.278 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s) than in those with HER2 negativity (1.078 and 1.053 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s; _P_ = 0.012 and 0.020). Higher ADC  mean and ADC  median were observed in HER2-enriched type (1.404 and 1.378 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s) than in luminal type (1.096 and 1.073 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s; _P_ = 0.030 and 0.045).

## Conclusions

Among perfusion parameters,  i AUC was associated with tumor size and v  e median was associated with PR positivity. Mean and median ADC values showed positive correlation with HER2-positive and HER2-enriched tumors.

## Introduction

Biopsy specimens are required for analysis of conventional prognostic factors such as tumor size, axillary lymph node status, histologic grade, and molecular marker expression . The availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has prompted efforts to develop noninvasive MRI-based biomarkers to predict the prognosis of breast cancers using techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Various apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) parameters derived from DWI and perfusion parameters obtained from DCE-MRI have been associated with several prognostic factors , and recent studies have also reported correlations between pharmacokinetic parameters of breast DCE-MRI and prognostic factors, suggesting poorer prognosis in tumors with higher constant of transfer from plasma to interstitium (K  trans ) and constant of transfer from the interstitium to the plasma (k  ep ) values or lower extravascular/extracellular volume per unit of volume of tissue (v  e ) values . However, to our knowledge, there have been no studies so far that have analyzed both perfusion parameters and ADC values in the entire tumor volume for simultaneous correlation of prognostic factors or subtypes. The purpose of our study was to investigate the association of prognostic factors and tumor subtypes in patients diagnosed with breast cancer to both MR perfusion parameters and ADC values. In addition, we compared histogram analysis and region of interest (ROI) analysis for the prediction of prognosis of breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study, and informed consent was waived. Between February 2012 and March 2013, 81 consecutive breast cancer patients diagnosed by percutaneous biopsy underwent DCE-MRI and DWI on a 3T MRI system for preoperative evaluation. Among them, a total of 29 patients were excluded because they had received preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( _n_ = 12), had histologic types other than invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) ( _n_ = 11), or due to processing software failure ( _n_ = 6). Finally, a total of 52 masses from 52 patients (mean age 54.8 years, range 36–72 years) were included in the analysis of perfusion parameters and ADC values.

![Figure 1, Two methods of three-dimensional semiautomatic volume segmentation in the same patient are shown on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CE T1WI). (a) Commercially available software (Olea Sphere 2.3) was used for the calculation of perfusion parameters. By placing a cursor on a representative axial slice, automatic segmentation of volumes of interest (VOIs) was performed in the entire tumor based on pixel intensities. (b) CE T1WI was used on the original images to estimate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values using the software ( left ). By drawing three regions of interest (ROIs) on representative axial, coronal, and sagittal contrast-enhanced T1WI ( middle ), total tumor volume was automatically reconstructed ( right ). This VOI was copied and applied to the ADC map for the calculation of ADC values.

![Figure 2, 47-year-old woman presented with right invasive ductal carcinoma, luminal type. The tumor showed relatively high mean initial area under the concentration curve ( i AUC mean ) (10.50 × 10 4 ) and low mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC mean ) values (0.964 × 10 −3 mm 2 /s). Other tumor characteristics were as follows: tumor size, 2.2 cm; axillary lymph node metastasis, absent; histologic grade, 3; estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), positive; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), negative; Ki-67, 25%; volume of interest (VOI) mean of constant of transfer from plasma to interstitium (K trans ), 0.851; VOI mean of extravascular/extracellular volume per unit of volume of tissue (v e ), 0.520; and VOI mean of constant of transfer from the interstitium to the plasma (k ep ), 1.773, respectively. (a) Contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted images (T1WI) demonstrated an irregular enhancing mass in the right breast. A K trans -based perfusion map (b) and an ADC map (c) , volume segmentation on the ADC map (d) , and the histogram of the ADC values (e) in the whole tumor are displayed.
