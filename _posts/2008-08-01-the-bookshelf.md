With the explosion of information both in print and online, I am always looking for a resource that will maximize the efficiency with which I can acquire and review pertinent information. This book is part of a volume in Thieme's new _Teaching Atlas_ series presented in a case-based format to address representative problems encountered, both vascular and nonvascular, in the practice of interventional radiology.

The book is structured as a series of cases with the following format. Each case begins with the clinical presentation, which is followed by the noninvasive and invasive examinations used in diagnosis and treatment of each disease. A specific diagnosis is then provided. Two central sections account for a majority of the written information and are divided into treatment (a shortened version of the operative dictation) and discussion (addressing the background of the disease, workup, treatment options, complications, and synopsis of the published literature regarding the case). Each case is finished with “pearls and pitfalls” and recommended further reading.

The provided history is “real life.” Images are of good quality, conveying the necessary information and key portions of the diagnosis and treatment. A diagnosis is provided, and discussion focuses on the disease process of the case, leaving a discussion of extended differentials to other resources. The treatment section efficiently addresses the range of options and gives that reader the information to make appropriate decisions.

The last several sections are where this book excels. Possible complications, published literature, and pearls and pitfalls walk the perfect line by providing enough information to be extremely useful without inundating the reader with low-yield facts.

This book provides a straightforward approach to many of the common problems that are part of interventional radiology. A systematic approach and technical detail provided in each case allow the book to provide utility across the spectrum of medical professionals, including the experienced and novice interventionalist as well as the referring physician. The inclusion of pearls and pitfalls in each case facilitates a quick review for those preparing for board exams. For those looking for a highly efficient and detailed review of the most common vascular and several nonvascular interventional procedures, this book proves to be an excellent resource.
