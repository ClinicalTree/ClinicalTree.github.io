## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to develop and validate a method for measuring the depth of tumor invasion (DoI) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to investigate the diagnostic performance of the measured DoI for stratifying tumor (T) classification in patients with distal bile duct cancer according to the new American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty-four patients (30 men and 24 women; age range, 43–81 years) with distal bile duct cancer were enrolled. A study coordinator first developed a “provisional method” for measuring DoI on T2-weighted MRI. Subsequently, after compensating for defects, the “improved method” was developed. Two reviewers independently measured DoI and assessed its correlations with the histopathologic reference standard using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The study population was grouped according to the DoI for T classification based on the new staging system for evaluation of diagnostic predictive values.

## Results

The ICC values between the radiologic and the histopathologic DoI were calculated. Using the “improved method,” the ICC for the coordinator's DoI was very good (ICC, 0.885), which was a significantly higher value than that obtained using the “provisional method” (ICC, 0.501, _P_ = .00000); and for two reviewers' DoIs, the ICC values were good (ICC, 0.752 and 0.784, respectively). The overall accuracy of MRI for stratifying bile duct tumors using DoI was 87.0% and 85.2%, respectively.

## Conclusions

This newly developed method reliably measured DoI on T2-weighted MRI and can be used for preoperative T classification of patients with distal bile duct cancer according to the new staging system.

## Introduction

Bile duct carcinoma is an uncommon neoplasm that accounts for 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers worldwide , and distal bile duct cancer accounts for 20%–30% of all bile duct carcinomas . Despite advances in surgical techniques and the introduction of developed oncologic modalities, the overall prognosis of bile duct cancer remains poor. As for other gastrointestinal tumors, tumor (T) classification is a major prognostic indicator in bile duct cancer. However, several studies have reported problems with T-staging using the seventh or former editions of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system . According to these systems, the T1 and T2 stages of distal bile duct cancer are distinguished on the basis of the extent of tumor within or beyond the bile duct wall, and T2 and T3 stages are distinguished on the basis of the presence or absence of adjacent organ invasion, including invasion of the gallbladder, duodenum, and pancreas . However, it has been noted that the staging system using descriptive extent of tumor invasion is associated with certain problems from both histopathologic and clinical aspects. For these reasons, several studies have suggested an alternative T-staging system using the depth of tumor invasion (DoI) to overcome the problems of the old T classification system , and the primary tumor staging of distal bile duct cancer in the eighth AJCC staging system was changed accordingly . In the new staging system, the definitions of T1, T2, and T3 have been revised based on measured DoI, which is better for predicting patient outcome and allows more reproducible measurements.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and multidetector computed tomography are useful modalities for the preoperative evaluation of bile duct cancer in terms of diagnosis, characterization, localization, and staging . For the diagnosis of bile duct cancer, information regarding the extent of the tumor and its resectability obtained with contrast-enhanced MRI and magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography shows a diagnostic performance similar to information obtained using multidetector computed tomography and direct cholangiography . However, MRI is better than computed tomography for the visualization of intraductal lesions and the assessment of lateral extensions of extrahepatic bile duct cancer because of its superior contrast resolution and recent advances in MRI techniques. If the DoI of bile duct cancer can be accurately assessed using preoperative MRI, it might be used as a prognostic indicator.
