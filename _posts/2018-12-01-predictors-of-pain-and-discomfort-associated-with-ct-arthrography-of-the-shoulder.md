## Rationale and Objectives

The objective of this study was to investigate predictors of pain associated with computed tomographic arthrography of the shoulder.

## Materials and Methods

Before shoulder arthrography, all participants were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Short Version Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF). The participants were nonrandomized into two groups: the anesthesia group, who underwent prior local infiltration anesthesia before shoulder arthrography, and the nonanesthesia group, who did not undergo prior local infiltration anesthesia. The pain levels at intraprocedure, at 1, 2, 6, and 12 hours, and at 1 and 2 days after injection were assessed by using a visual analog scale. Univariate and multivariate generalized linear model analyses were conducted.

## Results

Sixty participants in the anesthesia group and 60 participants in the nonanesthesia group were included. The pain level at intraprocedure (3.37 ± 1.94 in the anesthesia group and 3.20 ± 1.34 in the nonanesthesia group) was the highest of the whole pain course. The psychological domain ( _P_ = .0013) of WHOQOL-BREF, gender ( _P_ = .042), body mass index ( _P_ = .0001), and the total number of reinsertion and redirection of needle ( _P_ < .0001) were independent predictors of arthrography-related pain.

## Conclusions

The pain associated with shoulder computed tomographic arthrography depends on the psychological domain of WHOQOL-BREF, gender, body mass index, and the total number of reinsertion and redirection of needle.

## Introduction

Computed tomographic arthrography (CTA) is a well-established imaging method for evaluating shoulder disorders and normal variants , which include rotator cuff tears, capsulolabral complex lesions and variants, osseous and cartilage lesions, and postoperative pathology. Since the early 2000s, commercialized multidetector computed tomography with a capacity to acquire a large imaging volume of isotropic submillimeter voxels within a short scan time, which could be reformatted in multiplane with high spatial resolution, has substantially improved the diagnostic performance of CTA and broadened its applications in the musculoskeletal system . Shoulder arthrography is an invasive procedure in which contrast media is injected into the joint via a needle. Side effects of this procedure, especially for arthrography-related pain and discomfort, have often been reported . The pain is rated mild or fairly severe, which usually lasts for several days. According to a biopsychosocial model, perception of pain is not only correlated with biological factors but also affected by social and psychological factors . The complete predictors of pain associated with CTA, including social and psychological factors, are of interest for radiologists and referring physicians to educate patients. During a shoulder geometry study using the CTA technique , we designed a concomitant prospective study to investigate predictors of pain associated with CTA of the shoulder.

## Materials and Methods

## Participants

This prospective nonrandomized study was approved and supervised by the institutional review board (IRB) with written informed consent from every participant. As part of a previously IRB-approved study at our institution, 134 volunteers were recruited to undergo CTA of the shoulder to study proximal humerus anatomy. Each volunteer was paid $75 for participation. An additional study was appended to the existing IRB approval to examine the predictors of pain associated with shoulder CTA. To evaluate the potential influence of local infiltration anesthesia during shoulder arthrography, participants were assigned into either the anesthesia group or the nonanesthesia group. Participants were excluded from the study if they had bone or soft tissue abnormalities on CTA; withdrew from an ongoing study; had taken analgesics such as acetaminophen or NSAIDs to relieve postarthrographic pain; had unsuccessful arthrography; were unavailable for a telephone interview; or were uncooperative to fill out anxiety, depression, and quality of life questionnaires.
