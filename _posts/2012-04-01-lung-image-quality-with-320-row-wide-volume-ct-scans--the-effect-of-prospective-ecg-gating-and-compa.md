## Rationales and Objectives

To evaluate the image quality of 320-row wide-volume (WV) computed tomography (CT) scans in comparison with 64-row helical scans for the lung.

## Materials and Methods

The Institutional Review Board of each institution approved this prospective, multicenter study and informed consent was obtained. A total of 73 subjects underwent two types of chest CT, including 320-row WV scans and 64-row helical scans. Both scans used the same tube voltage, tube current, exposure time setting, and slice thickness. The helical scans were not electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated. For the WV scans, prospective ECG-gating was used for 38 subjects, whereas the other 35 subjects did not have ECG-gating. Using a 5-point scale from 1 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (excellent), three blinded observers independently evaluated image quality for five lobes and the lingula. The differences in the scores between WV scans and helical scans were compared using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test.

## Results

The WV scans with ECG-gating had significantly higher scores than 64-row helical scans for all lobes and lingula (right lower lobe, _P_ < .01; other lobes and lingula, _P_ < .0001, respectively). The 320-row WV scans without ECG-gating also had significantly higher scores than 64-row helical scans ( _P_ < .05), except for nonsignificant differences for the left upper lobe.

## Conclusions

Lung image quality of ECG-gated WV scans, which do not require any additional radiation exposure, is better than that of non–ECG-gated 64-row helical scans. Non–ECG-gated 320-row WV scans are comparable or slightly superior to non–ECG-gated 64-row helical scans.

A 320-row multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scanner provides a unique scanning method, known as wide-volume (WV) scanning, as well as conventional 64-row helical scanning. The 320-row WV scan is characterized by a long scan field (16-cm length) using a single gantry rotation (step-and-shoot scanning), which makes it possible to obtain volumetric scan data for the entire lung with a few rotations during a single breathhold. In addition, when combined with prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gating (triggering), ECG-gated images are obtained without additional radiation exposure.

Although some studies have demonstrated the image quality of 320-row MDCT scans of the heart, brain, and abdominal vessels , published information on 320-row WV scans of the lung is very limited : it remains unclear whether 320-row WV scans have better image quality than 64-row helical scans for depicting the lung field.

![Figure 1, Illustrations of 64-row helical scanning and 320-row wide volume scanning. For 64-row helical scanning (a) , the beam pitch is 0.828 (helical pitch of 53) with a collimation of 0.5 mm × 64, resulting in 12 to 16 gantry rotations for the entire chest. For 320-row wide volume scanning (b) , the detector collimation is 0.5 mm × 320 or ×280 and a series of three rotations covers the entire chest. Note that prospective electrocardiogram (ECG)-gating does not change the total number of gantry rotations, thus requiring the same radiation dose as non–ECG-gated wide-volume scans.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LungImageQualitywith320rowWidevolumeCTScansTheEffectofProspectiveECGgatingandComparisonswith64rowHelicalCTScans/0_1s20S1076633211005976.jpg)

On a 64-helical CT image (a) , relatively large motion blurs are observed along the margins of the heart ( arrowheads ). The bronchial walls in the left lower lobes are also blurred ( arrows ). Final scores were as follows: four for the right middle lobe; five for the right lower lobe; three for the left lingula; and four for the left lower lobe. On an ECG-gated 320-row wide-volume image (b) , no major motion blur is observed and the bronchial walls in the left lower lobes are clearly visualized. Final scores were five for all lobes and the lingula. Note that these scores for each lobe or the lingula were determined after observing all images including the lobe (lingula), not based on a single image. Also, helical and wide-volume scans for the same subject were randomly presented to the readers from a total of 146 CT scans, which were not shown contiguously or side by side on the screen.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/LungImageQualitywith320rowWidevolumeCTScansTheEffectofProspectiveECGgatingandComparisonswith64rowHelicalCTScans/1_1s20S1076633211005976.jpg)
