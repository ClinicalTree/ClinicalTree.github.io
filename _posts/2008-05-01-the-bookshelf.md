The book is divided into eight chapters covering the carotid and vertebral basilar circulations as well as the arch vessels and intracranial venous and arterial circulations. The text uses three-dimensional catheter angiography with two-dimensional comparison angiography as well as color illustrations to detail the vascular anatomy. Each chapter is prefaced by a short text describing the key points to the following anatomic region. The anatomy is presented in a thorough and easy-to-use format. Each page contains high-quality pictures, a figure key, and a reference picture (providing the angle of projection). Examples of aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, fistulas, and tumors are presented within the book. This is an excellent book for practicing radiologists. The book is especially helpful to those who are involved with diagnostic computed angiography, diagnostic angiography, or interventional neuroradiology.
