## Highlights

- Advanced modeled iterative reconstruction causes substantial reductions of coronary artery calcium scores.

- Coronary artery calcium may no longer be detectable using advanced modeled iterative reconstruction, especially in patients with low calcium burden.

- Advanced modeled iterative reconstruction should be used with caution in coronary artery calcium scanning.


## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the influence of advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) on the coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores by computed tomography (CT).
