## Purpose

This study aimed to compare the diagnostic values of a combination of diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted imaging (DWI-T2WI) with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), and to evaluate the correlation of DWI with the histologic grade in breast cancer.

## Materials and Methods

This study evaluated a total of 169 breast lesions from 136 patients who underwent both DCE-MRI and DWI (b value, 1000s/mm  2 ). Morphologic and kinetic analyses for DCE-MRI were classified according to the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System. For the DWI-T2WI set, a DWI-T2WI score for lesion characterization that compared signal intensity of DWI and T2WI (benign: DWI-T2WI score of 1, 2; malignant: DWI-T2WI score of 3, 4, 5) was used. The diagnostic values of DCE-MRI, DWI-T2WI set, and combined assessment of DCE and DWI-T2WI were calculated.

## Results

Of 169 breast lesions, 48 were benign and 121 were malignant (89 invasive ductal carcinoma, 24 ductal carcinoma in situ, 4 invasive lobular carcinoma, 4 mucinous carcinoma). The mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of invasive ductal carcinoma (0.92 ± 0.19 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s) and ductal carcinoma in situ (1.11 ± 0.13 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s) was significantly lower than the value seen in benign lesions (1.36 ± 0.22 × 10  −3 mm  2 /s). The specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and accuracy of DWI-T2WI set and combined assessment of DCE and DWI-T2WI (specificity, 87.5% and 91.7%; PPV, 94.3% and 96.2%; accuracy, Az = 0.876 and 0.922) were significantly higher than those of the DCE-MRI (specificity, 45.8%; PPV, 81.7%; accuracy, Az = 0.854; _P_ < .05). A low ADC value and the presence of rim enhancement were associated with a higher histologic grade cancer ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

Combining DWI, T2WI, and ADC values provides increased accuracy for differentiation between benign and malignant lesions, compared with DCE-MRI. A lower ADC value was associated with a higher histologic grade cancer.

## Introduction

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is currently being evaluated to increase the specificity of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . DWI is a noninvasive technique that uses the biological characteristics of Brownian movement of protons in water. High signal intensity (SI) on DWI and a low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value are correlated with highly cellular tissue and decreased movement of molecules . When DWI is used, malignant breast lesions have higher SI than with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) fast spin echo (FSE) MRI, and malignant breast lesions have low ADC values. Malignant breast lesions display lower SI on T2WI than benign lesions because of shorter T2 relaxation time . The high cellularity of cancer cell caused the restriction of Brownian motion in extracellular water molecules around cancer cells. In contrast, fluid in cysts consists of free water molecules and a higher ADC .

Multiple studies have evaluated DWI and ADC value for breast tumor and evaluated the diagnostic value of combined dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and DWI for breast cancer detection . The detectability on DWI was higher than T1WI or T2WI for breast tumor, and the mean ADC value of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) were lower than benign breast lesions. Kul et al. revealed the combination of DWI and DCE-MRI has the potential to increase the specificity of breast MRI. Another study reported that combined DCE-MRI and DWI had superior diagnostic accuracy than either DCE-MRI or DWI alone for the diagnosis of breast cancer . However, those studies did not compare each SI between DWI and T2WI for characterization of the lesion. In addition, those studies did not compare the accuracy of DWI-T2WI combination with that of DCE-MRI. In those studies, T2WI and DCE-MRI were used as pilot images for localizing the lesion. Thus, the purpose of our study is to compare the diagnostic values of a combination of DWI and T2WI with DCE-MRI, and to investigate the correlation of DWI, including ADC value, with the histologic grade in breast cancer lesions.
