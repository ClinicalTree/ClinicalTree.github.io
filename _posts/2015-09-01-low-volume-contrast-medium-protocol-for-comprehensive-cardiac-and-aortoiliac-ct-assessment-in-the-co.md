## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the diagnostic performance of a comprehensive computed tomography (CT) protocol for both cardiac and aortoiliac evaluation of patients considered for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using a single, low-volume contrast medium (CM) injection.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-four TAVR candidates were retrospectively analyzed. All underwent retrospectively electrocardiogram-gated cardiac CT followed by high-pitch CT angiography of the aortoiliac vasculature using one of two single injection protocols of 320 mgI/mL iodine CM: group A ( _n_ = 22), iodine delivery rate-based (1.28 gI/s), 60-mL CM volume, 4.0 mL/s flow rate; group B ( _n_ = 22), clinical routine protocol, 100-mL CM volume, 4.0 mL/s flow rate. Mean arterial attenuation, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. Subjective image quality was assessed.

## Results

Aortic root and iliofemoral dimensions could be analyzed in all cases. Patient characteristics showed no significant differences. Mean attenuation at the levels of the aortic root (285.8 ± 83.0 HU vs 327.5 ± 70.8 HU, _P_ = .080) and the iliofemoral access route (256.8 ± 88.5 HU vs 307.5 ± 93.2 HU, _P_ = .071), as well as SNR and CNR were nonsignificantly lower in group A compared to group B. Subjective image quality was equivalent.

## Conclusions

In multimorbid TAVR patients, the performance of a combined CT protocol using a single low-volume CM bolus is feasible with maintained image quality compared to a standard protocol.

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an emerging minimally invasive procedure for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis who are considered at high risk for surgical treatment . A comprehensive preprocedural diagnostic work-up is essential for patient selection and proper TAVR planning . In this context, computed tomography (CT) is increasingly gaining importance as it provides information on both aortic annular sizing for prosthesis deployment and the aortoiliac access route within a single examination . Compared to other imaging modalities, CT offers this information noninvasively with three-dimensional reconstructions possible and without interference by overlaying structures. However, CT protocols of multiple body regions typically require a considerable amount of contrast medium (CM) using a conventional single-source CT system .

While designing an optimal CT protocol for TAVR planning, it is important to consider three frequent comorbid conditions in patients considered for TAVR: atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and chronic renal dysfunction , as they have both technical and clinical implications. Atrial fibrillation is important in that it might lead to incorrect aortic root measurements caused by cardiac motion and electrocardiogram (ECG) misregistration. This can be ameliorated by using a retrospectively ECG-gated image acquisition mode, which can also account for the conformational changes of the aortic annulus over the cardiac cycle that influence prosthesis sizing . Congestive heart failure and renal insufficiency together increase the risk of volume overload and renal compromise. Therefore, minimizing CM volume is desirable .
