## Rationale and Objectives

To assess differences in excitatory (glutamate/glutamine or Glx) and inhibitory (γ-Aminobutyric acid or GABA) neurotransmitter levels using MR spectroscopy in pain processing regions of the brain in patients diabetic neuropathy (DN) and positive sensory symptoms and age-matched healthy control (HC) subjects.

## Materials and Methods

Seven diabetic patients (5 males, 2 females, mean age = 57.0 ± 8.5 years) with confirmed DN and positive sensory symptoms and 7 age and sex matched HC subjects (mean age = 57.7 ± 3.2 years) underwent 3 Tesla MR spectroscopy. Glx and GABA levels were quantified in the right anterior and posterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex and right thalamus.

## Results

Mean Glx levels were significantly higher and mean GABA levels were significantly lower within the posterior insula in the DN patients compared to HC ( _P_ = 0.005 and 0.012 respectively).

## Conclusions

This pilot data demonstrates an excitatory/inhibitory neurotransmitter imbalance in the brain of in patients with DN and positive sensory symptoms compared to pain free HC subjects.

## Summary

Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common complication of diabetes, affecting approximately 50% of diabetic patients and in at least half of these patients the neuropathy is associated with tingling, allodynia, hyperalgesia or frank pain. DN is traditionally considered a disease of the peripheral nervous system; however, there is emerging evidence for significant central nervous system modulation of symptoms of DN and painful DN in particular. Advanced neuroimaging methods provide a unique opportunity to study central nervous system factors in the setting of diabetic neuropathy, noninvasively and under physiologic conditions. Magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy in particular can provide important information regarding brain biochemistry. Alterations in N-acetyl aspartate within the thalamus have been reported in the context of diabetic neuropathy using conventional MR spectroscopy methods.

Glutamatergic (excitatory) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic (inhibitory) neurotransmission are thought to play a significant role within the pain processing pathways of the central nervous system. Glutamine (Glx) levels (combined glutamate and glutamine) can be measured using conventional MR techniques. GABA quantification using MR spectroscopy is not possible using conventional techniques because of signal overlap and low signal intensity. Elevated Glx levels within pain processing regions of the brain have been demonstrated in other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and migraine headaches. Until recently, there were no reports of brain GABA quantification in the setting of chronic pain; our group recently published the first report of GABA MR spectroscopy in fibromyalgia patients showing lower levels of GABA in the anterior insula in this patient population. Glx or GABA levels in the context of DN with or without associated pain have not been described in the literature. Our study provides the first report of Glx and GABA quantification in the brain of DN patients with positive sensory symptoms including pain at rest and reveals elevated Glx and reduced GABA levels in the insula, similar to previously reported findings in other chronic pain states.
