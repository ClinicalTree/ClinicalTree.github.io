## Rationale and Objectives

To assess resources available to junior faculty in US academic radiology departments for research mentorship and funding opportunities and to determine if certain resources are more common in successful programs.

## Materials and Methods

An anonymous survey covering scientific environment and research mentorship and was sent to vice-chairs of research of radiology departments. Results were evaluated to identify practices of research programs with respect to mentorship, resources, and opportunities. Academy of Radiology Research's 2012 National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants and awards list was used to determine if environment and practices correlate with funding.

## Results

There was a 51% response rate. A greater fraction of clinical faculty gets promoted from assistant to associate professor than research faculty. Research faculty overall submits more funding applications. Most programs support start-up costs and K-awards. Over half of the departments have a vice-chair for faculty development, and most have formal mentorship programs. Faculty members are expected to teach, engage in service, publish, and apply for and get research funding within 3 years of hire. Top-tier programs as judged by NIH awards have a combination of MDs who devote >50% effort to research and PhD faculty. Key factors holding back both clinical and research junior faculty development were motivation, resources, and time, although programs reported high availability of resources and support at the department level.

## Conclusions

Better marketing of resources for junior faculty, effort devoted to mentoring clinical faculty in research, and explicit milestones/expectations for achievement could enhance junior faculty success, promote interest in the clinician–scientist career path for radiologists, and lead to greater research success.

There is significant concern in the medical research community that there are not enough clinically trained scientists (specifically those with an MD, although overall it includes all allied health professionals) engaging in research, and if we want to sustain and increase the quality of research being conducted today, we need to find ways to improve our education, recruitment, and mentorship of these talented and creative individuals. Radiology is no exception to these concerns . A key aspect is training, and there has been a substantial amount of effort directed toward increasing research training and mentorship during residency . In radiology for example, the American Board of Radiology established in 1999 the Holman Research Pathway (HRP) to stimulate the development of future academic researchers and educators . To date, the program has trained a number of candidates (73 \[80%\] radiation oncology and 19 \[20%\] diagnostic radiology from 2002 to 2014) with a high percentage remaining in academic practice, obtaining research support and publishing results.

A key aspect of the HRP is mentorship, but most residents do not seem to identify mentors , and the question arises as to whether mentorship in general extends beyond residency to junior faculty . One recent study surveyed junior medical faculty to understand some of the factors that might be barriers to recruitment and retention of junior faculty . The study found that role models, a few years ahead of junior faculty, tend to increase commitment to academic careers, and that mentorship experiences during residency provide significant incentives to pursue an academic career. Interestingly they also found differences between men and women, with women noting a lack of researcher role models (midcareer, female researcher models), and overall men valued advice on finances, whereas women valued advice on work–life balance. Suggestions for the final point (work–life balance) included having a mentor closer in age to the mentee, having more than one mentor, and having mentors with similar values.
