## Rationale and Objectives

To compare two semiautomated methods for measurement of infarcted myocardium area on delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, with histopathology findings as standard of reference.

## Materials and Methods

Percentage area of myocardial infarction was measured in 10 Yorkshire landrace pigs manually and using two semiautomated methods. The first (standard deviation method) used two operator-selected regions of interest (ROIs) and nine different cutoff values (one to nine times the standard deviation of signal intensity in normal myocardium) to identify infarction. The second (threshold method) used threshold values based on percentages of maximum signal intensity to identify infarction. Results were compared with histopathology findings.

## Results

Difference between percentage area of infarction obtained with standard deviation method and autopsy specimens was in the range: −13.5% to +13.2%. With threshold method (thresholds from 30% to 90% of signal intensity), difference was −15% to +23%. Manual contouring underestimated infarcted area by 2% comparing to autopsy results. The best agreement between histopathology and semi-automated software was achieved for 4 standard deviations with standard deviation method: difference −0.45%, and for a percentage threshold of 70% (difference +0.67%) with threshold method. However, with standard deviation method, there was statistically significant difference between ROIs based on their location in viable myocardium: mean difference 1.7 ± 4%, _P_ < .0001.

## Conclusion

Semiautomated measurement of myocardial infarcted area on delayed enhanced magnetic resonance images performs well compared to autopsy. The threshold method, based on percentages of maximum signal intensity is preferable over standard deviation method, which is more susceptible to variability from location of ROIs within viable myocardium.

Delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (DE-MRI) is an established imaging technique for the identification of myocardial infarction in clinical practice . Quantification of the amount of infarction is desirable and was first attempted with manual methods which resulted in serious interobserver variability . Therefore dedicated software has been developed. However, there is no consensus on the best method for the automated quantitative estimation of the infarcted area based on DE-MRI images . Most commercially available software packages differentiate infarcted myocardium from viable myocardium using the standard deviation (SD) method. Generally, 2 SD above the mean signal intensity of the remote viable myocardium are used to identify the infarcted myocardium . However, local variations in signal intensity, which can occur using a surface coil, may introduce a bias when remote myocardial regions are used to calculate the segmentation threshold. More recently, another method for semiautomated segmentation was introduced . According to this method, a percentage of the maximum myocardial signal intensity is used as a threshold value to differentiate viable from infarcted myocardium. The threshold of 50% is referred to as full width at half maximum (FWHM). This technique is independent from regions of interest (ROIs) positioned in remote areas of viable myocardium. This method may be limited when the infarcted myocardium contains areas of microvascular obstruction, which appear as central dark zones within enhancing infarcted areas. However, regions of microvascular obstruction are generally easily recognized and the segmentation can be corrected manually.

In this study, we have addressed the influence of different cutoff values when using the SD method, and investigated the variability introduced by the position of the ROIs in areas of remote viable myocardium. Also, a newer semiautomated threshold method has been optimized using different cutoff values. Both methods have been compared with histopathology findings.
