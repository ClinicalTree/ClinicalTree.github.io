> What nobler employment, or more valuable to the state, than that of the man who instructs the rising generation. —Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BCE)

Even before Cicero's time, teachers have been widely regarded as invaluable members of society. In medicine, radiologists serve as consummate teachers, playing a crucial role in the education of peers, physicians-in-training, medical students, nurses, and other health care providers. However, few radiologists undergo any formal training in educational theory, methods, or assessment. Despite advances in educational theory related to generational changes in learning, most radiologists still use the traditional lecture format as a means to impart knowledge and case-based conferences to enable learners to apply their knowledge. Few radiologists have taken the time to reflect on their own teaching or to adopt more innovative approaches to teaching that might better meet the needs of their learners. Hence, most radiologists remain teacher-centered rather than learner-centered. As the members of every generation possess unique traits that enable them to acquire and apply knowledge differently, more effective teaching comes from a predominantly learner-centered approach . A better understanding of the generational differences between learners and their teachers can only result in more effective teaching . Many educators have come to recognize specific generational groups who share experiences, values, and identity shaped by world social and cultural events. In the past century, four discrete groups have been described: the silent generation (1928–1945), the baby boomers (1946–1964), generation X (1965–1982), and the millennial generation (1982–2000) (  Table 1 ). An awareness of intergenerational differences in teaching techniques and learning styles can affect teaching effectiveness and learners' mastery and application of medical information. With the rapid technological advances over the past two decades, millennial learners pose challenges for educators who are not as well versed in technology and do not share the same perspectives with regard to life, the world, and learning needs . Radiologists must evolve from the role of experts to millennial teachers, those who embrace generational understanding and use facilitation as a means of educating the next generation.

Generations of Learners


Generation Name Date Shaped by Silent generation 1928–1945 Great depression Baby boomer 1946–1964 World war II Generation X 1965–1982 Civil rights, women's rights, and Vietnam conflict Millennial 1983–present Technological advances including the Internet, cell phones, 9/11, and ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan

Millennial learners are “digital natives,” having had technology at their fingertips since birth . They possess unique skills on how to find information quickly and consequently tend to expect an immediate response to any query or concern, often relying on the Internet to obtain answers or closure to a question, and using technology for a majority of communication with friends and colleagues. This expectation for immediate answers results in impatience, a relatively short attention span (which can quickly lead to boredom), and a relative inability to perform deep critical thinking . Millennial learners tend to multitask and thrive in team-based or collaborative learning environments . They tend to be proficient at multiple tasks but do not necessarily become an expert in any one specific area. Millennial learners prefer structure and clear direction, and they welcome positive reinforcement as a means to their own success . They prefer experiential learning in a group setting and have a strong desire to succeed, whether or not there is innate talent that lies within . At times, this means that their enthusiasm and optimism must be tempered to reflect reality.

Given these common traits, how can one become an effective teacher of the millennial generation? Millennial teachers must first have a basic understanding of the beliefs and background of a millennial learner so that they can accommodate their teaching to reach this type of learner. Such a teacher must aim to _facilitate_ learning rather than solely function as the expert . Yet they must facilitate learning without setting lower expectations with regard to content and achievement. One aspect of effective facilitation entails a preassessment of learners' knowledge and gaps in understanding, which can readily be accomplished in the didactic setting by asking questions at the start of a session or polling the audience during the session. Effective facilitators also often tend to ask probing questions of their learners as part of their presentation as a means to stimulate and guide discussion. Millennial teachers must focus their efforts on teaching the application of knowledge, not merely imparting it. They must expect learners to actively participate in the learning process and embrace adult learning principles . Such principles rely on integrating new into existing knowledge and establishing the value and relevance of this new knowledge by allowing the learner to apply it to real-life situations . For example, in radiology, this might entail letting the learner interpret an image and integrate the findings into a cohesive impression with the teacher available for guidance as needed. Alternatively, the learner might be expected to perform an image-guided procedure with supervision and immediate feedback from the teacher. Both of these types of experiences already exist in most residency and fellowship training programs. However, there is great need for innovation in the didactic conference setting, where adult learning principles are not commonplace (  Table 2 ).
