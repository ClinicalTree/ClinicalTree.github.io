## Rationale and Objectives

For both airport baggage screeners and radiologists, low target prevalence is associated with low detection rate, a phenomenon known as “prevalence effect.” In airport baggage screening, the target prevalence is artificially increased with fictional weapons that are digitally superimposed on real baggage. This strategy improves the detection rate of real weapons and also allows airport supervisors to monitor screener performance. A similar strategy using fictional patients could be applied in radiology. The purpose of this study was twofold: (1) to review the psychophysics literature regarding low target prevalence and (2) to survey radiologists' attitudes toward using fictional patients as a quality assurance tool.

## Materials and Methods

We reviewed the psychophysics literature on low target prevalence and airport x-ray baggage screeners. An online survey was e-mailed to all members of the Association of University Radiologists to determine their attitudes toward using fictional patients in radiology.

## Results

Of the 1503 Association of University Radiologists member recipients, there were 153 respondents (10% response rate). When asked whether the use of fictional patients was a good idea, the responses were as follows: disagree (44%), neutral (25%), and agree (31%). The most frequent concern was the time taken away from doing clinical work (89% of the respondents).

## Conclusions

The psychophysics literature supports the use of fictional targets to mitigate the prevalence effect. However, the use of fictional patients is not a popular idea among academic radiologists.

## Introduction

When looking for a needle in a haystack, how do you know when you have missed the needle? Psychologists define “prevalence effect” as a phenomenon where one is more likely to miss a target that occurs with low frequency. When visually searching for something, decreased target prevalence leads to decreased target detection rate. In simple visual search tasks, a target prevalence of 1% is associated with a detection rate of only 70% . Prevalence effect is a problem for two occupations in particular: airport baggage screeners and radiologists, both of whom “spend the bulk of their time looking for things they rarely see.” Although not all radiology findings are rare, it is true that positive radiology findings are less common than normal findings. The radiology literature on the topic is sparse, but prevalence effect appears to be problematic for radiologists only when prevalence is below 1% . There are no existing radiology workflow strategies to mitigate the prevalence effect. Existing strategies to track radiologist misses are retrospective and therefore likely underestimate the number of misses.

How can airport baggage screeners and radiologists mitigate the prevalence effect? In one psychophysics paper from 2010, the authors concluded, “We want to reduce the error rates in real-life low-prevalence situations, such as airport baggage screening or X-ray examination in medical settings. Naturally, one may hope to do so by giving the workers stricter instructions. The present study suggests that such a method is probably futile. The only effective method is to randomly distribute some ‘pseudo-targets’ into the screening, thereby ensuring that, by gaining experience with such targets, workers will not miss real targets when they show up.”
