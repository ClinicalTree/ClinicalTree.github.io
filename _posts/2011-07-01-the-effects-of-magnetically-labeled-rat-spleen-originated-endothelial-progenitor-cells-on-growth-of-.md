## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exogenous endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) on the growth and invasiveness of glioma in vivo to provide an experimental basis for the value and safety of using magnetically labeled EPCs as target vectors to detect early infiltration of glioma.

## Materials and Methods

EPCs were collected from the spleens of healthy Sprague-Dawley rats, made EPCs conditioned medium after identification. Four models of Sprague-Dawley rat glioma (60 rats in total) were established as a control and three experimental groups (group A, B, and C). In the control group, orthotopic transplantation of C6 glioma cells was performed. Compared to the control group, EPCs conditioned medium was added in group A and P7228-labeled EPCs were added in group B. In group C, P7228-labeled EPCs were transplanted via the tail vein. Magnetic resonance imaging and perfusion-weighted imaging were performed on several days. Tumor microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were determined through immunohistochemistry.

## Results

In group C, hypointense areas were detected at the periphery of the tumor on the first day after transplantation of EPCs, and more hypointense areas were found inside the tumor over time. Tumor size in all four groups developed significantly with increasing time ( _P_ < .01), but there was no marked difference among these groups at the same time ( _P_ \> .05). No remarkable differences in microvascular density and cells positive for vascular endothelial growth factor were found at the same time among the four groups ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusions

Both magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical findings confirmed that exogenous EPCs could not affect the biologic behavior of C6 glioma cells in vivo through a paracrine effect or by direct cellular interaction. Therefore, exogenous EPCs could not exert significant promoting effects on glioma growth.

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), one kind of precursor cells that can proliferate and differentiate into mature endothelial cells in vitro, have sound proliferating and differentiating capacity. They not only participate in vasculogenesis at the embryonic stage but also play an important role in postnatal neovasculogenesis . EPCs can home in to a tumor site and incorporate into the tumor’s vascular endothelium. They can secrete angiogenic factors that promote tumor neovasculature. In light of the homing feature of EPCs and the biocompatibility of iron oxide–labeled nanomaterial molecular probes, the use of magnetically labeled EPCs as a magnetic resonance contrast agent to detect early brain glioma is promising. However, whether transplanted exogenous EPCs can promote the development of glioma has not been clearly clarified.

In this study, we performed orthotopic transplantation and transplantation via the tail vein of P7228-labeled EPCs and used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the distribution of EPCs in glioma tissue and their effects on the biologic behavior of tumors, such as growth and invasion, to provide an experimental basis for evaluating the clinical safety of using magnetically labeled EPCs in diagnosing early brain glioma.
