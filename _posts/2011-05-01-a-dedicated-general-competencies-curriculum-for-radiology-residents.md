## Rationale and Objectives

The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) through its Outcome Project requires training programs in all medical specialties to integrate six general competencies into residency training: patient care, medical knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice. In response, a required, or dedicated general competencies rotation for diagnostic radiology residents was instituted.

## Materials and Methods

We describe the development and implementation of this rotation. The rotation augments the core curriculum, with primary emphasis placed on resident-initiated quality improvement (QI) and quality assurance (QA) projects.

## Results

Between academic years 2003 and 2009 diagnostic radiology residents completed 38 QI/QA projects and performed clinical float coverage for the department. Residents met requirements of the systems-based practice and practice-based learning competency domains. In this process, residents improved their medical knowledge, interpersonal communication skills, professionalism, and provided patient care.

## Conclusions

A dedicated general competencies rotation can be successfully implemented, and complement the requirements of the core curriculum. In combination with coverage for clinical services, the rotation makes a substantive contribution to resident education to further the goal of improved patient care.

The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) through its Outcome Project requires training programs in all medical specialties to integrate six general competencies into residency training: patient care, medical knowledge, professionalism, interpersonal and communication skills, practice-based learning and improvement, and systems-based practice . The Outcome Project initiative has been phased in since 2001 with the expectation that after June 2011, full integration of the general competencies into program curricula will have occurred . In 2005, the Radiology Residency Review Committee revised training program requirements with input from the American Medical Association , American College of Radiology (ACR), and the American Board of Radiology, as well as the Association of Program Directors in Radiology . The new requisites include teaching and assessment of the six general competencies; curriculum innovation is encouraged. This article describes ongoing curriculum development and implementation of a general competencies rotation into the diagnostic radiology residency program of our department. The rotation augments the core curriculum, with primary emphasis placed on resident-initiated quality improvement (QI) and quality assurance (QA) projects.

## Methods

## Rotation Design

In response to the ACGME Outcomes mandate, an 8-week rotation designed to address components of the general competencies was created as a requirement of the core curriculum for University of Washington diagnostic radiology residents in 2003. Sited in Seattle at Harborview Medical Center (HMC), the major level 1 trauma center in a five-state region, the main program objective was to immerse residents in QI and QA processes. Support for the rotation is provided by the radiology department and institution to enhance the mission of HMC, not only as a major trauma center, but also as a safety-net hospital. As a safety-net hospital, HMC provides health care for the poor, uninsured, and most vulnerable in the community it serves . The volume and patient mix of this busy trauma center broadens learning opportunities for residents. The HMC emergency department (ED) radiologists and workstations are located physically within the ED. Residents gain enough exposure to operations in the radiology department, ED, and hospital to become cognizant of system shortcomings, problems, and redundancies—all potential topics for QI/QA projects.
