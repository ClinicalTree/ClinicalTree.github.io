## Rationale and Objectives

Focal epilepsies potentially can be cured by neurosurgery; other treatment options usually remain symptomatic. High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the central imaging strategy in the evaluation of focal epilepsy. The most common substrate of temporal epilepsies is hippocampal sclerosis (HS), which cannot always be sufficiently characterized with current MR field strengths. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to demonstrate the feasibility of high-resolution MR imaging at 7 Tesla in patients with focal epilepsy resulting from a HS and to improve image resolution at 7 Tesla in patients with HS.

## Materials and Methods

Six patients with known HS were investigated with T1-, T2-, T2  ∗ -, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery–weighted sequences at 7 Tesla with an eight-channel transmit-receive head coil. Total imaging time did not exceed 90 minutes per patient.

## Results

High-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla is feasible and reveals high resolution of intrahippocampal structures in vivo. HS was confirmed in all patients. The maximum non-interpolated in-plane resolution reached 0.2 × 0.2 mm  2 in T2  ∗ -weighted images. The increased susceptibility effects at 7 Tesla revealed identification of intrahippocampal structures in more detail than at 1.5 Tesla, but otherwise led to stronger artifacts. Imaging revealed regional differences in hippocampal atrophy between patients. The scan volume was limited because of specific absorption rate restrictions, scanning time was reasonable.

## Conclusions

High-resolution imaging at 7 Tesla is promising in presurgical epilepsy imaging. “New” contrasts may further improve detection of even very small intrahippocampal structural changes. Therefore, further investigations will be necessary to demonstrate the potential benefit for presurgical selection of patients with various lesion patterns in mesial temporal epilepsies resulting from a unilateral HS.

Although the causes of temporal lobe seizures are manifold, the most common finding in patients with severe, medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy is mesial temporal or hippocampal sclerosis (HS) . HS can occur either as a cause or consequence of focal epileptic seizures . Clinical and neuropathological findings, however, suggest different underlying etiologies and subsequent clinical presentations . Any changes of normal cortical architecture can be associated with severe epileptic syndromes, not restricted to the hippocampus. In general, epileptogenic lesions can be very small and either developmental or acquired.

Epilepsy patients are primarily treated pharmacologically to control seizures. But pharmacological treatment remains symptomatic and fails to sufficiently control seizures in about 20%–25% of patients . To date, the only curative treatment option is the neurosurgical resection of an epileptic lesion . Therefore, the precise presurgical anatomical and functional delineation of epileptogenic lesions by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging as well as by electroencephalographic studies is crucial for diagnosis and mandatory before surgical treatment. In addition, precise delineation of epileptic lesions in relation to functionally important surrounding structures such as eloquent areas, fiber tracts, or vessels may minimize surgical complications.
