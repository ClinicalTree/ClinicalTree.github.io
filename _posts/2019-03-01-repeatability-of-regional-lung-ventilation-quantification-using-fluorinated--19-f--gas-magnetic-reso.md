## Rationale and Objectives

To assess the repeatability of global and regional lung ventilation quantification in both healthy subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using fluorinated (  19 F) gas washout magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in free breathing.

## Material and Methods

In this prospective institutional review board-approved study, 12 healthy nonsmokers and eight COPD patients were examined with  19 F dynamic gas washout MR imaging in free breathing and with lung function testing. Measurements were repeated within 2 weeks. Lung ventilation was quantified using  19 F gas washout time. Repeatability was analyzed for the total lung and on a regional basis using the coefficient of variation (COV) and Bland–Altman plots.

## Results

In healthy subjects and COPD patients, a good repeatability was found for lung ventilation quantification using dynamic  19 F gas washout MR imaging on a global (COV < 8%) and regional (COV < 15%) level. Gas washout time was significantly increased in the COPD group compared to the healthy subjects.

## Conclusion

19 F gas washout MR imaging provides a good repeatability of lung ventilation quantification and appears to be sensitive to early changes of regional lung function alterations such as normal aging.

## Introduction

Functional pulmonary imaging to assess regional lung ventilation is a promising technique to further investigate lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in order to improve its diagnosis and treatment. Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is noninvasive, free of ionizing radiation, and offers several methods to probe lung function it has a high potential to be translated into clinical routine ( ).

Obviously, pulmonary gas MRI enables visualization of the respiratory tract and therefore provides regional information of lung ventilation ( ). To overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gas MRI arising from the lower spin-density and higher diffusivity, mainly hyperpolarized gases are proposed as pulmonary gas tracers ( ). Alternatively, fluorinated (  19 F) gases like sulfur hexafluoride (SF  6 ), tetrafluoromethane (CF  4 ), hexafluoroethane (C  2 F  6 ), and perfluoropropane (C  3 F  8 ) can be used at thermal polarization ( ). Fluorinated gases are nontoxic, chemically inert, and have a low solubility in water and blood. The relaxation of the fluorinated gases is dominated by spin–rotation interaction mediated by molecular collisions. Therefore, in a mixture with oxygen, which has a significantly lower molecular weight than the fluorinated gases, the collision rates increase and therefore T  1 and T  2 relaxation times of the fluorinated gases decrease with increasing concentration of oxygen ( ). Inhalation of a normoxic fluorinated gas mixture over several minutes did not show any adverse effects ( ). Their short longitudinal relaxation time T  1 (ranging from 1.8 ms for SF  6 up to 18 ms for C  3 F  8 at 1.5 T for the pure gas at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure) facilitates efficient  19 F gas MRI at short repetition times. Therefore, fluorinated gases provide sufficient SNR for pulmonary MRI in humans even at thermal polarization ( ).
