_The Teaching Files: Interventional_ is a case-based review of interventional radiology. The author, Dr. Charles Burke, a practicing interventionalist and faculty member at the University of North Carolina, covers a wide range of clinical scenarios, including: vascular and nonvascular interventions, customary and innovative interventional techniques, and potential complications of image-guided procedures. The text is designed to be used either as a standalone review book, or as a complement to the reference book _Image-Guided Interventions_ (which was published in 2008 under the Saunders Elsevier imprint).

The text is easily navigated, and is of appropriate length for a month-long clinical rotation or for use in a boards review setting. More than 300 cases are presented, with more than 1100 high-quality images included and clear explanations of the relevant teaching points. In general, there are two to four images for each clinical entity, ensuring a complete review of the pertinent imaging features. The case discussions are thorough and well organized, in that they typically are broken down in terms of clinical presentation/indications, the procedure performed, a summary of preprocedure imaging, relevant intraprocedural findings, and any pertinent information regarding follow-up and/or complications. The diagnostic questions probe the reader’s mastery of the material, which is as conducive to boards-readiness as it is to developing clinical judgment.

Notably, each copy of _The Teaching Files: Interventional_ includes access to  expertconsult.com . Through this online feature, the reader gains access to additional cases and images, as well as those included in the book itself. The online images have an on/off function which allows the reader to test his or her knowledge and promote recall. An online search function enables the reader to rapidly review specific cases. Most bibliographic citations include clickable links to the corresponding Medline abstract.

One potential criticism is the lack of cross-referencing to its proposed companion text, _Image-Guided Interventions_ . Readers familiar with other popular case-based review books may expect direct references to page numbers for quick cross-referencing, and none are to be found in _The Teaching Files: Interventional_ . Subsequent editions would benefit from such a feature. However, there is a full complement of references to the most important and most relevant scientific journal articles, which should provide a similar experience, if somewhat more time consuming.

Residents and fellows will appreciate its broad scope, its high-quality images, and its grounding in up-to-date scientific literature. The material likely is too advanced for most medical students to derive benefit from a case-based format during a month-long interventional radiology elective, but advanced medical students with a specific interest in interventional radiology may find this text to be a useful resource, nonetheless. Practicing radiologists may find the case-based format less efficient than a traditional text, although the interactive format makes for an engaging read.

In summary, _The Teaching Files: Interventional_ is a practical and effective resource for cased-based review of the rapidly evolving field of interventional radiology.
