One of the most significant, recent, advances in medical imaging research was the establishment in 2000 of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB). This achievement represented a culmination of decades of work by the imaging and bioengineering community.

In the late 1970s, under the leadership of Herbert Abrams from Harvard and Russell Morgan of Johns Hopkins, the Conjoint Committee on Diagnostic Radiology was formed. The mission of the Conjoint Committee was to create a greater awareness of radiology research and serve as an advocacy group for the imaging community to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Congress and other Federal Agencies. Support and sponsorship of the Conjoint Committee came from the Association of University Radiologists (AUR), Society of Chairman of Academic Radiology Departments (SCARD), the American College of Radiology (ACR) and 78 Academic Departments of Radiology. This group sponsored dozens of Grantsmanship Workshops, held National Consensus Meetings in 1984, 1988, and 1994 in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and most importantly served as the first lobbying effort by the academic radiology community. At the NIH one of the major accomplishments of the Conjoint Committee was the transfer of imaging research from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) with the understanding that the NCI would support non-cancer as well as cancer imaging research. The Conjoint Committee was successful in increasing the profile of imaging research and there was a steady increase in NIH support for imaging.

As imaging research became increasingly important in biomedical science, more imaging research was being carried out by other disease specific institutes. However research proposals that did not fit into the mission of a particular institute had a difficult time getting funded.

In 1995, the Conjoint Committee activities were folded into a new organization called the Academy of Radiology Research (ARR). The goal of this new organization was the establishment of a new Institute at the NIH dedicated to imaging research that would serve as a bridge between the physical and engineering sciences with the life sciences. If successful this would finally give imaging research a home within the NIH.

The Academy of Radiology Research was supported by broad based societies like the American College of Radiology, American Roentgen Ray Society, Association of University Radiology/Association of Program Directors in Radiology/Society of Chairman Academic Radiology Departments, Radiological Society of North America/Radiology Society of North America Research and Education Foundation and 16 subspecialty societies. In an unprecedented coming together of all of organized radiology, representing twenty three radiology societies and over 100,000 professionals, the message was clear. We needed a new NIH institute. Ed Nagy, former press secretary for Senator Sam Nunn (GA) and Chief of Staff for Congressman Valentine (NC) became the first Executive Director of the Academy. Without his knowledge and leadership it is questionable whether the Academy would have succeeded in its objective.

Despite roadblocks at the NIH for the creation of a new Institute, the leadership of the Academy, with the encouragement of its Executive Director Ed Nagy, decided that the establishment of a new institute should be the ultimate goal of the Academy and began lobbying its cause to congress. Unsuccessful bills were introduced into the House of Representatives in 1996 and in the Senate in 1997. In 1998 the Academy joined forces with American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE) and in 2000 new bills were introduced in both the House and Senate. On September 27, 2000 the House of Representatives passed a bill establishing a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and the Senate passed the companion bill on December 15,2000. On December 29, 2000, in his last official legislative act, President William Clinton signed Public Law 106-580, the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering Establishment Act and the NIBIB was established by law.

Having a home in the NIH for imaging research has made a tremendous difference and has given credibility to our entire discipline.
