This first edition of _Critical Care Radiology_ aims for interdisciplinary interpretation of adult and pediatric radiologic studiesÂ in intensive care setting. The book is a good and easy read for radiology residents taking call in general and pulmonary, body and pediatric radiology fellows in particular. The book is also very useful for the internists and intensivists who participate in critical care of patients in intensive care units around the world.

The book has seven sections, with a main emphasis on thoracic and gastrointestinal (GI) imaging. Postoperative thoracic and GI patients are covered in different sections. Separate sections are devoted to thoracic and abdominal imaging of the pediatric patients.

The thoracic section covers important everyday topics such as catheters and monitoring devices, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and pneumothorax.

The acute abdomen section covers irritable bowel disease, intestinal ischemia, GI bleed, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, acute cholecystitis, and acute pyelonephritis.

Complications of specific operations such as Whipple, biliary tract, gall bladder, and renal and colorectal surgeries are dealt with. Complications after renal or liver transplantation are described in detail.

Later sections deal with imaging of pediatric chest and abdominal intensive care.
