ACGME expectations for radiology trainees' proficiencies in communication skills pose a challenge to program directors who wish to develop curricula addressing these competencies. Numerous educational resources and pedagogical approaches have emerged to address such competencies specifically for radiology, but have yet to be systematically catalogued. In this paper, we review and compile these resources into a toolkit that will help residencies develop curricula around patient-centered communication. We describe numerous web-based resources and published models that have incorporated innovative, contemporary pedagogical techniques. In undertaking this compilation, our hope is to kindle discussion about the development of formalized or standardized communication curricula or guides for radiology residencies.

## Introduction

As originally outlined in the core competencies of the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) in the late 1990s, radiology program directors are responsible for helping their trainees meet basic expectations for proficiency in communication . With the advent of the ACGME Milestones, this communication competency has been further clarified to help assess residents' performance. The milestones now require that residents be able to communicate effectively with patients, families, and caregivers in both routine and complex conversations (Interpersonal and Communication Skills ICS2 from the ACGME Radiology Milestones) . In addition, residents must be able to convey results of imaging studies effectively with members of the health care team both during interdisciplinary conferences and through their radiology reports (Interpersonal and Communication Skills ICS1 from the ACGME Radiology Milestones) .

The ACGME expectations echo a now sizable chorus of leaders in radiology who have long beseeched the field to embrace more direct patient communication as a matter of optimal patient-centered care, in which care better incorporates patients' preferences and values, recognizes the needs of diverse communities, and ultimately leads to improved health care satisfaction and outcomes . Specific initiatives advanced by radiologic professional organizations to encourage such practices include the American College of Radiology (ACR) Commission on Patient- and Family-Centered Care (formerly the ACR Patient Experience Commission) ACR's Imaging 3.0 , the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) Radiology Cares Program , and The American Board of Radiology (ABR) Maintenance of Certification Program . These programs promote a unified vision that understands augmented patient-centered care as a major vehicle through which to achieve high value practice .

These standards challenge program directors to address communication competencies within their training curricula, and to develop both educational resources and assessment tools for their residents. Over time, numerous teaching resources and pedagogical approaches have materialized that target patient-related communication skills specifically for radiology. Currently, however, these tools are scattered independently throughout the literature, on various websites, and elsewhere. No organized catalogue of existing resources is available, which makes it difficult for training programs to incorporate and synthesize them into coherent, formalized communication curricula. A major gap thus exists in the competency expectations that have been established by the ACGME and radiology leadership, and the formalized curricular opportunities within training programs to teach this competency.

A growing trove of web-based material offers courses, vignettes, lectures, videos, case-studies, and compilations of relevant literature. Innovative pedagogical approaches have been developed that incorporate key elements of microteaching, adult education and simulation into teaching and assessing communication and interpersonal skills in radiology. More general devices such as mnemonics, scripts, and articles have also been published to assist residents with patient-related communication. Tools exist already to assess competency in communication and interpersonal skills, for example the Gap Kalamazoo Communication Assessment Tool for radiologists . This paper aims to address the gap by reviewing and compiling these resources into a toolkit that will help residencies develop curricula around patient-centered communication. With this review, we hope to kindle discussion about the development of formalized or standardized communication curricula or guides for radiology residencies.

## Web-Based Resources

The RSNA Professionalism Committee and Radiology Cares campaign, as well as the ACR Imaging 3.0 program and the Commission on Patient- and Family-Centered Care (PFCC) all house websites that collectively represent an extensive online repository of patient-centered radiology tools for radiologists . Much of these materials address patient-related communication directly.
