As academic radiologists, others define us by how we communicate. Our dictated reports and our conversations with referring physicians (and increasingly our patients) define us as clinicians. Our lectures and workstation teaching define us as educators, and our scientific presentations and scholarly writing define us as researchers. If we cannot communicate, we cannot succeed.

However, in a world increasingly infatuated with objective scores and rankings, just how do we meaningfully measure the quality of that communication? Scholarly metrics are used to decide who gets promoted and who just stagnates. They can make or break academic careers, and in this new world of value-based payments, clinical metrics can make or break paychecks. With the stakes so high, it is imperative that our efforts focus on measuring not just what _can_ be measured, but that which _should_ be measured—the things that really matter.

Our scientific journals struggle with similar metric challenges. No author sets out to write a paper for a low-ranked journal. Most investigators initially shoot high and, if rejected, shimmy their way down the journal ladder—one whose rungs are largely defined by the almighty _impact factor_ . First described by Garfield some 60 years ago, the impact factor is a measure of the frequency with which a journal's average article is cited by others . Although other algorithmic measures of journal influence exist—ones less subject to rapid fluctuations and manipulation—the impact factor is the best known, and the one on which most of us focus . In the same way that academics publish or perish, scientific journals' submissions can rise or fall based on impact factors.

In the current issue of _Academic Radiology_ , Rosenkrantz and Ayoola leverage that tried and true journal metric to assess radiology's changing scientific literature landscape. In a world in which “today's research is tomorrow's turf,” the authors news for the profession is quite good. Between 2003 and 2014, the number of indexed radiology journals increased each year by 4.6% (83 to 125), comparing favorably to the 4.2% annual growth rate for biomedical journals overall (5907 to 8718). And although the median impact factor of radiology journals grew more slowly than that for biomedical journals overall (+2.1% vs. +4.2%), radiology's median journal impact factor remains higher (1.75 vs. 1.46). In fact, biomedical journals overall now score right about where radiology journals stood over a decade ago. If the impact factor is a prognosticator of our specialty's future clinical influence, then we should all take a few moments to celebrate.
