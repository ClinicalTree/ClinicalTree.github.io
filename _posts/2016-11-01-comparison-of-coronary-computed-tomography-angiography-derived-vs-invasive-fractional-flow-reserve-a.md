## Rationale and Objectives

Invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with fractional flow reserve (FFR) assessment is the reference standard for the detection of hemodynamically relevant coronary lesions. We have investigated whether coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA)-derived FFR (fractional flow reserve from coronary computed tomographic angiography \[CT-FFR\]) measurement improves diagnostic accuracy over cCTA.

## Methods and Results

A literature search was performed for studies comparing invasive FFR, cCTA, and CT-FFR. The analysis included three prospective multicenter trials and two retrospective single-center studies; a total of 765 patients and 1306 vessels were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to invasive FFR on a per-lesion basis, CT-FFR reached a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 83.7% (95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 78.1–89.3), 74.7% (95% CI: 52.2–97.1), 64.8% (95% CI: 52.1–77.5), and 90.1% (95% CI: 80.8–99.3) compared to 84.6% (95% CI: 78.1–91.1), 49.7% (95% CI: 31.1–68.4), 39.0% (95% CI: 28.0–50.1), and 87.3% (95% CI: 72.5–100.0) for cCTA alone. In 634 vessels with intermediate stenosis (30%–70%), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 81.4% (95% CI: 70.4–92.9), 71.7% (95% CI: 54.5–89.0), 59.4% (95% CI: 35.5–83.4), and 89.9% (95% CI: 85.0–94.7) compared to 90.2% (95% CI: 80.6–99.9), 35.4% (95% CI: 23.5–47.3), 50.7% (95% CI: 30.6–70.8), and 82.5% (95% CI: 64.5–100.0) for cCTA alone. The summary area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CT-FFR was superior to cCTA alone on a per-vessel (0.90 \[95% CI: 0.82–0.98\] vs 0.74 \[95% CI: 0.63–0.86\]; _P_ = .0047) and for intermediate stenoses (0.76 \[95% CI: 0.65–0.88\] vs 0.57 \[95% CI: 0.49–0.66\]; _P_ = .0027).

## Conclusion

CT-FFR significantly improves specificity without noticeably altering the sensitivity of cCTA with invasive FFR as a reference standard for the detection of hemodynamically relevant stenosis.

## Introduction

Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is an established noninvasive method for the exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in low to intermediate risk patient populations . Although it tends to overestimate lesion severity compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA), cCTA allows for the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery anatomy. However, the hemodynamic significance of coronary stenoses cannot be sufficiently evaluated with cCTA alone . Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an invasive technique performed during cardiac catheterization that evaluates the functional significance of indeterminate coronary stenoses and provides guidance for lesion-specific revascularization therapy .

At this time, three large prospective clinical trials have demonstrated the diagnostic value of a noninvasive FFR (fractional flow reserve from coronary computed tomographic angiography \[CT-FFR\]) algorithm (HeartFlow, Inc., Redwood City, CA) based on fluid-dynamic modeling of coronary flow using diagnostic cCTA data acquired at rest . Furthermore, an initial study presented results on the diagnostic performance of an alternative on-site algorithm (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany), also based on fluid-dynamic modeling; these results were subsequently corroborated by a larger study . Taken together, these investigations have demonstrated that algorithm-based noninvasive FFR derivation from cCTA compares favorably to the diagnostic gold standard of invasive FFR.

## Methods

## Study Design and Search Criteria

The present study was conducted in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement to establish standards to ensure the quality of meta-analyses . We performed a literature search on the Science Citation Index, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases until June 2015 using the following keywords: CT-based FFR, FFR CT, noninvasive FFR, noninvasive fractional flow reserve, non-invasive FFR, and non-invasive fractional flow reserve. Studies meeting the following inclusion criteria comprised the final meta-analysis: study design involving diagnostic accuracy assessment, age of all study subjects ≥18 years, subject presentation with suspected or known CAD, CT-FFR as the index test, invasive FFR as the diagnostic reference standard, CT-FFR and invasive FFR in at least 50 patients. Duplicate studies were excluded. The study selection process is diagrammed in  Figure 1 .
