_Breast Imaging_ is now in its revised, updated third edition. This beautifully illustrated book comprehensively reviews all modalities and aspects of breast imaging. The intended audience includes radiology residents and fellows, practicing radiologists, and breast imagers. The author, Dr. Daniel Kopans, is director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, an esteemed leader in the field of breast imaging, and author of several hundred peer-reviewed articles.

The text is well organized and written with an energetic, conversational style. The first half of the book is devoted to setting the stage for image interpretation. Breast anatomy, histology, physiology, and pathology are covered in the initial chapters. The updated pathology overview is succinct and contains numerous excellent photomicrographs and diagrams. The subsequent chapters contain in-depth discussions of epidemiology and efficacy of mammographic screening. Kopans addresses the most recent controversy involving efficacy of breast cancer screening and provides a rigorous discussion of the data and summary recommendations. The discussion of the current issues surrounding the detection of ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma in situ, and early-stage breast cancer have been updated and revised.

The remainder of the book covers image interpretation, pathologic correlation, breast interventions, medical legal issues, and reporting. A dedicated chapter discusses the “Systematic Approach to Breast Imaging,” and chapters on the normal breast, mammography interpretation, benign lesions, and suspicious lesions have also been updated. The breast ultrasound chapter includes a section on appropriate usage as well as numerous images with pathologic correlation. Significant revisions address advances in breast imaging including digital mammography and magnetic resonance imaging. Additional commentary is provided on the evolution of the Breast Imaging Report and a separate section has been written on the preliminary results regarding digital breast tomosynthesis.

In a style similar to previous editions, the evidence-based literature is presented systematically, building the case for breast cancer screening and the appropriateness criteria for diagnostic workup. The historical trials supporting breast cancer screening are recounted with fascinating historical detail and are well worth the read. Shortcomings in the research data are fully discussed and Kopans continually urges the reader to evaluate all evidence independently, especially as new clinical trials are published. Where the data fail to answer clinical questions in the field, he unabashedly makes recommendations based on almost 30 years of experience.

The preface does not apologize for redundancy throughout the text. Each chapter is purposefully designed to stand alone and present similar material from multiple perspectives. Kopans is highly successful in delivering complex material in an understandable systematic way, yet maintains reader interest with an engaging tone and style. These qualities enhance the utility of the text as both a reference and general review. The third edition will prove invaluable to the resident on clinical rotation, the general radiologist, and those seeking an in depth discussion of the current field and history of breast imaging. Although Dr. Kopans asserts the text is by no means comprehensive, the majority of readers will be impressed with the both the depth and scope of _Breast Imaging_ , which assimilates the published experience from many institutions over nearly four decades of clinical and scientific investigation.
