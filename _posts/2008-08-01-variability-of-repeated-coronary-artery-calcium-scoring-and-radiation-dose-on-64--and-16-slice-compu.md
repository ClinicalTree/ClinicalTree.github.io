## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to compare coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores, the variability and radiation doses on 64- and 16-slice computed tomography (CT) scanners by both prospective electrocardiographically (ECG)-triggered and retrospective ECG-gated scans.

## Materials and Methods

Coronary artery models ( _n_ = 3) with different plaque CT densities (∼240 Hounsfield units \[HU\], ∼600 HU, and ∼1000 HU) of four sizes (1, 3, 5, and 10 mm in length) on a cardiac phantom were scanned three times in five heart rate sequences. The tube current-time products were set to almost the same on all four protocols (32.7 mAs for 64-slice prospective and retrospective scans, 33.3 mAs for 16-slice prospective and retrospective scans). Slice thickness was set to 2.5 mm to keep the radiation dose low. Overlapping reconstruction with a 1.25-mm increment was applied on the retrospective ECG-gated scan.

## Results

The CAC scores were not different between the four protocols (one-factor analysis of variance: Agatston, _P_ = .32; volume, _P_ = .19; and mass, _P_ = .09). Two-factor factorial analysis of variance test revealed that the interscan variability was different between protocols ( _P_ < .01) and scoring algorithms ( _P_ < .01). The average variability of Agatston/volume/mass scoring and effective doses were as follows: 64-slice prospective scan: 16%/15%/11% and 0.5 mSv; 64-slice retrospective scan: 11%/11%/8% and 3.7 mSv; 16-slice prospective scan: 20%/18%/13% and 0.6 mSv; and 16-slice retrospective scan: 16%/15%/11% and 2.9 to 3.5 mSv (depending on the pitch).

## Conclusion

Retrospective ECG-gated 64-slice CT showed the lowest variability. Prospective ECG-triggered 64-slice CT, with low radiation dose, shows low variability on CAC scoring comparable to retrospective ECG-gated 16-slice CT.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring is performed to evaluate the presence of coronary atherosclerosis or to assess the progression and regression of coronary atherosclerosis ( ). Therefore, low variability and low radiation exposure are both key requirements on CAC scoring. Interscan variability of Agatston score ( ) on electron beam computed tomography (CT), however, yielding 20% to 37% ( ), is high, considering that normal progression of CAC scores per year is 14% to 27% (average 24%) ( ) and is accelerated up to 33% to 48% with significant coronary disease ( ). To reduce the variability, the volumetric approach ( ) and the calcium mass ( ) were devised as alternative CAC scoring algorithms. Also, on multidetector CT (MDCT), CAC scoring using the conventional Agatston method on nonoverlapping reconstruction yields high interscan variability: 23% to 43% ( ) on 4-slice spiral CT and 22% ( ) on 16-slice CT. Through retrospective electrocardiographically (ECG)-gated overlapping scan, a considerable reduction in interscan variability of Agatston scores can be achieved: 23% to 12% ( ) and 22% to 13% ( ), but at the expense of increased radiation exposure compared with ECG-triggered scan. Thin-slice images (1.25 or 1.5 mm) are shown to also reduce variability of CAC in both electron beam CT ( ) and 64-slice CT ( ). It does, however, require an increased radiation dose to maintain required image quality. In these circumstances, CAC scoring is preferably performed with a standard image thickness (2.5 or 3 mm), offering the best balance of low scoring variability and low radiation dose. The purpose of this study is, using a pulsating cardiac phantom, to assess the variability of CAC scoring on 64- and 16-slice CT scanners by both prospective ECG-triggered and retrospective ECG-gated scans.

## Materials and methods

## Cardiac Phantom

A prototype cardiac phantom is commercially available (ALPHA 2; Fuyo Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The phantom consists of five components: driver, control, support, rubber balloon, and electrocardiograph. A controller with an electrocardiographic synchronizer drives the balloon. The main characteristics of this phantom are programmable variable heart rate sequences and mimicking of natural heart movements. Details of the phantom are described elsewhere ( ).

![Figure 2, Cardiac balloon phantom. A pulsating phantom is shown with three coronary artery models, indicated with arrows ( a ). The coronary artery models with different computed tomographic densities were attached to a balloon filled with a mixture of water and contrast medium (45 Hounsfield units [HU]) to simulate noncontrast blood. The balloon was submerged in corn oil (−112 HU), simulating epicardial and pericardial fat ( b ). The drawing shows four coronary artery calcium models (1, 3, 5, and 10 mm in length), resulting in 75% area stenosis, inserted into a coronary artery model with a diameter of 4 mm ( c ).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/VariabilityofRepeatedCoronaryArteryCalciumScoringandRadiationDoseon64and16SliceComputedTomographybyProspectiveElectrocardiographicallytriggeredAxialandRetrospectiveElectrocardiographicallygatedSpiralComputedTomography/1_1s20S1076633208001840.jpg)

The calcium phantom was scanned on the four protocols to enable calibration for determining calcium mass. All CT scans were scored by one radiologist with eight years experience of CAC measurement. Interobserver variability was not investigated as CAC scoring in this phantom study was very simple.
