## Rationale and Objectives

Studies of radiologic error reveal high levels of variation between radiologists. Although it is known that experts outperform novices, we have only limited knowledge about radiologic expertise and how it is acquired.

## Materials and Methods

This review identifies three areas of research: studies of the impact of experience and related factors on the accuracy of decision-making; studies of the organization of expert knowledge; and studies of radiologists’ perceptual processes.

## Results and Conclusion

Interpreting evidence from these three paradigms in the light of recent research into perceptual learning and studies of the visual pathway has a number of conclusions for the training of radiologists, particularly for the design of computer-based learning programs that are able to illustrate the similarities and differences between diagnoses, to give access to large numbers of cases and to help identify weaknesses in the way trainees build up a global representation from fixated regions.

In 1999, the Institute of Medicine’s Committee on Quality of Health Care in America produced the report “To Err is Human,” which contained the headline-grabbing statistic that as many as 98,000 Americans might be dying each year as a result of medical error ( ). The report was highly influential and led professional organizations and government agencies, not just in the United States, to pay increased attention to the problem of medical error and the concept of patient safety.

Most studies of error in radiology report significant rates of “observer variability” or disagreement with a gold standard. A review by Goddard et al suggests a range of 2%–20% for clinically significant or major error across radiologic investigations ( ). More recently, van Rijn et al compared spiral computed tomography (CT) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a series of patients suspected of lumbar herniated discs and found only moderate levels of agreement between observers, who, for example, disagreed on herniation at CT evaluation in 12% of discs ( ). Halligan et al asked experts, consultants, and experienced trainees to report a consecutive series of 20 double-contrast barium enema studies ( ). They found that experts misclassified 23% of cases, whereas consultants misclassified 31% and trainees 34%. Manning et al report a missed lesion rate of 27.2% in a study involving four radiologists viewing 120 chest x-rays, containing 81 lung nodules ( ). Monnier-Cholley carried out a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study of lung cancer detection from a selected set of chest x-rays and noted that overall consistency in observer detection of lung nodules was poor (the LROC A  z being 0.54 ± 0.024 for residents, 0.561 ± 0.033 for staff radiologists) ( ). These findings should be considered in the light of others suggesting that clinically insignificant errors predominate over significant ones and that audits of large numbers routine cases reveal lower error rates than laboratory studies based on selected cases ( ).

Many possible solutions to the problem have been proposed, including the use of computer aids, multiple human readers, and improvements in working conditions ( ). The evidence about the effectiveness of computer aids is increasingly negative ( ), constraints on manpower limit the scope for double reading, whereas there is such variety in working conditions that general suggestions for improvement are not helpful. Another key variable which needs to be addressed is that of radiologist skill or expertise. We know that some radiologists are better than others, and that experts do better than novices. But what do we know about the nature of this difference? And does what we know help us to understand how training can best enhance radiologists’ abilities? In the rest of this article, I first review the research into radiologic expertise and then summarize some more general findings about perception and experience. In the conclusion, the reviewed research on expertise is interpreted in the light of the more general work in order to furnish some conclusions for radiologic training.

## Understanding the nature of perceptual learning

![Figure 3, The reverse hierarchy theory of perceptual learning. The processing of visual information moves through a hierarchy of levels, with lower levels being responsible for detecting simple image features such as lines or edges, and higher levels performing the recognition or classification of objects. If perceptual learning resulted from changes in the processing of low-level features we would expect the learning to be specific to the low-level features of the stimulus (such as contrast or orientation). Such low-level learning seems to occur, but only after higher level learning has taken place and only if task demands are high (for example, if the images are noisy).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AReviewofResearchIntotheDevelopmentofRadiologicExpertiseImplicationsforComputerBasedTraining/2_1s20S107663320700339X.jpg)

![Figure 4, This diagram shows how innovative presentation can help teach classification. The tool displays a two dimensional projections of a conceptual space, created by charaterising cases along different axes. This can help trainees to get a sense of how instances of a disease are distributed around a typical case. The distance between a case of unknown diagnosis and the typical presentations of candidate diagnoses can be used to help in classification.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/AReviewofResearchIntotheDevelopmentofRadiologicExpertiseImplicationsforComputerBasedTraining/3_1s20S107663320700339X.jpg)
