## Rationale and Objectives

The clinimetric properties of blood oxygen level‒dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of musculoskeletal changes have been poorly investigated. The study objectives were to assess the interframework reliability of data acquisition of BOLD MRI and to test its convergent validity in chronic arthritis in a rabbit model of inflammatory arthritis as compared with corresponding clinical and laboratory measures.

## Materials and Methods

One of the knees of 12 New Zealand male white rabbits was injected with a 1% carrageenin solution, and the contralateral (control) one was not. Twelve rabbits were euthanized on day 28 of arthritis (chronic arthritis). Clinical (joint diameters), laboratory (serum amyloid A concentration), and BOLD MRI measurements were obtained on days 0, 1, and 28 of arthritis. Twenty paradigms of data acquisition and analysis were applied.

## Results

The most reliable MRI parameters set, regardless of threshold values used for data analysis, was spiral technique (level 1), 40 ms of echo time (level 2), 60 seconds of on\_ and off\_ paradigm (level 3) and carbogen mixture of gases (95% O2 + 5% CO2) (level 4). With regard to construct validity, BOLD imaging correlated moderately ( _r_ = −.54, _P_ < .0001) with knee diameters, and weakly ( _r_ = −.35, _P_ = .01) with laboratory indices (high threshold for analysis).

## Conclusion

BOLD MRI has a substantial or excellent interframework reliability for assessment of arthritic rabbit knees; however, it correlates only moderately or poorly with clinical and laboratory measures. Nevertheless, this study supports further validation of BOLD MRI for assessment of soft tissue changes in a rabbit model of arthritis.

The clinical diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is defined by a constellation of clinical signs present during the first 6 months of illness . However, at this point no single clinical and laboratory marker is able to accurately detect the disease and predict an unfavorable outcome (severe cartilage degeneration leading to functional handicap) early on during the course of the disease.

Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive method that is dependent on changes in deoxyhemoglobin concentrations which in turn are inversely proportional to changes in local blood flow . This technique therefore holds promise for being used as a surrogate indicator of changes in tissue blood flow such as for increase in perisynovial tissue perfusion as a compensatory effect for hypoxia in early disease. In cases of responsive hypoxic tissues, the use of BOLD MRI allows measurement of the local vascular reactivity.
