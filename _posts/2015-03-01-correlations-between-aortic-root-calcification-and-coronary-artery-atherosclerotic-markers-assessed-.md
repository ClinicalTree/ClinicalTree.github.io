## Rationale and Objectives

Atherosclerosis is a systemic process associated with arterial calcification in multiple vascular beds. This study investigated correlations between aortic root calcification (ARC) quantified using Agatston and volumetric scoring methods with coronary atherosclerotic markers (coronary artery calcification \[CAC\], calcified plaques, and luminal stenosis).

## Materials and Methods

This cross-sectional study was carried out between January and December 2013. One hundred ninety-six consecutive patients with intermediate pretest probability of ischemic heart disease who underwent 64-slice multidetector computed tomography angiography were recruited, with 175 patients being eligible to enroll in the study.

## Results

A significant correlation was observed between ARC and total CAC using the Agatston and volumetric scoring methods (r = 0.225; _P_ = .003 and r = 0.243; _P_ = .001, respectively). With regard to individual coronary vessel calcification and ARC, a significant correlation was observed between ARC and left main stem artery calcification calculated using the volumetric and Agatston scoring methods _(P <_ .05). A significant correlation was observed between high ARC and presence of coronary calcified plaque measured using the Agatston and volumetric scoring methods. A strong correlation was also observed between ARC and number of coronary stenotic vessels measured using the Agatston and volumetric scoring methods (r = 0.67; _P_ < .001 and r = 0.63; _P_ < .001, respectively).

## Conclusions

ARC can be used as an additional marker to assess coronary atherosclerosis and may have a complementary role with CAC for detection of coronary artery disease.

Recently, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has become the preferred imaging tool for coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic root morphology assessment before aortic valve replacement because of its high temporal and spatial resolution and its reportedly high reproducibility . Various methods and scores have been used to measure arterial calcification by MDCT including Agatston, volume, and mass scores, with significant variability between theses scoring methods in terms of reproducibility and interscan agreement .

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) assessed by MDCT has incremental prognostic values beyond those of traditional cardiac risk factors and scores for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality reported in several large follow-up studies, and it may help in reclassification of patients at increased risk .
