## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively compare resident adherence to checklist-style structured reporting for maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) from the emergency department (when required vs. suggested between two programs). To compare radiology resident reporting accuracy before and after introduction of the structured report and assess its ability to decrease the rate of undetected pathology.

## Materials and Methods

We introduced a reporting checklist for maxillofacial CT into our dictation software without specific training, requiring it at one program and suggesting it at another. We quantified usage among residents and compared reporting accuracy, before and after counting and categorizing faculty addenda.

## Results

There was no significant change in resident accuracy in the first few months, with residents acting as their own controls (directly comparing performance with and without the checklist). Adherence to the checklist at program A (where it originated and was required) was 85% of reports compared to 9% of reports at program B (where it was suggested). When using program B as a secondary control, there was no significant difference in resident accuracy with or without using the checklist (comparing different residents using the checklist to those not using the checklist).

## Conclusions

Our results suggest that there is no automatic value of checklists for improving radiology resident reporting accuracy. They also suggest the importance of focused training, checklist flexibility, and a period of adjustment to a new reporting style. Mandatory checklists were readily adopted by residents but not when simply suggested.

Standardized radiology reporting aims to improve patient safety and accuracy by providing a clear and thorough template. The growing emphasis on structured reporting in the radiology community , which is internationally recognized , borrows from work in many areas . Universal protocols and checklists are taking hold throughout medicine: for bedside procedures, in the operating room, and for infection control in hospital units . The use of checklists has been found to decrease catheter-related septicemia by more than five-fold , surgical hospitalization complications by more than one-third to one-half , and overall anesthesia-related mortality . Such checklists, inspired by safety measures enacted in the airline industry, have been advocated for radiology reporting . Specific areas of radiology have benefited from efforts at standardizing terminology, recommendations and reporting, such as through the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems, the developing Liver Imaging Reporting and Data Systems, and the Fleischner Society guidelines for pulmonary nodules . Similarly, there are ongoing efforts to standardize reporting language, for instance the RadLex database .

Although there is increasing evidence that radiologists and referrers prefer structured reporting , universal reporting standards are in variable states of maturity in the field of radiology, and the inconsistency of reporting style and language remains a concern. One study found 14 terms used to describe the same entity on chest radiographs . The clarity of reports is paramount in providing valuable information and ensuring safety .
