## Rationale and Objectives

Evidence is inconsistent about whether radiologists' interpretive performance on a screening mammography test set reflects their performance in clinical practice. This study aimed to estimate the correlation between test set and clinical performance and determine if the correlation is influenced by cancer prevalence or lesion difficulty in the test set.

## Materials and Methods

This institutional review board-approved study randomized 83 radiologists from six Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium registries to assess one of four test sets of 109 screening mammograms each; 48 radiologists completed a fifth test set of 110 mammograms 2 years later. Test sets differed in number of cancer cases and difficulty of lesion detection. Test set sensitivity and specificity were estimated using woman-level and breast-level recall with cancer status and expert opinion as gold standards. Clinical performance was estimated using women-level recall with cancer status as the gold standard. Spearman rank correlations between test set and clinical performance with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.

## Results

For test sets with fewer cancers ( _N_ = 15) that were more difficult to detect, correlations were weak to moderate for sensitivity (woman level = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.16, 0.69; breast level = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.61) and weak for specificity (0.24, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.45) relative to expert recall. Correlations for test sets with more cancers ( _N_ = 30) were close to 0 and not statistically significant.

## Conclusions

Correlations between screening performance on a test set and performance in clinical practice are not strong. Test set performance more accurately reflects performance in clinical practice if cancer prevalence is low and lesions are challenging to detect.

## Introduction

The interpretive performance of screening mammography varies extensively among US radiologists . Given US radiologists have relatively low interpretive volume, on average , and often do not work up their own recalled cases , they have limited opportunities to know, directly or indirectly, whether women they recalled or did not recall on screening mammograms experienced benign or malignant outcomes. A test set of selected mammography images could be an efficient method to assess radiologists' skill level and to identify potential opportunities for improvement. Additionally, test sets could help radiologists meet Part 2 of the American Board of Radiology's Maintenance of Certification requirements (Lifelong Learning and Self-Assessment) .

Findings from prior studies are inconsistent about whether interpretive performance on screening mammography test sets is correlated with performance in clinical practice, possibly due to small samples (of radiologists or images) and variability in test set composition, performance measures evaluated, and statistical approaches used . In a study of 27 US radiologists who interpreted a test set of 113 film screening mammography examinations (30 with cancer), Rutter and Taplin found moderate correlation between the specificity of screening mammography interpreted in clinical and test settings (0.41; 95% Bayesian credible interval: 0.16, 0.62), but no evidence of correlation between clinical and test set sensitivity (−0.18, 95% Bayesian credible interval: −0.27, 0.59). In contrast, Soh et al. found significant, moderate correlations of 0.30–0.57 between several clinical audit measures and two test set measures (location sensitivity and jackknifing free-response operating characteristic figure-of-merit) of 60 cases (20 with cancer) read by 20 radiologists, but no correlation with test set specificity. Similarly, Scott et al. found significant, moderate correlations of 0.29–0.41 between several performance measures on the PERFORMs test set and clinical performance among 39 readers in the UK. None of these prior studies evaluated the influence of breast cancer prevalence or lesion difficulty on the strength of the correlations.
