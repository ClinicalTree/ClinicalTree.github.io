## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to investigate the association between 8-week tumor volume decrease and survival in an independent cohort of _epidermal growth factor receptor_ ( _EGFR_ )-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with first-line erlotinib or gefitinib, and to assess the rate of their volumetric tumor growth after the volume nadir.

## Materials and Methods

In patients with advanced NSCLC harboring sensitizing _EGFR_ mutations treated with first-line erlotinib or gefitinib, computed tomography (CT) tumor volumes of dominant lung lesions were analyzed for (1) the association with survival, and (2) the volumetric tumor growth rate after the volume nadir.

## Results

In 44 patients with the 8-week follow-up CT, the 8-week tumor volume decrease (%) was significantly associated with longer overall survival when fitted as a continuous variable in a Cox model ( _P_ = 0.01). The growth rate of the logarithm of tumor volume (log  e V), obtained using a linear mixed-effects model adjusting for time since baseline, was 0.096/month (SE: 0.013/month; 95% confidence interval \[CI\]: 0.071–0.12/month), which was similar to the rate of 0.12/month (SE: 0.015/month; 95%CI: 0.090–0.15/month) observed in the previous report.

## Conclusions

The 8-week tumor volume decrease was validated as a marker for longer survival in the independent cohort of _EGFR_ -mutant NSCLC patients treated with first-line erlotinib or gefitinib. The volumetric tumor growth rate after the nadir in this cohort was similar to that of the previous cohort, indicating the reproducibility of the observation among different patient cohorts.

## Introduction

The discoveries of genomic abnormalities in the tumors from patients with lung cancer and the effective treatment with targeted agents have ushered in a new era of therapeutic approaches to lung cancer . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( _EGFR_ ) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been studied as one of the major therapeutic targets since their discovery in 2004 . Patients with NSCLC harboring sensitizing _EGFR_ mutations have initial dramatic responses to the _EGFR_ tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib, gefitinib, and afatinib, with response rates of 55–83% and progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.7–13.1 months . However, their tumors eventually grow back during _EGFR_ -TKI therapy due to the development of acquired resistance, eventually leading to tumor progression . The duration of disease control from _EGFR_ -TKI therapy can range from 4 months to 4 years or longer . In this context, objective early markers of tumor response during _EGFR_ -TKI therapy are needed to identify patients who can safely remain on therapy and those who are unlikely to have long-term control and may potentially benefit from an early introduction of additional or alternative agents.

Imaging remains as the principal method to objectively characterize the tumor burden during cancer therapy . Prior studies have demonstrated the limitations of the conventional diameter-based approach according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and indicated the need for volumetric tumor assessment . The previous studies evaluated tumor volume measurements in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with _EGFR_ -TKIs using Food and Drug Administration-approved, commercially available software and published the high reproducibility of the technique . By applying this technique to patients with _EGFR_ -mutant NSCLC treated with the first-line erlotinib or gefitinib, the study demonstrated that greater tumor volume decrease at 8 weeks of therapy is significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS), with a cut-off value of 38% volume decrease at 8 weeks best differentiating patients with longer OS and PFS . The 8-week volume change as a predictor of survival has a potential role in identifying patients who may benefit from additional or alternative therapy in the early course of therapy, and help in maximizing the benefit of targeted therapy and in improving the clinical outcome. Tumor volume analysis was also applied to characterize the rate of tumor growth in patients with _EGFR_ -mutant NSCLC after they reach their volume nadir (the smallest tumor volume since baseline), which is another important aspect in assessing benefit of cancer therapy . A prior study reported a reference value of the volumetric tumor growth rate among these patients after their volume nadir, which helps to differentiate slow versus fast progressors among those who are on _EGFR_ -TKI therapy, thus contributing to provide an objective guidance about when to keep patients on the _EGFR_ -TKI after progression .
