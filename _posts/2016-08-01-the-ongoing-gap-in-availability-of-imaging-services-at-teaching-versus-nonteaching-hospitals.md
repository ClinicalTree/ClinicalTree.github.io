## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to characterize associations between availability of imaging services and intensity of teaching among US hospitals.

## Materials and Methods

Using the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database, we studied information regarding the availability of imaging services at general hospitals nationwide in 2007 (4102 hospitals) and in 2012 (3876). Teaching intensity was categorized as Council of Teaching Hospitals (COTH) member, non-COTH teaching hospital (non-COTH member with affiliated medical school and/or residency), and nonteaching hospital. Availability in hospitals of reported basic and advanced imaging modalities, as well as beds, number of employed physicians, and case mix index, was analyzed. Univariable and multivariable trends were assessed.

## Results

All 15 assessed modalities showed significant increases in availability with increasing hospital teaching intensity ( _P_ < 0.001). Modalities showing the largest differences between COTH and nonteaching hospitals in 2012 were image-guided radiation therapy (78% vs. 14%), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (74% vs. 17%), and single-photon emission computed tomography (88% vs. 35%). The gap between COTH and nonteaching hospitals increased from 43% in 2007 to 57% in 2012 for positron emission tomography/computed tomography, and from 34% to 48% for virtual colonoscopy. COTH status was a significant predictor, independent of beds and employed physicians, for 10 modalities ( _P_ < 0.001–0.038). Greater case mix index was significantly associated with availability of advanced, although not basic, modalities.

## Conclusions

Availability of imaging services increased with greater hospital teaching intensity. Differences were most pronounced and sustained over time for advanced modalities. Our findings reflect the greater advanced imaging resources necessary to support the complexity of care rendered at teaching hospitals. This differential must be considered when exploring adjustments to teaching hospitals' funding levels.

## Introduction

Robust graduate medical education (GME) is vital in ensuring a future supply of well-trained physicians. However, GME is a costly process. Training programs entail considerable direct costs, such as the salaries and benefits of residents and their supervising faculty, as well as the administrative and overhead costs of operating an accredited training program. In addition, teaching hospitals face greater costs relating to offering more advanced and specialized services, as well as caring for a greater fraction of sicker, more complex, and uninsured patients .

GME is largely funded by the Medicare program , which provides teaching hospitals with both a direct GME payment to cover teaching costs as well as an indirect medical education (IME) payment to cover teaching hospitals' greater overall cost of patient care . Concerns regarding the solvency of the Medicare program have driven continual efforts to curtail Medicare's GME funding . For instance, the Balanced Budget Act in 1997 capped the number of nationally funded GME positions and substantially reduced the IME add-on percentage . MedPAC, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the Congressional Budget Office, as well as several recent annual White House budgets have all called for further large reductions in Medicare's GME funding, typically targeting IME payments . Some policymakers have even suggested that Medicare cease funding GME altogether .
