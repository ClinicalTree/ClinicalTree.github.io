## Rationale and Objectives

Cardiac computer tomography (CT) image-based vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) assessment and the influence of cardiovascular disease risk factors on BMD have not been systematically evaluated, especially in a community-based, multiethnic population.

## Methods

A cross-sectional study design is used to determine if cardiac CT image is a reliable source to assess vertebral BMD, and a total of 2028 CT images were obtained from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large, diverse US cohort of adults 45 to 84 years of age.

## Results

Cardiac CT image allows the rapid assessment of vertebral BMD and related fractures. The mean BMD was significantly higher in men compared with women for thoracic vertebrae (143.2 ± 41.2 vs 138.7 ± 42.7 mg/cm³, respectively, _P_ = .014), as well as for lumbar vertebrae (125.0 ± 37.9 vs 117.2 ± 39.4 mg/cm³, respectively, _P_ < .0001). Thoracic and lumbar BMDs are closely correlated (correlation coefficient 0.87, _P_ < .001), independent of age and other confounders including sex and race. African American men had the highest thoracic BMD among all race/ethnicity and sex subgroups. Prevalence of fractures in total vertebrae is 4.2%. Lumbar had approximately 2 times higher prevalence of fracture than thoracic, and the prevalence of vertebral fractures is 1.5% and 3.1% for thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, respectively.

## Conclusions

Using cardiac CT images to garner and assess vertebral BMD is a feasible and reliable method. Cardiac CT has the additional advantages of evaluate vertebral bone health while assessing cardiovascular disease risk with no extra cost or radiation exposure.

Cardiac computed tomography (CT), especially the latest-generation multidetector CT, is a noninvasive imaging tool that has been increasingly applied for early atherosclerosis detection, quantification of coronary artery calcification, and coronary artery stenosis assessment . Some initial studies have indicated that cardiac CT may have the potential to assess vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) while assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with no extra cost or radiation , but the results show population diversity. Method validation is extremely important, especially in a community-based, multiethnic (white, African American, Asian, and Hispanic) population.

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a population-based study of eight large sex/ethnic subpopulations with cardiac CT scanning images across the United States. This study provides an opportunity to evaluate vertebral BMD based on noncontrast cardiac CT images. Compared with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the predominant screening tool for BMD, cardiac CT has at least three unique advantages: (a) ability to clearly separate cortical and trabecular bone; (b) offer “real” volumetric density in units of mg/cm³; and (c) provide high-resolution three-dimensional images of bone morphometry. Notably, compared with cortical bone, trabecular bone loses first and quick response to medical therapies as well. So trabecular bone may offer a more realistic reflection of bone mineral metabolism and bone density status . In this study, we use cardiac CT image to garner vertebral bone information and then to assess trabecular BMD (tBMD) and related fractures while assessing cardiovascular disease risk.
