## Rationale and Objectives

We used rabbits to investigate the possibility of differentiating between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fatty liver (FL) on scans acquired by open-type‒ and gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)‒enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Materials and Methods

We divided 15 adult rabbits into three equal groups; they received standard (control group), high-fat (FL) content (FL group), or choline-deficient chow (NASH group). With the animals under general anesthesia we acquired scans on an open 0.3-Tesla MRI system. Signal intensity (SI) was measured before and after contrast administration and defined as SI-pre and SI-post, respectively. Relative SI enhancement (Sr) was calculated using the equation: Sr = (average of three SI-post- minus average of three SI values in no-signal fields)/(average of three SI-pre- minus average of three SI values in no-signal fields) × 100. Maximum Sr (Srmax), the time (in seconds) required to reach Srmax (Tmax), and the difference between Srmax and Sr at 30 minutes (Sr  30m R) were analyzed.

## Results

Srmax was significantly higher in the NASH rabbits than the other two groups ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusions

In rabbits, the Srmax value made it possible to differentiate NASH from normal and fatty liver.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was first named by Ludwig et al to describe biopsy findings in patients with no history of significant alcohol consumption . In autopsy studies performed in the United States, approximately 20% of liver specimens revealed hepatic steatosis and about 3% manifested NASH. NASH has also been reported in children . Approximately 1% of hepatic steatosis advances to NASH and 40% of NASH is considered fibrotic; 3%–10% of cases advance to liver cirrhosis . Therefore, early detection and treatment are important . At present, there are no biochemical diagnostic tests for NASH and biochemical studies may return normal results even in patients with serious liver disease. An unequivocal clinical diagnosis requires liver biopsy .

Criteria for the evaluation of hepatic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans have not been established . In their rat experiments, Tsuda et al used a 1.5 Tesla MRI scanner and gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA), a hepatobiliary contrast agent in rats, to differentiate between NASH and fatty liver (FL). Because different species and MRI scans acquired at different field strengths may affect the results, we subjected rabbits with NASH induced by a choline-deficient diet, rabbits with FL induced by a high-fat diet, and rabbits fed a standard diet to open-type MRI scanning.
