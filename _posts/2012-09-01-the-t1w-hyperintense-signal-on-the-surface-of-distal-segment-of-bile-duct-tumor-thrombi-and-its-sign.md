## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate the magnetic resonance (MR) findings of bile duct tumor thrombi (BDTT) and intraductal growing-type cholangiocarcinoma (IDG-type CC), especially focusing on the distal segment of intrabiliary tumors.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine cases of hepatocellular carcinoma with BDTT and 17 cases of IDG-type CC were available for retrospective review. The following MR findings were evaluated: presence of necrosis and T1-weighted (T1W) hyperintense signal on the surface of the distal segment of intrabiliary tumors, bile duct wall thickening adjacent to the tumor, dilation of bile duct of the tumor-bearing segment, location and maximum diameter of intraductal mass, and presence of a hepatic parenchymal mass.

## Results

There was significant difference in T1W hyperintense signal on the surface of the distal segment of intrabiliary tumors between BDTT and IDG-type CC ( _P_ < .05). The T1W hyperintense signal detected in BDTT was identified as bile layering (9/25) or hemobilia (16/25) pathologically. For the diagnosis of BDTT, the sensitivity and specificity of T1W hyperintense signal was 86.2% and 100%, respectively. There was significant difference in necrosis at the distal end of intrabiliary tumors and presence of hepatic parenchymal mass between BDTT and IDG-type CC ( _P_ < .05). However, no statistical significance was found in bile duct dilation, the absence of wall thickening, the location of intraductal mass, or the maximum diameter of intrabiliary mass between the two groups ( _P_ \> .05).

## Conclusions

The T1W hyperintense signal on the distal segment of intrabiliary mass was because of concentrated bile deposits or hemobilia. The sign of T1W hyper signal on the distal segment is valuable to differentiate BDTT and IDG-type CC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common types of malignant abdominal tumors. Jaundice is common in HCC and the incidence is approximately 19% to 40% . The etiology of jaundice is primarily from diffuse tumor infiltration of the liver parenchyma, hilar invasion accompanied by compression of the bile duct, or progressive terminal liver failure . HCC can invade the bile duct and form intrabiliary tumor thrombi . Patients with this type of HCC normally have obstructive jaundice as their initial complaint. Bile duct tumor thrombi (BDTT) formation is presented in 0.8% to 12.9% of surgically resected HCC . Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a commonly used diagnostic imaging modality for the detection of hepatic and biliary tumors. The MR manifestation of HCC with BDTT has been reported in the literature . BDTT presents as an intrabiliary cordlike or castlike soft-tissue mass with dilated distal bile duct. However, bile duct wall thickening or tumor invasion beyond bile duct wall is not accompanied in most of the BDTT . On the dynamic-enhanced MR images, early enhancement of BDTT can be detected in the arterial phase . These MR features are very similar to those of intraductal growing-type cholangiocarcinoma (IDG-type CC), which also known as early bile duct carcinoma . These two entities (BDTT and IDG-type CC) are distinct in terms of treatment strategies and prognosis. The prognosis of patients with BDTT is generally poor even with aggressive operative approach, whereas good surgical outcomes can be obtained in IDG-type CC patients after complete resection . For an intrabiliary mass with small hepatic tumor or undetectable liver parenchyma tumor, special emphasis should be placed on discriminating BDTT and IDG-type CC .

Although the MR manifestation of BDTT has been described in detail in the literature, the pathologic change and MR findings of distal segment of BDTT have been rarely reported in the literature. T1-weighted (T1W) hyperintense signal on the surface of distal segment of BDTT has been reported in the literature and is believed to be caused by hemobilia . However, to the best of our knowledge, the pathologic changes and the implications of T1W hyperintense signal on the surface of distal segment of BDTT have not been reported in the literature. To evaluate its significance in the diagnosis of BDTT, we retrospectively reviewed 29 cases of HCC with BDTT and compared the pathologic changes and MR findings of the distal segment of BDTT with those of 17 cases of IDG-type CC. This study mainly focused on the distal segment of BDTT and IDG-type CC.
