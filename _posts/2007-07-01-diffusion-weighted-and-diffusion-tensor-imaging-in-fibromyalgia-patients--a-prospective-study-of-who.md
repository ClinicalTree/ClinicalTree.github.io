Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain condition characterized by widespread pain and tenderness that afflicts 2%–4% of the population in industrialized countries ( ). It is the second most common rheumatologic disease after osteoarthritis. Although the underlying pathology, mediating the allodynia and hyperalgesia of FM remains poorly understood, a dysfunction in central neurobiologic structures is suspected. In addition to pain, FM patients often present with other syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, idiopathic low back pain, and temporomandibular disease syndrome, suggesting a common underlying pathology across these conditions ( ).

Although FM is defined by widespread tenderness, experimental data indicate that the enhanced pain sensitivity of FM is not limited to pressure stimuli alone. Individuals with FM also exhibit heightened pain sensitivity in response to multiple other stimuli, including heat, noise, and electricity ( ). These data, in conjunction with the finding that pain is not localized to a particular body region, suggest that this condition may be largely from the augmented central nervous system processing of pain.

The neurophysiology of pain processing has received increasing interest in recent years and data from different neuroimaging methods such as multiple positron emission tomography ( ), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ( ), functional magnetic resonance imaging ( ), and more recently magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy consistently identify the brain structures that are activated during painful conditions in healthy controls ( ). These structures include the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, the insula, the anterior cingulate, the thalamus, the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, and the basal ganglia ( ). Collectively, these regions have been termed the “pain matrix,” which is activated in response to painful stimulation. Interestingly, not all of the regions in the pain matrix serve the same functions in encoding pain ( ). Multiple studies have indicated that pain matrix exhibits abnormal activation patterns in FM, both at baseline and in response to painful stimuli ( ).

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which measures the diffusivity of water molecules, is a well-established MR imaging sequence commonly used in clinical practice to detection early ischemia ( ). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) yields quantitative measures for tissue water mobility as a function of the direction of water motion and is probed by application of diffusion-sensitization gradients in multiple directions ( ). Appropriate mathematical combination of the directional diffusion-weighted images provides quantitative measures of water diffusion for each voxel via the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), as well as the degree of diffusion directionality, or anisotropy ( ). DTI allows in vivo mapping of the anatomic connections in the human brain; previous studies have identified and confirmed the existence of an anatomic circuitry for the functionally characterized top-down influences on pain processing via brainstem structures in humans ( ).

Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a measure of the portion of the diffusion tensor from anisotropy.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether DWI and DTI can depict cerebral abnormalities in fibromyalgia patients and if significant differences in measured ADC histograms between these patients and normal controls exist. We hypothesized that if there were differences between fibromyalgia patients and controls in any brain region, that these abnormalities should be most pronounced in individuals with more severe pain, a lower pain threshold, or cognitions that are known to be associated with a poor prognosis in pain patients.
