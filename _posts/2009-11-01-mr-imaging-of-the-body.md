The indications and applications for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) are continually expanding, and in the era of “image gently” , MR is steadily replacing computed tomography for many diagnostic applications. MRI appears to be the imaging modality of choice for the future, and a thorough understanding of MR equipment, physics, pulse sequences, contrast agents, and image interpretation is essential for radiology residents, fellows, and practicing radiologists. In the preface of this text, the editors state that their aim was “to convey the basic principles and current information in the field of magnetic resonance diagnosis and to present the full range of MRI findings that are relevant in everyday practice.” Although this seems like a lofty goal, in just under 700 pages, this text provides an authoritative and surprisingly thorough discussion of MRI of the body.

_MR Imaging of the Body_ begins with a chapter addressing the basic principles of MRI, including MR physics, the components of an MRI system, and the basic principles of producing diagnostic-quality images. This chapter includes a discussion on MR contrast agents and their applications, risks and side effects of MRI, and image artifacts. This information is essential, and often ignored, knowledge for any radiologist attempting to perform and interpret diagnostic MR examinations. Many residents, fellows, and even practicing radiologists are intimidated by MR physics, and in being so seem to focus their attention away from this aspect of MRI. However, an understanding of this topic is imperative to attaining the highest quality examination possible and thereby making the correct diagnosis. This text provides a brief yet informative overview that will help radiologists understand the theory of MR and its application in diagnostic imaging.

The next nine chapters of this text proceed to discuss MRI of the entire body, with the exception of the central nervous system. Specific chapters cover head and neck, chest, abdomen, both the male and female pelvis, the female breast, musculoskeletal imaging, and MR angiography and venography. The final chapter addresses whole-body MR and high-field imaging at 3 T. Each chapter is divided into organ systems, and for each subdivision, there is a discussion of the relevant anatomy, normal MRI characteristics, and suggested techniques for imaging that organ specifically. A particular strength of each subheading is a table with recommended MRI protocols, an invaluable quick reference for radiologists seeking to tailor an examination to a specific indication. Although not an all-inclusive text with regard to the extent of pathology discussed, this text provides reasonable discussions of the more commonly encountered pathologies for each organ system. Handy, quick-reference bulleted tables follow each disease entity and address the characteristic MR findings for that process. _MR Imaging of the Body_ is wonderfully illustrated with images that are of high quality and visually depict the findings that are relevant for the specific disease entity. Each chapter concludes with a list of references and suggested reading if further detail is desired.

This text has many strengths that make it useful for residents, fellows, and practicing radiologists. The initial chapter clearly explains the physics concepts behind producing diagnostic-quality MR images. As the knowledge and range of applications for MRI has expanded, the arsenal of various organ-specific contrast agents has also grown. _MR Imaging of the Body_ provides an up-to-date briefing on these various agents, their specific utilities, and possible adverse effects. The organ-specific imaging protocols serve as a valuable quick reference for any radiologist seeking to tailor an examination to a specific clinical question or indication. The brief yet thorough discussions of the more commonly encountered pathologic processes provide enough information to allow for comfortable interpretation of the majority of MR examinations. One of the most beneficial qualities of the book is its innumerable high-quality images. The editors and the authors of the various chapters have obviously spent a great deal of time and effort in seeking out images that are not only of high quality but beautifully depict the pathology at hand. Although not unique to this text, there are many tables that list the most commonly encountered diagnostic differential diagnoses. Chapters addressing cardiac, breast, and whole-body MRI offer detail on the new and expanding applications for MRI.

The major weakness of _MR Imaging of the Body_ is that it is not an all-inclusive text. Although it concisely covers the more commonly encountered disease entities, there are many other pathologic processes that a radiologist may encounter in daily practice. Any practitioner who interprets a high volume of MR examinations will surely encounter pathology that is not discussed. In this regard, practicing radiologists may need more specialized texts if more specific detail is required. They may be better served by investing in the authoritative text for a specific organ system or application. However, the reference and suggested-reading sections that follow the various subdivisions of this text provide an excellent guide for further reading and investigation.

Overall, the editors of _MR Imaging of the Body_ have succeeded in their goal of producing a text that conveys the basic principles and current applications for MRI. This text is perfectly suited to radiology residents and fellows who are in search of a general overview of state-of-the-art MRI. Practicing radiologists seeking to incorporate MR into their daily practice would also find this book useful. Radiologists who are currently performing and interpreting a high volume or specifically tailored examinations would be better served by more focused and authoritative texts.
