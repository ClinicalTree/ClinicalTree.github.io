## Rationale and Objectives

To investigate the effect of different reporting methods and performance measures on the assessment of the benefit of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in characterizing malignant and benign breast lesions on mammography and sonography.

## Materials and Methods

In a previous study, 10 observers provided three types of reporting data (probability of malignancy \[PM\] estimates, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System \[BI-RADS\] ratings, and biopsy decisions), both without and with CAD. The current study compares alternative performance measures computed from the three types of reporting data. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was computed from both the PM estimates and the BI-RADS ratings, whereas sensitivity and specificity were computed from all three data types. Sensitivity and specificity values calculated from either the PM estimates or the BI-RADS ratings were determined by setting both constant and user-dependent thresholds. Student’s _t_ -tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in the performance measures without and with CAD.

## Results

The average AUC values of the 10 observers calculated from either PM estimates or BI-RADS ratings demonstrated statistically significant improvements in performance with CAD, increasing from 0.87 to 0.92 or 0.93, respectively. However, the statistical significance of improvements in sensitivity or specificity depended on the type of reporting data used.

## Conclusions

Use of different types of reporting data in the computation of sensitivity and specificity may result in different conclusions concerning the benefit of CAD. Meaningful determination of sensitivity and specificity from PM estimates require the use of user-dependent thresholds.

Accurate diagnostic interpretation of breast images requires that the radiologist visually identify various features known to be associated with malignancy or benignity. Considering such features together with the clinical findings, the radiologist must ultimately make a biopsy decision (ie, to recommend biopsy, follow-up, or no further action). To reduce confusion and increase standardization in malignant and benign feature identification on breast images, as well as in overall assessment of abnormality, the American College of Radiologists (ACR) provides reporting standards, known as the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), which include breast-imaging lexicons of descriptors and a group of assessment categories ( ). Lexicons for mammography, breast sonography, and magnetic resonance imaging are available. The assessment categories used in diagnostic workup are: 1) negative, 2) benign findings, 3) probably benign findings—initial short-interval follow-up suggested, 4) suspicious abnormality—biopsy should be considered, and 5) highly suggestive of malignancy. The ACR recommends that a probably benign assessment should be given to those cases with a probability of malignancy of less than 2%, whereas a highly suggestive of malignancy assessment be reserved for those cases with probability of malignancy greater than 95%. Abnormalities found suspicious can be subdivided into categories 4a) low probability of malignancy, 4b) intermediate probability of malignancy, and 4c) high probability of malignancy. Diagnostic workup of breast abnormalities therefore requires that the radiologist report various types of data, including feature descriptors, categoric assessment, rough probability of malignancy (PM) estimates, and biopsy decision.

Improvements in reporting standards have resulted in improved accuracy in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Nonetheless, radiologists still fail to correctly characterize malignant and benign breast lesions. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been investigated as a method of improving radiologists’ diagnostic accuracy in the interpretation of breast lesions on both mammography and sonography ( and the references therein). To determine the benefit of CAD to the performance of radiologists in differentiating malignant and benign breast lesions, observer studies are frequently conducted ( ). During such studies, observers are shown the images from a number of different cases, first without and then with the CAD. Under each reading condition, the observer is asked to report some sort of data—for example, a BI-RADS category, a rating on a scale of 0 to 100 representing the observer’s estimate of the lesion’s PM, or a biopsy decision on whether to biopsy or not. These reporting data can then be used to compute unaided and aided performance measures, which serve to quantify the performance of each observer in the task of distinguishing malignant from benign lesions under each reading condition. For example, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis ( ) of either the BI-RADS or PM ratings can be used to compute the area under the ROC curve (AUC) performance measure.
