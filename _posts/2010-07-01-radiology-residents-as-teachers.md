## Rationale and Objectives

Radiology residents often teach medical students and other residents. Workshops developed with the goal of improving resident teaching skills are becoming increasingly common in various fields of medicine. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and structure of resident-teacher training opportunities within radiology programs in the United States.

## Method and Materials

Program directors with membership in the Association of Program Directors in Radiology (APDR) were surveyed to determine views on a panel of topics related to resident-teacher training programs.

## Results

A total of 114 (56%) of 205 APDR members completed an online survey. Approximately one-third (32%) stated that their program provided instruction to residents on teaching skills. The majority of these programs (72%) were established within the last 5 years. Residents provided teaching to medical students (94%) and radiology residents (90%). The vast majority of program directors agreed that it is important for residents to teach (98%) and that these teaching experiences helped residents become better radiologists (85%). Ninety-four percent of program directors felt that the teaching skills of their residents could be improved, and 85% felt that residents would benefit from instruction on teaching methods. Only one-third of program directors felt their program adequately recognized teaching provided by residents.

## Conclusion

Program directors identified residents as being active contributors to teaching in most programs. Although teaching was viewed as an important skill to develop, few programs had instituted a resident-teacher curriculum. Program directors felt that residents would benefit from structured training to enhance teaching skills. Future studies are needed to determine how best to provide teaching skills training for radiology trainees.

Residents contribute to the teaching of medical students and residents, and spend up to one-quarter of their work hours teaching, evaluating or supervising trainees . Although many residents enjoy teaching and consider it to be an important component of their training , many feel inadequately prepared to teach . Formal instruction in effective teaching methods is desired by resident trainees .

Postgraduate accrediting bodies, including the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, consider teaching skills to be among a group of core competencies that residents must achieve during their training . Subsequently, the last decade has witnessed an increase in resident-focused workshops geared toward helping residents improve their teaching skills . In 2001, approximately one-half of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education–accredited residency programs in family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, general surgery, and obstetrics-gynecology had established programs for residents to improve their teaching skills .
