## Rationale and Objectives

We sought to intraindividually compare intravascular contrast enhancement in multidector computed tomography (MDCT) of the chest using contrast media (CM) containing 300 and 400 mg iodine/ml.

## Materials and Methods

Seventy-one patients underwent repeated MDCT scanning of the chest at baseline and follow-up. CM with standard iodine (protocol A: 300 mg iodine/ml; Iopromide 300) and high iodine concentration (protocol B: 400 mg iodine/ml; Iomeprol 400) were used. The iodine delivery rate (1.29 g iodine/s) and total iodine load (37 g iodine) were identical for the two protocols. Contrast enhancement was measured in the right and left ventricles, pulmonary trunk, right and left pulmonary arteries, and ascending and descending aortas. Results were compared using paired _t_ -tests; _P_ values were adjusted using Bonferroni correction ( _P_ ≤ .005).

## Results

Contrast enhancement values showed no statistically significant differences between the two protocols at all anatomic sites (all _P_ \> .005). In the right ventricle, pulmonary trunk, and right and left pulmonary arteries, higher attenuation values for protocol A were detected compared to protocol B (379.0 ± 110.5 vs. 349.8 ± 117.6, 354.5 ± 112.2 vs 330.9 ± 118.3, 348.6 ± 106.0 vs. 321.8 ± 109.9, and 347.9 ± 102.4 vs. 321.0 ± 104.9 HU, respectively). After the lung circulation (left ventricle, ascending aorta, and descending aorta), attenuation values were marginally higher for protocol B. Using both protocols resulted in suitable contrast enhancement with a mean pulmonary attenuation higher than 300 HU.

## Conclusions

Using an adapted injection protocol, the administration of 300 and 400 mg iodine CM resulted in a suitable intravascular contrast enhancement in the chest. The use of 400 mg iodine CM does not lead to a statistically significant improvement in contrast enhancement compared to the 300 mg iodine CM.

Computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) is performed in daily routine and is an important diagnostic procedure for the evaluation of the vessels, such as in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. The quality of CTA is mainly influenced by the intravascular contrast enhancement obtained. A high vessel attenuation is crucial for an excellent identification of small vessels. The arterial contrast enhancement is determined by the iodine delivery rate (IDR) (i.e., the amount of iodine per time \[gram of iodine per second\]). The IDR can be increased either by using an increased flow rate or by injection of a contrast medium (CM) containing a higher concentration of iodine ( ). The development of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) has led to new injection protocols for contrast medium due to faster scanning times and larger scanning volumes. Furthermore, a thinner collimation is used; therefore, the structure of peripheral pulmonary arteries can be examined in more detail and subsegmental pulmonary emboli can be detected ( ).

Previous studies reported that the use of highly concentrated iodinated contrast media led to a higher intravascular and parenchymal attenuation compared to the administration of standard contrast media ( ). However, the results of these studies are often controversial and not comparable as different injection protocols with inconsistent IDRs or different total amounts of iodine were used. Furthermore, the comparison of the contrast enhancement was performed interindividually with the great disadvantage of interpatient variables such as age, body weight, cardiac output, and/or circulation times. These factors influence contrast enhancement significantly and can result in a wide range of enhancement values among these patients, although the same injection protocol is used ( ).

There were no statistically significant differences between the two protocols at all measured anatomic sites. However, in the anatomic sites located before the lung circulation, the mean attenuation showed higher values for the 300 mg iodine CM compared to the 400 mg iodine CM. After the lung circulation, marginally higher attenuation values for the 400 mg iodine CM were measured.
