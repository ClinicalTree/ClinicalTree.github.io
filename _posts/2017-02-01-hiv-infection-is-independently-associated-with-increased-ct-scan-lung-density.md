## Rationale and Objectives

Noninfectious pulmonary complications are common among HIV-infected individuals and may be detected early by quantitative computed tomography (CT) scanning. The association of HIV disease markers with CT lung density measurement remains poorly understood.

## Materials and Methods

One hundred twenty-five participants free of spirometry-defined lung disease were recruited from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals to undergo standardized CT scan of the chest. Parenchymal density for the entire lung volume was calculated using computerized software. Qualitative assessment of CT scans was conducted by two radiologists masked to HIV status. Linear regression models were developed to determine the independent association of markers of HIV infection on inspiratory scan mean lung density (MLD).

## Results

HIV-infected participants had a significantly higher MLD (denser lung) compared to HIV-uninfected participants (−815 Hounsfield unit \[HU\] vs −837 HU; _P_ = 0.002). After adjusting for relevant covariates, HIV infection was independently associated with 19.9 HU higher MLD (95% CI 6.04 to 33.7 HU; _P_ = 0.005). In qualitative assessment, only ground glass attenuation and cysts were noted more commonly among HIV-infected individuals compared to HIV-uninfected individuals (34% vs 17% \[ _P_ = 0.045\] and 27% vs 10% \[ _P_ = 0.03\], respectively). No qualitative radiographic abnormalities attenuated the association between HIV infection and increased MLD.

## Conclusions

HIV infection is independently associated with increased lung density. Although qualitative CT abnormalities were common in this cohort, only ground glass attenuation and cysts were noted more frequently in HIV-infected participants, suggesting that the increased lung density observed among HIV-infected individuals may be associated with subclinical inflammatory lung changes.

## Introduction

With the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), noninfectious pulmonary complications of HIV infection including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and pulmonary hypertension have increasingly been recognized as key contributors to the morbidity and mortality of the HIV-infected population . A focus of many studies has been to understand how different tools (ie, spirometry, diffusing capacity, chest imaging) can detect HIV-associated lung changes earlier in the course of the pulmonary disease . Qualitative and quantitative computed tomography (CT) permits the assessment of lung changes that may develop prior to clinically overt lung disease. Several studies have examined the CT findings in HIV-infected individuals from varying populations with different risk factors for lung disease . Qualitative abnormalities, including emphysema, nodules, and bronchiectasis are common in HIV-infected individuals, with one study reporting 55% of HIV-infected individuals having a radiographic abnormality . Quantitative measurements, which use computerized software to calculate the density of each voxel of the lung image, can be employed to determine overall lung density (measured in Hounsfield unit \[HU\]). Both decreased lung density (as seen in emphysema) and increased lung density (as seen in fibrotic lung disease) have been reported in HIV-infected populations . The association of HIV disease markers (viral load, CD4 cell count) with CT lung density measurement remains poorly understood. As well, the qualitative lung CT changes contributing to quantitative changes in HIV have not been reported.

The Study of HIV Infection in the Etiology of Lung Diseases (SHIELD) is a National Institutes of Health-funded longitudinal cohort study of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected participants followed to understand how HIV may enhance susceptibility to lung disease. Within this study, both HIV-infected and uninfected individuals undergo standardized spirometry testing and research lung CT imaging. In this analysis, we determine the independent association of HIV infection with quantitative lung density from 125 SHIELD participants with normal lung function (assessed via spirometry testing). Using a standardized qualitative CT review, we assess the relationship between qualitative and quantitative CT changes to identify processes contributing to lung CT changes in HIV infection.
