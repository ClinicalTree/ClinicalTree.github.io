## Rationale and Objectives

This study aimed to develop whole-lesion apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-based entropy-related parameters of cervical cancer to preliminarily assess intratumoral heterogeneity of this lesion in comparison to adjacent normal cervical tissues.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 51 women (mean age, 49 years) with cervical cancers confirmed by biopsy underwent 3-T pelvic diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with b values of 0 and 800 s/mm  2 prospectively. ADC-based entropy-related parameters including first-order entropy and second-order entropies were derived from the whole tumor volume as well as adjacent normal cervical tissues. Intraclass correlation coefficient, Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction, Kruskal-Wallis test, and receiver operating characteristic curve were used for statistical analysis.

## Results

All the parameters showed excellent interobserver agreement (all intraclass correlation coefficients  > 0.900). Entropy, entropy(H)  0 , entropy(H)  45 , entropy(H)  90 , entropy(H)  135 , and entropy(H)  mean were significantly higher, whereas entropy(H)  range and entropy(H)  std were significantly lower in cervical cancers compared to adjacent normal cervical tissues (all _P_ <.0001). Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there were no significant differences among the values of various second-order entropies including entropy(H)  0, entropy(H)  45 , entropy(H)  90 , entropy(H)  135 , and entropy(H)  mean. All second-order entropies had larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve than first-order entropy in differentiating cervical cancers from adjacent normal cervical tissues. Further, entropy(H)  45 , entropy(H)  90 , entropy(H)  135 , and entropy(H)  mean had the same largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867.

## Conclusion

Whole-lesion ADC-based entropy-related parameters of cervical cancers were developed successfully, which showed initial potential in characterizing intratumoral heterogeneity in comparison to adjacent normal cervical tissues.

## Introduction

According to the World Cancer Report 2014 of the World Health Organization (WHO), uterine cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality in women across the globe. Cervical cancer exhibits various kinds of heterogeneity on both genetic and histopathologic levels such as gene expression, metabolism, angiogenesis, proliferative potential, and cellular morphology . Previous studies have shown that cervical cancers with high intratumoral heterogeneity may have poorer prognosis . Thus, assessing tumor heterogeneity accurately before therapy is of utmost importance for dedicated evaluation, treatment planning, and prognosis prediction in patients with cervical cancers. However, the goal of accurate assessment of tumor heterogeneity through routine clinical procedure such as biopsy cannot be achieved because the procedure only reflects features within a small sample of the entire tumor. Fortunately, multiple image modalities, such as magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), have been widely used clinically for preoperative staging or follow-up, which hold great potential to assess the heterogeneity of the tumor as a whole from very different and important perspectives. For example, PET reflected the heterogeneity in terms of metabolism and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging investigated it in terms of angiogenic processes .

Diffusion-weighted (DW) MR imaging (DWI) has been used more and more widely with versatile applications in various diseases, especially in female pelvic tumors including cervical cancer . DWI could reflect the motion of water molecules constrained by tissue ultrastructures noninvasively in a quantitative term of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, which underwent great change during carcinogenesis . DWI therefore has the potential to assess tumor heterogeneity of cervical cancers from a certain perspective of cellular morphology and tissue ultrastructures.

where G is the number of gray levels within the VOI. _p  i_ represents the probability of gray level _i_ across the VOI and is computed by dividing the number of the gray level _i_ by the total pixel number within the VOI. First-order entropy is a statistical measure of variation of gray levels so that it equals to 0 when all values are the same within the VOI and increases as data present larger variation.

For simplicity, let the grid of numeric gray-levels (a) represent a 3 × 3 image with 2 gray levels. For distance d = 1, direction θ = 0 ° , GLCM (b) is calculated from the grid. Take the GLCM element in row 1, column 2 for example (circle in (b) ).
