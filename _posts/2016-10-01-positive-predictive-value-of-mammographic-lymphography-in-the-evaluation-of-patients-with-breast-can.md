## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to investigate the positive predictive value (PPV) of mammographic lymphography (MLG) for assessing malignant breast disease and lymphatic metastasis in patients in a typical clinical setting.

## Materials and Methods

Patients who underwent mammography with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 4 or 5 lesions and had abnormal mammographic findings in the upper-outer quadrant of the breast were enrolled. Next, MLG was performed. A water-soluble agent was subcutaneously injected into the upper-outer periareolar region of the bilateral breast, and mammography was then performed. Morphologic characteristics, including lymphatic vessel development, the presence of lymphatic vessel defects, and dilation, were recorded for evaluation.

## Results

Fifty-one patients with BI-RADS category 4 lesions and 40 patients with BI-RADS category 5 lesions were included in the study. Sixty-one patients were found to have malignant disease, whereas 30 patients were found to have benign disease. Morphologic characteristics were recorded for evaluation. The interobserver agreement was evaluated and was classified as excellent according to kappa analysis. The PPV of MLG characteristics for malignant breast disease and lymphatic metastasis was analyzed by logistic regression, and the presentation of a lymphatic vessel defect was the most predictive characteristic of a malignancy (PPV: 0.89; _P_ value: 0.02) in patients with BI-RADS category 4 lesions. Meanwhile, in patients with malignant breast disease, the PPVs for predicting lymphatic metastasis with lymphatic vessel defect and dilation were 0.50 ( _P_ value: 0.02) and 0.67 ( _P_ value: <0.01), respectively.

## Conclusion

The assessment of morphologic characteristics by MLG has the potential to predict malignant breast disease and lymphatic metastasis.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths among females, accounting for 23% of the total cancer cases and 14% of the cancer deaths worldwide . Malignant spread to axillary lymph nodes is one of the most important predictors of survival in patients with breast cancer, increasing the 10-year recurrence rate from 20%–30% to nearly 70% . Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping and biopsy are currently performed intraoperatively via a radiocolloid scintigraphic method combined with the use of a blue dye . Although this method has proven to be successful for SLN mapping, a technique is still required to determine the condition of the lymphatic system preoperatively. Imaging via the intradermal injection of a contrast agent in the breast under another modality is thought to be a safe method to evaluate the condition of the lymphatic system. A previous study demonstrated that computed tomographic (CT) lymphography using the non-ionic contrast medium iopamidol is useful in SLN evaluation, and patients with a positive result tend to have some typical features in lymphography that are absent in patients proven to be negative by SLN biopsy . However, the true value of these features in diagnosis has not yet been properly discussed. Theoretically, the lymphatic vessel may also be visible in mammography through the use of intradermal contrast injection under CT. Thus, the objective of this study was to retrospectively investigate the positive predictive value (PPV) of imaging characteristics in mammographic lymphography (MLG) to predict lymphatic metastasis in patients in a typical clinical setting. Meanwhile, the value of the imaging characteristics associated with MLG in predictive malignancy is also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first attempt to study the value of lymphography under mammography.

## Materials and Methods

The protocol in our study was approved by the institutional review board of our hospital, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Patients who underwent mammography and were assigned Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) classifications of 4 or 5 from June 2009 through January 2011 were all enrolled in our study, whereas pregnant patients and patients with a history of axillary lymphadenectomy and renal insufficiency were excluded.
