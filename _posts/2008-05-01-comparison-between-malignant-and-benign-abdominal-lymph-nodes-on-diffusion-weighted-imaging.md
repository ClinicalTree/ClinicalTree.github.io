## Rationale and Objectives

The purpose of this study is to review the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of benign and metastatic abdominal lymph nodes on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-eight patients with a total of 40 benign (20 patients) and 16 malignant (8 patients) lymph nodes who underwent DWI MRI of the abdomen (b = 0.600) were enrolled in the study. ADC values of the lymph nodes were measured and comparison was made between benign and malignant groups.

## Results

Mean ADC value of lymph nodes was 2.38 ± 0.29 and 1.84 ± 0.37 × 10  −3 mm  2 /sec in the benign and malignant groups, respectively. There was a significant statistical difference between the ADC values of benign and malignant lymph nodes ( _P_ < .0005).

## Conclusion

A wide range of ADC values exist in patients with metastatic abdominal lymph nodes, with a tendency of higher ADC values in benign lymph nodes.

Evaluation of lymph node metastases is important for oncologic staging. Histopathologic analysis is the most accurate way to determine the composition of lymph nodes and can differentiate between benign and malignant involvement. Tissue sampling can be very challenging in the abdomen and inadequate samples are not uncommon. This may lead to false-negative results ( ). Imaging has been used for staging of oncology patients, including lymph node assessment. Lymph nodes can be detected on imaging by their increased size, but standard imaging modalities may be indeterminate for the nature of enlargement. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography have been used to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes according to the amount of radioactive tracer uptake ( ). Despite their increased specificity, false-negative and false-positive diagnoses may occur. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been used in oncologic imaging for the depiction and characterization of tumors as well as differentiating benign from malignant lesions ( ). In this study, we reviewed the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of lymph nodes visualized on routine abdomen MRI images and their relationship with the final clinical diagnosis.

## Materials and methods

## Patients

This study was performed retrospectively and is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant. The institutional review board approved the study and waived the requirement for informed consent for the retrospective patient data review. After a review of medical, radiologic, and pathologic records obtained between September 2004 and January 2007 in our institution, 28 patients with reported abdominal lymph nodes on MRI were included in the study who had their final diagnoses determined by histopathology, integrated  18 F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) PET computed tomography (CT), or follow-up imaging. Time interval between final diagnosis and MRI was no longer than 4 weeks in all of the malignant cases. None of the patients in the malignant group had been treated for their diseases prior to imaging.
