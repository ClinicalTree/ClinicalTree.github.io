## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was too assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiofrequency (RF)–related heating of conductive wire coils used in magnetically steerable endovascular catheters.

## Materials and Methods

A three-axis microcoil was fabricated onto a 1.8Fr catheter tip. In vitro testing was performed on a 1.5-T MRI system using an agarose gel–filled vessel phantom, a transmit-receive body RF coil, a steady-state free precession pulse sequence, and a fluoroptic thermometry system. Temperature was measured without simulated blood flow at varying distances from the magnet isocenter and at varying flip angles. Additional experiments were performed with laser-lithographed single-axis microcoil-tipped microcatheters in air and in a saline bath with varied grounding of the microcoil wires. Preliminary in vivo evaluation of RF heating was performed in pigs at 1.5 T with coil-tipped catheters in various positions in the common carotid arteries with steady-state free precession pulse sequence on and off and under physiologic-flow and zero-flow conditions.

## Results

In tissue-mimicking agarose gel, RF heating resulted in a maximal temperature increase of 0.35°C after 15 minutes of imaging, 15 cm from the magnet isocenter. For a single-axis microcoil, maximal temperature increases were 0.73°C to 1.91°C in air and 0.45°C to 0.55°C in saline. In vivo, delayed contrast-enhanced MRI revealed no evidence of vascular injury, and histopathologic sections from the common carotid arteries confirmed the lack of vascular damage.

## Conclusions

Microcatheter tip microcoils for endovascular catheter steering in MRI experience minimal RF heating under the conditions tested. These data provide the basis for further in vivo testing of this promising technology for endovascular interventional MRI.

Current applied to copper microcoils placed at the tip of an endovascular device can be used to steer a catheter within a clinical magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) scanner . The current applied induces a magnetic moment within the coils at the catheter tip, which experiences a torque in the presence of the scanner main magnetic field, producing remotely controllable deflections that can be used for navigating vessel turns and branches or holding the catheter tip in a specific orientation. The electric currents required to generate the desired magnetic moments, however, can generate enough heat through resistive dissipation to cause temperatures unsafe for blood or vascular walls. We have shown that undesirable temperature increases due to resistive heating can be mitigated using high–thermal conductivity material for the catheter tip and flowing saline coolant through the catheter lumen (see the accompanying report, “Steerable Catheter Microcoils for Interventional MRI: Reducing Resistive Heating,” in this issue \[3\]).

Undesirable heating, however, may also occur in a long wire (eg, a guidewire) running down the lumen of the catheter because of field coupling with radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields used for MRI through the “antenna effect” . Metallic devices used in MRI-guided endovascular procedures, such as guidewires, braided catheters, catheter tracking coils, or intravascular imaging coils, even if not ferromagnetic, have the potential to interact with the time-varying RF electromagnetic fields from the RF transmitter, causing heating in and near the device and thus posing a hazard to the patient. The concentration of RF power within such devices may cause a significant increase in the specific absorption rate (SAR) of the surrounding tissue, potentially resulting in excessive local temperature rise and burns .
