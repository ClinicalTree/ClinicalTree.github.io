## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability of right ventricular (RV) functional parameters as evaluated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with acquired heart disease (AHD), and to identify factors associated with an increased variability.

## Materials and Methods

Sixty consecutive patients were enrolled. Right and left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction, and mass were determined from short-axis cine sequences. All analyzes were performed twice by three observers with various training-degree in cardiac MRI. Intra- and inter-observer variability was evaluated. The impact on variability of each of the following parameters was assessed: observer's experience, basal and apical slices selection, end-systolic phase selection, and delineation.

## Results

Mean segmentation time ranged 9.8–19.0 minutes for RV and 6.4–9.2 minutes for LV. Variability of RV functional parameters measurement was strongly influenced by previous observer's experience: it was two to three times superior to that of LV, even for the most experienced observer. High variability in the measurement of RV mass was observed. For both ventricles, selection of the basal slice and delineation were major determinants of variability.

## Conclusion

As compared to LV, RV function assessment with cardiac MRI in AHD patients is much more variable and time-consuming. Observer's experience, selection of basal slice, and delineation are determinant.

## Introduction

The assessment of right ventricular (RV) function is essential in cardiac diseases and its prognostic value was reported in both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies . Contrary to the left ventricle, the right ventricle is often considered difficult to evaluate with current imaging techniques, mainly because of its complex motion and geometry . Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the reference method of RV functional evaluation, for both clinical and research purposes . Previous studies stated that variability of RV function as estimated by cardiac MRI was comparable to that of the left ventricle . However, some of these results were obtained with long processing times (up to 45 minutes) incompatible with routine practice . Moreover, most published studies have evaluated the RV function variability either in healthy volunteers or in patients with congenital heart disease . On contrary, few studies have evaluated variability in patients with acquired heart disease (AHD). Most of them comprised limited sample size and were limited to a specific disorder . Consequently, the extension of those published results to clinical practice is questionable. Furthermore, to our knowledge, previous reports did not evaluate the factors associated with an increased variability, particularly the effect of cardiac MRI experience and processing steps .

The aim of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability of RV functional parameters as evaluated by cardiac MRI in patients with AHD, and to identify factors associated with an increased variability.
