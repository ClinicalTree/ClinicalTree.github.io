## Rationale and Objectives

To improve resident oral case communication and preparatory skills by providing residents an opportunity to prepare for and conduct a new interdisciplinary Radiology-Pathology (Rad-Path) conference series.

## Materials and Methods

To assess whether conference goals were being achieved, we surveyed trainees and attendings in the radiology and pathology departments. Percentages were examined for each variable. Mann-Whitney _U_ test for ordinal variable significance was applied to determine statistical significance between radiology trainee and attending survey responses.

## Results

Most surveyed radiology trainees (57.1%) strongly agreed or agreed with: “I wish I felt more comfortable with oral presentations.” Sixty-five percent of radiology attendings (34 of 52) either agreed or strongly agreed that the residents should be more comfortable with oral case presentations. Of resident Rad-Path conference presenters, 69% (9 of 13) either agreed or strongly agreed that the conference improved their confidence and/or ability to present case information orally. Of responders who attended at least one Rad-Path conference in person, 83% of residents (19/23) and 61% (17/28) of attendings agreed or strongly agreed that the conference improved their ability to formulate a differential diagnosis. Using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test, no significant difference was found between radiology trainees and attendings' responses.

## Conclusions

Our Rad-Path correlation conference was specifically designed and structured to provide residents with focused experience in formal oral case preparation and presentation. We consider our conference a success, with 69% of resident presenters reporting that the Rad-Path conference improved their confidence and/or ability to present case information orally.

## Introduction

Communication skills, and specifically the art of case presentation, have been a focus of resident education throughout the history of the field of radiology. Indeed, the oral board examination format was previously a test of those skills. With the recent shift to an exclusively “written” board examination format, resident teaching and preparatory activities, particularly those targeting senior residents, have taken a different form both at our institution and anecdotally, nationwide. At a time when our value as radiologists hinges not on the number of reports we produce but rather on our ability to improve patient outcomes by communicating more effectively with patients and referring clinicians, there is an increasing need for focused educational activities to strengthen these skills in our residents.

In the Fall of 2014, we initiated a Radiology-Pathology (Rad-Path) correlation conference series specifically designed to provide residents an opportunity to independently prepare for and conduct an interdisciplinary conference. The major goal was to improve resident case communication skills and case preparatory skills. Expected secondary goals were to expand our residents' ability to formulate differential diagnoses and to promote their appreciation of radiology and pathology as interrelated and often codependent disciplines.
