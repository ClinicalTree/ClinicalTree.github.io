## Rationale and Objectives

Pulmonary edema and pulmonary hypertension are postsurgical complications of pneumonectomy that may represent the remaining pulmonary vasculature's inability to accommodate the entirety of the cardiac output. Quantification of the aggregate pulmonary vascular cross-sectional area (CSA) has been used to study the development of pulmonary vascular disease in smokers. In this study, we applied this technique to demonstrate the potential utility of pulmonary vascular quantification in surgical risk assessment. Our hypothesis was that those subjects with the lowest aggregate vascular CSA in the nonoperative lung would be most likely to have elevated pulmonary vascular pressures in the postoperative period.

## Materials and Methods

A total of 61 subjects with postoperative hemodynamics and adequate imaging were identified from 159 patients undergoing pneumonectomies for mesothelioma. The total CSA of blood vessels perpendicular to the plane of computed tomographic (CT) scan slices was computed for blood vessels <5 mm  2 (CSA 5 mm). This measurement expressed as a percentage of lung parenchyma area (CSA 5%) was compared to postoperative hemodynamic measurements obtained by right heart catheterization.

## Results

In patients where a contrasted CT scan was used ( _n_ = 26), CSA 5% was correlated with postoperative day 0 minimum cardiac index ( _R_ = 0.37, _P_ = .03) but not with the maximum pulmonary arterial pressures. In patients with noncontrast CT scans ( _n_ = 35), CSA 5% was inversely correlated with postoperative day 0 maximum pulmonary arterial pressures ( _R_ = 0.43, _P_ = .03) but not with the minimum cardiac index. The preoperative perfusion fraction of the nonsurgical lung did not correlate with postoperative hemodynamics.

## Conclusions

CSA of pulmonary vasculature with an area ≤5 mm  2 has potential in estimating the ability of pulmonary vascular bed to accommodate postsurgical changes in pneumonectomy.

A detailed preprocedure assessment of patients undergoing lung resection has become a key component for the estimation of perioperative risk . In the case of patients undergoing pneumonectomy, the goals of this evaluation is to predict postoperative lung function, the potential for ventilatory compromise, pulmonary edema, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) . Such patients are also at an increased risk for the development of both transient elevations of pulmonary arterial pressures (PAPs) and sustained postoperative pulmonary hypertension . Previous studies suggest that preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance and intraoperative PAPs are predictive of postoperative respiratory failure and mortality . In another example, the risk of developing postoperative pulmonary edema and ARDS was related to the preoperative distribution of lung perfusion . In aggregate, the risk for developing postpneumonectomy complications appears to be related to the ability of the nonoperative lung to accommodate an increase in blood flow to the full cardiac output. Noninvasive identification of compromised pulmonary vasculature in the nonoperative lung may reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this procedure.

Our group has previously described a semiautomated quantification method to calculate the total cross-sectional area (CSA) of the pulmonary vasculature on computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest. The objective of these efforts is to develop and refine techniques to characterize vascular architecture from imaging. Using these tools, we hypothesized that those subjects with the smallest vascular CSA in the nonoperative lung as assessed by preoperative CT scans would be at greatest risk for hemodynamic compromise in the immediate postoperative period. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed a secondary analysis of clinically acquired CT scans and hemodynamic data on subjects undergoing extrapleural pneumonectomy at our institution.
