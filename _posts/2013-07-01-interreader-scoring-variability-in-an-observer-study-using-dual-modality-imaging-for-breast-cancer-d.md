## Rationale and Objectives

To evaluate variability in the clinical assessment of breast images, we evaluated scoring behavior of radiologists in a retrospective reader study combining x-ray mammography (XRM) and three-dimensional automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) for breast cancer detection in women with dense breasts.

## Methods

The study involved 17 breast radiologists in a sequential study design with readers first interpreting XRM-alone followed by an interpretation of combined XRM + ABUS. Each interpretation included a forced Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System scale and a likelihood that the woman had breast cancer. The analysis included 164 asymptomatic patients, including 31 breast cancer patients, with dense breasts and a negative screening XRM. Of interest were interreader scoring variability for XRM-alone, XRM + ABUS, and the sequential effect. In addition, a simulated double reading by pairs of readers of XRM + ABUS was investigated. Performance analysis included receiver operating characteristic analysis, percentile analysis, and κ statistics. Bootstrapping was used to determine statistical significance.

## Results

The median change in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve after ABUS interpretation was 0.12 (range 0.04–0.19). Reader agreement was fair with the median interreader κ being 0.26 (0.05–0.48) for XRM-alone and 0.34 (0.11–0.55) for XRM + ABUS (95% confidence interval for the difference in κ, 0.06–0.11). Simulated double reading of XRM + ABUS demonstrated tradeoffs in sensitivity and specificity, but conservative simulated double reading resulted in a significant improvement in both sensitivity (16.7%) and specificity (7.6%) with respect to XRM-alone.

## Conclusion

A modest, but statistically significant, increase in interreader agreement was observed after interpretation of ABUS.

Breast imaging methods for the early detection and diagnosis of cancer continue to evolve. Mammography, as the primary screening modality, allows for the early detection of nonpalpable breast cancers and has been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality . Although the overall sensitivity of mammography is 70% to 90%, the sensitivity can range from 30% to 98% depending on whether the breast consists mostly of extremely dense glandular tissue or contains mostly fat . Tumors diagnosed in women with dense breast tissue are currently usually larger and of higher histological grade with a greater likelihood of lymph node metastases, resulting in poorer prognosis . Moreover, the presence of dense breast tissue is associated with an elevated risk for breast cancer with the relative risk more than 5 times greater for women with the most dense breast tissue than for women without dense breast tissue . Nearly 40% of women in the United States have dense breasts and the poor sensitivity of mammography in women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) composition/density 3 or 4 has resulted in several states passing legislation requiring women be informed of the breast density and the possible need for additional screening with modalities other than mammography .

Based on initial clinical studies using conventional ultrasound , the addition of automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) to screening x-ray mammography (XRM) is expected to yield a benefit to patients with dense breast tissue by providing earlier detection of breast cancers that might be missed by mammography. Hence, a multireader multicase (MRMC) clinical reader study was conducted evaluating the use of ABUS in conjunction with XRM in the breast cancer screening of women with dense breasts and a negative screening XRM (tumor BI-RADS assessment category 1 or 2) . That study involved both semicontinuous reader scoring data (the likelihood of malignancy) and two-category data (cancer versus noncancer) . The reader-assigned likelihoods of malignancy served as the decision variables in an MRMC receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis . The BI-RADS assessment categories were used to determine sensitivity and specificity given a predetermined cutoff for the distinction between patients with and without cancer. A statistically significant increase in the overall area under the ROC curve was obtained as well as a statistically significant increase in sensitivity, while a slight decline in specificity failed to reach statistical significance (  Table 1 ) (and Giger et al, manuscript in preparation). In contrast, the work presented here focused more on individual readers and cases and analyzed (1) the reader scoring behavior of the participating radiologists, (2) agreement (or lack thereof) between readers, (3) the impact of the consecutive reading with two modalities (XRM and ABUS in this instance), and (4) the potential of improvement from double reading by pairs of readers. The latter was done through simulations using the reader data. It is important to note that it was not our intent to critique individual radiologists or to determine which radiologist was “better.”
