## Rationale and Objective

The objective of this study was to assess an optimized renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol regarding reduction of contrast volume.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty patients underwent MP-CTA (12 phases, every 3.5 seconds, 80 kV/120 mAs) using 30 mL of contrast medium. The quality of MP-CTA was assessed quantitatively measuring vessel attenuation, image noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio. MP-CTA was evaluated qualitatively regarding depiction of vessels, cortex differentiation, and motion artifacts (grades 1–4, 1 = best). Mean effective radiation dose was registered. Results were compared to standard renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) (80 mL). Student _t_ test was applied, if variables followed normal distribution. For other variables, nonparametric Mann-Whitney _U_ test was used.

## Results

All acquisitions were successfully performed, and no patient had to be excluded from the study. MP-CTA enabled high attenuation (aorta: 503 ± 91 HU, renal arteries: 450 ± 73 HU/456 ± 72 HU) at adequate image noise (13.7 ± 1.5) and good contrast-to-noise ratio (34.2 ± 10.2). Good attenuation of renal veins was observed (286 ± 43 HU/282 ± 42 HU). Arterial enhancement was significantly higher compared to renal CTA (aorta: 396 ± 90 HU, renal arteries: 331 ± 74 HU/333 ± 80 HU; _P_ < .001). MP-CTA protocol enabled good image quality of renal arteries (1.5 ± 0.6) and veins (1.7 ± 0.6). Cortex differentiation and motion artifacts were ranked 1.8 ± 0.8 and 1.6 ± 0.8. The mean effective radiation dose was 9 mSv (MP-CTA).

## Conclusions

Compared to standard renal CTA, the renal MP-CTA enabled the significant reduction of contrast volume and simultaneously provided a significantly higher arterial attenuation.

## Introduction

One of the main indications for renal computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the assessment of secondary hypertension, because a common cause of renovascular hypertension is renal artery stenosis (RAS). RAS is defined as a narrowing of the renal artery or of their branches and most often is caused by atherosclerosis (90%) . Usually, the plaque formation is located within 1 cm to the ostium and often begins in the aortic wall with progression into the renal artery lumen . Less frequently, RAS is related to fibromuscular dysplasia, which is a vascular disease of medium-sized arteries and most commonly affects renal arteries . During the clinical course, typical signs of renal, rather than essential, hypertension include an acute increase in hypertension, severe hypertension, or a refractory hypertension . Moreover, age, female gender, reduced renal function, increased systolic blood pressure, and peripheral arterial disease are associated with RAS . In a patient collective with the findings mentioned previously, a noninvasive screening is indicated. CTA represents a highly reliable technique for detection of RAS that can be used as a screening test and for interventional treatment planning like percutaneous transluminal angioplasty . Because of its advantages, such as noninvasiveness and high spatial resolution, CTA has also demonstrated strength in the evaluation of other vascular complications such as renal artery embolisms, renal arterial aneurysms, and renal arterial dissections . Regarding the assessment of living renal transplant donors, CTA enables a highly accurate evaluation of the vascular anatomy . Although CTA is a reliable and noninvasive diagnostic tool, application of contrast medium is necessary and, with respect to contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI), can be problematic in case of renal impairment . The incidence of CI-AKI varies, depending on the definition of CI-AKI and contrast agents used, and is associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality, as well as an increased length of hospital stay and costs . Most patients sent for evaluation of renal disease have impaired renal function and also have, on average, become older and therefore have increased risk factors for CI-AKI. Thus, the constant risk of CI-AKI represents a significant problem in contemporary medical care and especially in radiological diagnostics of the kidneys. However, CI-AKI is dose dependent and can be reduced by decreasing the volume of contrast medium applied . Therefore, a CTA protocol that allows for substantial dose reduction would be desirable. The aim of the present study was to compare a new renal multiphase computed tomography angiography (MP-CTA) protocol with significantly reduced contrast volume with a standard renal CTA protocol.

## Materials and Methods

The present study was designed as a nonrandomized, retrospective, clinical cohort study. The study was authorized by the local ethics committee and all patients provided written informed consent. The control group consisted of subjects from the clinical database that underwent a standard renal CTA protocol. To guarantee comparability, the gender ratio of the control group was the same as in the study group. Furhtermore, the cutoffs regarding age, weight, and body mass index (BMI) were set below the maximum values of the study group.
