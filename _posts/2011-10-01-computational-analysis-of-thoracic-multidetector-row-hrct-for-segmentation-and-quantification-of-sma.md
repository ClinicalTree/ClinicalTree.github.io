## Rationale and Objectives

Obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes are related to variable combinations of emphysema and small-airway disease, the latter manifested as air trapping (AT) on imaging. The investigators propose a method to extract AT information quantitatively from thoracic multi–detector row high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), validated by pulmonary function testing (PFT) correlation.

## Materials and Methods

Seventeen patients with obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent HRCT and PFT within a 3-day interval were retrospectively identified. Thin-section volumetric HRCT in inspiration and expiration was registered and analyzed using custom-made software. Nonaerated regions of lung were segmented through exclusion of voxels > −50 Hounsfield units (HU); emphysematous areas were segmented as voxels < −950 HU on inspiratory images. Small-airway AT volume (ATV) was segmented as regions of lung voxels whose attenuation values increased by less than a specified change threshold (set from 5 to 300 HU in 25-HU increments) between inspiration and expiration. Inspiratory and expiratory total segmented lung volumes, emphysema volume (EV), and ATV for each threshold were subsequently calculated and correlated with PFT parameters.

## Results

A strong positive correlation was obtained between total segmented lung volume in inspiration and total lung capacity ( _r_ = 0.83). A strong negative correlation ( _r_ = −0.80) was obtained between EV and the ratio between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity. Stronger negative correlation with forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ( _r_ = −0.85) was demonstrated when ATV (threshold, 50 HU) was added to EV, indicating improved quantification of total AT to predict obstructive disease severity. A moderately strong positive correlation between ATV and residual volume was observed, with a maximum _r_ value of 0.72 (threshold, 25 HU), greater than that between EV and residual volume ( _r_ = 0.58). The benefit of ATV quantification was greater in a subgroup of patients with negligible emphysema compared to patients with moderate to severe emphysema.

## Conclusions

Small-airway AT segmentation in conjunction with emphysema segmentation through computer-assisted methodologies may provide better correlations with key PFT parameters, suggesting that the quantification of emphysema-related and small airway–related components of AT from thoracic HRCT has great potential to elucidate phenotypic differences in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Obstructive pulmonary disease is most often due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is a major global public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States and is anticipated to rank fifth in 2020 in burden of disease caused worldwide . Moreover, among the four major causes of mortality, namely, cardiovascular disease, malignant neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, and COPD, the last is the only one that has been steadily rising in prevalence .

COPD is defined as chronic, progressive airflow limitation that is not fully reversible, associated with a range of pathologic changes in the lungs with significant extrapulmonary effects, caused by chronic inflammation and structural changes . The chronic airflow limitation is caused by a mixture of small-airway disease (obstructive bronchiolitis) and parenchymal destruction (emphysema). The relative contributions of these two components vary substantially from patient to patient. The presence and extent of each component has the potential to affect clinical presentation, disease severity, prognosis, and therapeutic response .
