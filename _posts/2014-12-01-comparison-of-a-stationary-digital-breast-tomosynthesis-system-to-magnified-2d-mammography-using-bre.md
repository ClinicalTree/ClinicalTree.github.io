## Rational and Objectives

The objective of this study was to compare the stationary digital breast tomosynthesis (s-DBT) system to a conventional mammography system in a study of breast specimens. Radiologist evaluation of image quality was assessed in a reader study. This study represents the first human tissue imaging with the novel carbon nanotube–based s-DBT device.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty-nine patients, with known breast lesions (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 4 or 5) by conventional mammography and scheduled for needle localization biopsy, were recruited under an institutional review board–approved protocol. Specimen images were obtained using a two-dimensional (2D) mammography system with a ×1.8 magnification factor and an s-DBT system without a high magnification factor. A reader study was performed with four breast fellowship-trained radiologists over two separate sessions. Malignancy scores were recorded for both masses and microcalcifications (MCs). Reader preference between the two modalities for MCs, masses, and surgical margins was recorded.

## Results

The s-DBT system was found to be comparable to magnified 2D mammography for malignancy diagnosis. Readers preferred magnified 2D mammography for MC visualization ( _P_ < .05). However, readers trended toward a preference for s-DBT with respect to masses and surgical margin assessment.

## Conclusions

Here, we report on the first human data acquired using a stationary digital breast tomosynthesis system. The novel s-DBT system was found to be comparable to magnified 2D mammography imaging for malignancy diagnosis. Given the trend of preference for s-DBT over 2D mammography for both mass visibility and margin assessment, s-DBT could be a viable alternative to magnified 2D mammography for imaging breast specimens.

Malignant lesions in the breast can be difficult to visualize using full-field digital mammography (FFDM) when significant tissue overlap is present. Tissue overlap is most apparent in breast tissue that is thick and radiographically dense. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) uses a small number of angular projections to reconstruct a pseudo–three-dimensional (3D)volume. Recent studies have shown an increase in the area under the curve (AUC) when using a combination of DBT and FFDM compared to FFDM alone . Recall rates for benign cases significantly decrease when using a combination of DBT and FFDM . However, for cases with microcalcifications (MCs), the use of DBT along with an FFDM image has shown no significant improvement in the AUC .

Current DBT systems use a single X-ray source which is translated over an angular span that typically covers between 15° and 50° . Larger angular spans sample more of the Fourier domain which reduces out-of-plane reconstruction artifacts. Translating a source over a larger angular span requires longer acquisition times, which leads to patient motion artifacts . These single-source systems also suffer from poor spatial resolution because of focal spot blurring from the tube motion . We have developed a stationary digital breast tomosynthesis (s-DBT) technology that uses a novel multiple focal-spot X-ray source array with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the field emission electron source . This stationary approach can increase acquisition speed and eliminate the focal spot motion. It has been shown that the s-DBT device offers significant improvement in image quality, including improved modulation transfer function (MTF) and lesion conspicuity in breast phantom studies .
