## Rationale and Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare diagnostic accuracy between computed tomography (CT)–guided percutaneous cutting needle biopsy (PCNB) and surgery or open biopsy for thymic epithelial tumors in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and to evaluate computed tomographic diagnosis additionally.

## Materials and Methods

Subjects were 20 patients (11 men, 9 women) in whom CT, CT-guided PCNB, and surgery had been performed for anterior mediastinal tumors. All diagnoses of both CT-guided PCNB and surgery or open biopsy were made in accordance with the WHO classification. Computed tomographic diagnoses were performed by two radiologists on the basis of radiologic characteristics previously reported according to the simplified WHO classification (types A and AB, type B1, types B2 and B3, and thymic carcinoma). The concordance of the WHO classification or the simplified WHO classification between the diagnosis on either CT or CT-guided PCNB and that on surgery was evaluated using the weighted κ statistic.

## Results

The histologic classifications on the basis of surgical resection specimens were as follows: type A, _n_ = 3; type AB, _n_ = 5; type B1, _n_ = 3; type B2, _n_ = 4; type B3, _n_ = 4; and thymic carcinoma, _n_ = 1\. The overall concordance with the diagnosis according to the WHO classification established using CT-guided PCNB specimens (weighted κ = 0.757) was higher than that using computed tomographic diagnosis (weighted κ = 0.437).

## Conclusion

CT-guided PCNB is a technique with good concordance of the WHO classification of thymic epithelial tumors between the diagnoses of surgery or open biopsy.

In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a consensus classification of thymic epithelial tumors , which was revised in 2004 . It stratifies thymic epithelial tumors into six categories (types A, AB, B1, B2, and B3 and thymic carcinoma) on the basis of epithelial cell morphology and the lymphocyte/epithelial cell ratio. The WHO histologic classification reflects the clinical features of thymic epithelial tumors, and this system may contribute to the clinical assessment and treatment of patients with thymoma . Computed tomography (CT) is commonly used in biopsies to assist with precision guidance of the instruments necessary to perform the biopsies in the appropriate areas of the body. CT-guided biopsy is often preferred because most mediastinal tumors are located adjacent to major vessels and other important structures . Percutaneous cutting needle biopsy (PCNB) has become safer and more accurate by using larger, 18-gauge to 20-gauge needles , which allow sufficient tissue to be obtained for histologic examination and diagnosis of thymic epithelial tumor . However, to our knowledge, only a few studies have assessed the reliability of both CT and CT-guided PCNB for the diagnosis of thymic epithelial tumors according to the WHO classification. The aims of the present study were to compare diagnostic accuracy between CT-guided PCNB and surgery or open biopsy and also to evaluate computed tomographic image diagnosis by radiologists on the basis of previously reported computed tomographic features of thymic epithelial tumors in accordance with the WHO classification.

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

Subjects were 20 patients (11 men, 9 women; age range, 35–74 years; mean age, 61 years), in whom CT-guided PCNB had been performed for anterior mediastinal tumors between May 2000 and November 2006 and for whom definitive diagnoses of thymic epithelial tumors were established by surgical resection or open surgical biopsy. CT was performed in all patients prior to CT-guided PCNB. Computed tomographic images were obtained before and after contrast medium administration using 8-detector (LightSpeed Ultra; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI; _n_ = 14) and 64-detector (LightSpeed VCT; GE Healthcare; _n_ = 6) computed tomographic scanners. The ethics review boards of the institutions that contributed cases to this study did not require patients' approval or informed consent for the retrospective review of patient records and images.
