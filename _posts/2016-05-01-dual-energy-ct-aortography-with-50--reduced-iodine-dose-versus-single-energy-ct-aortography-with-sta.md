## Rationale and Objectives

Because many patients with aortic pathology also have compromised renal function, we wished to investigate dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) aortography with 50% reduced iodine dose compared to single-energy computed tomography (SECT) aortography with standard iodine dose.

## Materials and Methods

Fifty patients had DECT aortography with 50% reduced iodine dose. Thirty-four of these patients had prior SECT aortography with standard iodine dose. DECT images were reconstructed at both 50 and 77 keV and were compared to SECT 120 kVp images. Reviewers measured aortic attenuation, image noise, and scored vascular enhancement. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated. Volume CT dose index was recorded.

## Results

Mean iodine dose was 47 g for SECT and 24 g for DECT. Aortic attenuation was highest at reduced iodine dose DECT 50 keV (570 ± 105 Hounsfield units \[HU\]) compared to 77 keV (239 ± 40 HU) or to standard iodine dose SECT 120 kVp (356 ± 69 HU) ( _P_ < 0.05). Image noise was greatest at 50 keV compared to 77 keV and 120 kVp ( _P_ < 0.05) but was similar between 77 keV and 120 kVp ( _P_ > 0.05). SNR and CNR were the same at 50 keV and 120 kVp ( _P_ > 0.05). Mean vascular enhancement scores were all above 3.0 (good, typical enhancement). Volume CT dose index was 11.7 mGy for DECT and 11.8 mGy for SECT ( _P_ = 0.37).

## Conclusions

DECT aortography with 50% reduced iodine reconstructed at 50 keV resulted in significantly greater aortic attenuation, good subjective vascular enhancement, and comparable SNR and CNR compared to standard iodine dose SECT. DECT image noise at 77 keV was similar to SECT at 120 kVp.

## Introduction

Patients with compromised renal function may be at increased risk for iodinated contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) from computed tomography (CT) aortography. Some authors have proposed that the size of this risk is related to the size of the dose of intravenous iodine . For this reason, a CT aortography technique that substantially reduced the dose of iodine without compromising vascular enhancement might be advantageous.

Dual-energy CT (DECT) enables reconstruction of monochromatic synthetic images at lower energies, which may support iodine dose reduction. Because the x-ray absorption of iodine increases near its k-edge (33.2 keV), DECT images displayed at lower monochromatic energies have substantially increased intravascular attenuation. As a result, DECT aortography performed with a reduced iodine dose and reconstructed at lower monochromatic energies (40–50 keV) may result in intravascular attenuation that is similar to that seen in standard iodine dose single-energy CT (SECT) aortography with 120 kVp polychromatic images. However, with DECT at lower monochromatic energies, overall image noise increases. To compensate, DECT images may also be reconstructed from the same data set at higher monochromatic energies (77 keV) resulting in much less image noise. These additional higher energy DECT images may improve viewing of nonvascular anatomy because the noise levels may be comparable to the noise in standard 120 kVp SECT aortography.
