## Highlights

- Artifacts by cardiac arrhythmias often hinder radiological evaluation in cardiac CT.

- RIMM technique (RIF in motion mapping) considerably eliminates artifacts.

- This enhanced visualization by RIMM precludes further invasive diagnostic procedures.


## Rationale and Objectives

Particularly for patients with heart arrhythmias, conventional BestSystole (BS) and BestDiastole (BD) reconstruction techniques in computed tomography (CT) frequently show artifacts that hinder the readability of the coronary tree. To address this problem, this paper presents an alternative reconstruction method that combines the technique “reconstructions with identical filling” (RIF) with motion mapping: This new technique is called “RIF in motion mapping” (RIMM). This study compares the diagnostic quality of images generated with RIMM to that of the other reconstruction techniques.

TABLE 1


Likert Scale Was Used for Stratifying Image Quality Into Non-diagnostic (Likert 1 and 2) and Diagnostic Datasets (Likert 3–5)


Likert Value Interpretation 0 Segment anatomically not existing 1 Non-diagnostic image quality Segment existing due to reference (conventional coronary angiography (CCA) or cCTA), but not identifiable because of severe artifacts 2 Segment existing and identifiable, but not evaluable due to artifacts, representing image with non-diagnostic quality. 3 Diagnostic image quality Moderate image quality: vessel wall and plaques adequately defined, artifacts not influencing diagnostic performance 4 Good image quality: vessel wall and plaques well but not entirely sharply defined; minor artifacts allowed 5 Excellent image quality: vessel wall and plaques sharply delineated; no artifacts

cCTA, coronary computed tomography angiography.
