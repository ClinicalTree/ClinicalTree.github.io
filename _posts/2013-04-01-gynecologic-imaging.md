This first-edition text serves as an outstanding, comprehensive review of gynecologic imaging for both radiologists and nonradiology clinicians. This book thoroughly (yet concisely) presents the normal anatomy, imaging of benign and malignant disease, and current management guidelines.

The text is divided into 10 sections: imaging techniques/anatomy, pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding, infertility, first-trimester pregnancy complications, postpartum complications, adnexal masses, gynecologic cancer, pediatric imaging, and interventional radiology in gynecology. The current American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria for gynecologic imaging are included in a brief appendix.

The opening section on imaging techniques and anatomy is separated into chapters by imaging modality, which optimizes its utility as a reading room resource. This excellent overview of the various modalities includes high-yield description of common pitfalls with each of these techniques.

The chapters in the remaining nine sections adhere to an easy-to-follow format consisting of definitions, epidemiology, clinical presentation, imaging, differential diagnosis, treatment, reporting, key points, references, and suggested readings. The images are of excellent quality, well annotated, and in color when appropriate. The authors successfully selected images that best illustrate each disease entity and complement the text.

This comprehensive review is an excellent resource for medical students, radiology trainees, general radiologists, and gynecologists who wish to learn more about gynecologic imaging. The high quality of the writing, images, and overall organization facilitate its on-the-fly use in both the reading room and clinic.
