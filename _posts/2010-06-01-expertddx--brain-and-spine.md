AMIRSYS's installment in the _EXPERTddx_ series on the brain and spine is typical of this series: impressive, well organized, appropriately detailed, and very well illustrated. The organization of this tome is logical, but I would have preferred if brain and spine had been split into separate books. As it is, the book is probably better suited as a reference tool (desk, library, reading room, etc) rather than carrying it around in a bag on a daily basis. I found the page-numbering system slightly curious, but it was quite functional nonetheless. The book was easy to read, despite its structure as a bullet-point outline. This may be due to the outstanding illustrations, which are organized in a fashion that allows the reader to look across several related diagnoses with related images, setting up an instant “compare and contrast.” This really added to the flow of the book, at least in my opinion. This was a welcome revelation in such an impressive reference tool as this. Online access to additional materials seems like a nice bonus, especially to complement the large size of the book.
