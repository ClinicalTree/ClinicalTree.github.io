## Rationale and Objectives

To assess associations between screening mammography utilization and Medicare beneficiaries' relationships with, and impressions of, their primary care physicians.

## Materials and Methods

Using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Access to Care Public Use File, we retrospectively studied responses from a national random cross section of Medicare beneficiaries surveyed in 2013 regarding perceptions of their primary care physicians and their screening mammography utilization. Statistical analysis accounted for subject weighting factors to estimate national screening utilization.

## Results

Among 7492 female Medicare beneficiaries, 62.0% (95% confidence interval 59.8%–64.2%) underwent screening mammography. Utilization was higher for beneficiaries having (vs. not) a regular medical practice or clinic (63.2% vs. 34.6%) and a usual physician (63.8% vs. 50.3%). Utilization was higher for beneficiaries very satisfied (vs. very dissatisfied) with the overall quality of care they received (66.0% vs. 35.8%), their ease of getting to a doctor (67.7% vs. 43.2%), and their physician's concerns for their health (65.7% vs. 53.4%), as well as for beneficiaries strongly agreeing (vs. strongly disagreeing) that their physician is competent (66.0% vs. 54.1%), understands what is wrong (66.3% vs. 47.1%), answers all questions (67.0% vs. 46.7%), and fosters confidence (66.0% vs. 50.6%). Independent predictors of screening mammography utilization ( _P_ < .05) were satisfaction with quality of care, having a regular practice or clinic, and satisfaction with ease of getting to their physician.

## Conclusions

Screening mammography utilization is higher among Medicare beneficiaries with established primary physician relationships, particularly when those relationships are favorable. To optimize screening mammography utilization, breast imagers are encouraged to support initiatives to enhance high-quality primary care relationships.

## Introduction

Although screening mammography has been shown to be important for early detection of breast cancer and reduction of mortality , women's utilization of mammography is highly variable . Past studies have demonstrated such utilization to be associated, for example, with women's age, race, ethnicity, English language proficiency, insurance coverage, and geographic proximity to screening facilities . Breast imagers have thus been enc ouraged to pursue initiatives to promote improved screening adherence, including automated reminders, patient navigators, and educational community outreach sessions . To be maximally effective, however, such programs must be designed with an understanding of a radiology practice's patient population, including particular patient risk factors for reduced screening compliance . Attention to such issues will be increasingly important for radiology practices as screening rates are being applied as a quality metric in existing and new federal programs for assessing the performance of physicians and their health system clinical partners .

In considering factors impacting screening adherence, prior studies have explored women's perceptions of the screening mammography experience, including not only the process of actually undergoing the mammogram, but also aspects of the facility, its staff, as well as the breast imager . Insights from such studies have been useful for breast imagers in better understanding how to optimize the patient experience in mammography so as to improve screening rates . However, with increasing health system merger and integration, most radiologists (including breast imagers) now increasingly find themselves parts of larger health networks and thus in positions to consider a broader array of practice- and provider-related factors . In particular, women's likelihood of undergoing screening may be influenced not only by their interactions with, and perceptions of, the physicians interpreting those screening tests, but also interactions and perceptions relating to the physicians ordering such tests in the first place. Indeed, earlier preliminary studies suggest associations between women's satisfaction with their primary care providers and screening rates . Nonetheless, larger population-based studies are necessary to validate and further understand such observations. In this study, we assess associations between women's utilization of screening mammography and relationships with, and impressions of, their primary care physicians within the Medicare population.
