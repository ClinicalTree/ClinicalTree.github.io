This book is a revised translation of the German edition: _MRT von Abdomen und Becken_ , written by authors with tremendous experience in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis. The organization and the context of this book reflect this experience and knowledge.

This book is organized into 17 chapters by organ system, with special chapters dedicated to: The Bile and Pancreatic Ducts, The Rectum and Anal Canal, The Retroperitoneum, The Prostate and Seminal Vesicles, Magnetic Resonance Pelvimetry, Magnetic Resonance Angiography of the Abdomen, Intra-abdominal Lymph Nodes, and Abdominal MRI in Children. The chapters are well-organized into sections including indications, imaging technique, appearance of normal anatomy, and appearance of pathologic entities. Additional sections are dedicated to discussion of special topicsâ€”for example, specific coils for improved imaging (endorectal coil for the prostate) and specific contrast (tissue specific biliary contrast).

The book is particularly helpful for the radiologists in understanding the basic principles of MRI and tissue characteristics of the abdomen and pelvis. This is further complemented by an excellent discussion of protocols and contrast media, without being too technically detailed and distracting. The book is a great resource whether you are in training and want to learn the principles behind abdomen and pelvis protocols or you are a practicing radiologist who wants to revise currents protocols and explore a new imaging technique. The book is also a great reference for oncologic imaging because it details utility of imaging and staging criteria and provides excellent radiographic examples.

The book does not mislead the reader into believing that MRI is for every situation. The authors have approached the book with everyday practice in mind. Utility of MRI in each disease process and organ system is discussed and compared with other modalities.

Most important, the quality of the images provided is exemplary! The depth of discussion in the sections was very appropriate for radiology residents, fellows, general practice radiologists, and subspecialists. The book can be used as a learning tool for residents and as a great reference for fellows and practicing radiologists.
