## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to develop a new technique, the use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) to monitor gene/MR–cotransferred stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) recruited to atherosclerosis.

## Materials and Methods

First, a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene and a T1 MR contrast agent (motexafin gadolinium \[MGd\]) were cotransferred into neural or bone marrow (BM)–derived SPCs. GFP expression and MGd signal were confirmed by fluorescent microscopy and quantified by flow cytometry. Cell viability and proliferation were then evaluated by trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay, and GFP/MGd–transferred cells were imaged using 1.5-T and 9.4-T MR scanners. For in vivo validation, GFP/MGd–cotransferred β-galactosidase–BM SPCs were transplanted to apolipoprotein E–knockout mice, and cell migration to atherosclerotic aortas was monitored using 9.4-T micro-MRI with subsequent histologic correlations.

## Results

Fluorescent microscopy demonstrated simultaneous GFP expression and MGd signals in cotransferred-cells. Quantitative flow cytometry showed GFP-positive cells at 47 ± 25% and 56 ± 12% and MGd-positive cells at 96 ± 6% and 57 ± 11% for neural stem cells and BM cells, respectively. Cell viability and metabolic rates of cotransferred cells were 86 ± 4% and 84 ± 12%, respectively. In vivo MRI revealed high MR signals of the aortic walls in GFP/MGd–transferred mice, which were confirmed by histologic correlations.

## Conclusion

This study has initially proven the new concept of MRI for plaque-specific, cell-mediated gene expression of atherosclerosis.

A characteristic feature of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is its diffuse involvement of arteries across the entire human body and the presence of multiple and simultaneous atherosclerotic lesions. Endovascular interventional procedures, such as balloon angioplasty and stenting, are currently used as routine “local” treatments of atherosclerotic arteries. However, these local interventional approaches do not treat multiple diffuse atherosclerosis. Thus, it is essential to seek alternatives to treat all atherosclerotic arteries at once.

Hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (SPC) can give rise to vascular progenitor cells that migrate or home to atherosclerotic arteries and differentiate into either smooth-muscle cells or endothelial cells . Intravenously transfused hematopoietic SPCs circulate in the blood system, flow through the entire body, and thus home to all atherosclerotic lesions. Gene therapy is an exciting frontier in cardiovascular medicine . The transfer of therapeutic genes into hematopoietic SPCs prior to their transplantation to the body may enable the SPC-mediated plaque-specific delivery of therapeutic genes to diffuse multiple atherosclerotic lesions.

![Figure 4, (a) Representative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)–histology correlation. From top, a normal mouse and three apolipoprotein E–knockout mice with no cell transplantation (CT), green fluorescent protein (GFP) CT, and GFP/motexafin gadolinium (MGd) CT. In vivo 9.4-T MRI shows MGd-enhanced portions (P, arrow) of the ascending aortic wall with GFP/MGd CT, which are not seen in three control aortas (A,F,K). Histology with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining shows a normal aorta (B) and atherosclerotic aortas with plaques (P) in all apoE −/− mice (G,L,Q). In the normal control aorta and the apoE −/− control aorta (with no CT), histology confirmed no GFP-positive, MGd-positive, or β-galactosidase (LacZ)–positive cells (C–E and H–J). However, in the aorta treated with GFP cells, GFP-positive (M, arrows) and LacZ-positive cells (O, blue spots) are detected. In the aorta with GFP/MGd CT, histology detects GFP-positive and MGd-positive cells (R,S, arrows), as well as LacZ-positive cells (T, blue spots). Magnification 20×. (b) Comparison of average MR signal intensities of aortic walls between four different animal groups with various treatments. The MGd-created MR signal intensity ratio is significantly higher in the animal group with transplantation of GFP/MGd–transferred cells than in other three control animal groups. m, media. ∗ P < .05.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/DualTransferofGFPGeneandMGdintoStemProgenitorCells/3_1s20S107663321000111X.jpg)
