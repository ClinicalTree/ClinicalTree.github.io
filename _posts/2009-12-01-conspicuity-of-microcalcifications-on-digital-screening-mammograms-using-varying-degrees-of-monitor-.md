## Rationale and Objectives

American College of Radiology guidelines suggest that digital screening mammographic images should be viewed at the full resolution at which they were acquired. This slows interpretation speed. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of various levels of zooming on the detection and conspicuity of microcalcifications.

## Materials and Methods

Six radiologists viewed 40 mammographic images five times in different random orders using five different levels of zooming: full resolution (100%) and 30%, 61%, 88%, and 126% of that size. Thirty-three images contained microcalcifications varying in subtlety, all associated with breast cancer. The clusters were circled. Seven images contained no malignant calcifications but also had randomly placed circles. The radiologists graded the presence or absence and visual conspicuity of any calcifications compared to calcifications in a reference image. They also counted the microcalcifications.

## Results

The radiologists saw the microcalcifications in 94% of the images at 30% size and in either 99% or 100% of the other tested levels of zooming. Conspicuity ratings were worst for the 30% size and fairly similar for the others. Using the 30% size, two radiologists failed to see the microcalcifications on either the craniocaudal or mediolateral oblique view taken from one patient. Interobserver agreement regarding the number of calcifications was lowest for the 30% images and second lowest for the 100% images.

## Conclusions

Images at 30% size should not be relied on alone for systematic scanning for microcalcifications. The other four levels of magnification all performed well enough to warrant further testing.

In 2007 the American College of Radiology promulgated recommendations that all digital screening mammograms should be viewed at the full resolution at which they were acquired. To do this, images must be zoomed so that they are physically larger than the area of the 5-megapixel monitors on which they are typically viewed. This zooming contributes to a near doubling of the time needed to interpret digital screening mammograms compared to film-screen screening mammograms . That increase in interpretation time may contribute to a relatively slow penetration of digital imaging into mammography, compared to its acceptance in other areas of radiology. We have studied the effect of varying degrees of image zooming on the visual conspicuity of microcalcifications present on digital screening mammograms to determine the contribution of zooming to the detection of microcalcifications and to guide our choice of levels of zooming to be tested in a subsequent trial. Eventually, we intend to study the effect of zooming on the detection of other signs of breast cancer, particularly masses. Because malignant microcalcifications are often small and subtle, any degradation of resolution caused by rebinning might have a greater impact on their detection than on the detection of masses. Therefore, we have first tested microcalcifications.

## Materials and methods

This study was granted exemption by our institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent regarding patients whose images were used as part of the study was waived. Verbal consent to participate was deemed adequate for radiologists who agreed to take part as readers.

## Setting for the Experiment

![Figure 2, Photograph of the monitor pair demonstrates the setup used for testing the four-on-one display mode. The poster board masks the entire monitor on the reader's right and the part of the left monitor displaying any images not being tested. If the tested image was an image other than the right craniocaudal view, the observer positioned the image being tested in the exposed part of the monitor before directing the reader's attention to the image. When the fit-screen, partway, 100%, or slightly larger display mode was tested, the mask on the left monitor was changed to a thin strip of poster board across the top that masked the patient's identifying information.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ConspicuityofMicrocalcificationsonDigitalScreeningMammogramsUsingVaryingDegreesofMonitorZooming/1_1s20S1076633209004085.jpg)

To allow for the several variables, such as differing readers, Bonferroni's adjustment was used. This meant that the cutoff for significance was _P_ < .005 rather than the more usual cutoff of _P_ < .05.
