## Rationale and Objective

Patients with ulcerative colitis require recurrent conventional colonoscopy (CC) to define the extent of the disease. Computed tomography (CT) colonography (CTC) can be used as an alternative technique for studying the colon in these patients. The purpose of the study was to compare the findings of CTC to CC in patients with ulcerative colitis.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty patients proven to have ulcerative colitis on biopsy and in clinical remission state were enrolled in the study. They underwent CTC and CC within 1 week of each test. The investigators performing CTC and CC were blinded to the findings of each other. The chi-square test, kappa test, sensitivity, and specificity were used to compare the findings on CTC and CC. In addition, patient acceptance for both the procedures was compared.

## Results

Sensitivity and specificity on CTC for detecting granular appearance were 81.0% and 73.8%, respectively, and for pseudopolyps were 82.1% and 84.5%, respectively. Good correlation was seen between CTC and CC for detection of granular appearance and pseudopolyps. Loss of haustral folds, wall thickening, pericolonic vascularity, and pericolonic lymph nodes seen on CTC were found to correlate with intraluminal findings seen on CC. Patient acceptance for CTC was better than that for CC.

## Conclusions

CTC can be used for evaluating patients with ulcerative colitis who are in remission.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the bowel of unknown etiology . Patients with ulcerative colitis require recurrent conventional colonoscopy (CC) to define the extent of the disease, to reconfirm the validity of diagnosis, and for cancer surveillance. Computed tomography (CT) colonography (CTC) can be used as an alternative technique for studying the colon. In this technique, volumetric data obtained by high-resolution helical CT are analyzed using specialized computer software to generate virtual colonoscopic images . Its advantage over CC includes its less-invasive nature, ability to visualize the entire colon, absence of blind areas, and evaluation of extracolonic pathology. It allows simultaneous assessment of colonic mucosal surface, wall thickness, surrounding structures, local lymphadenopathy, fistulae, and evaluation of proximal colon in patients with obstructive stricture. CTC is able to identify endoluminal, intramural, and extracolonic findings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in English literature which evaluates the use of 64-slice CTC in patients with ulcerative colitis. The correlation between CTC and CC for granular appearance and pseudopolyps has been evaluated in this study.

## Materials and methods

Twenty consecutive patients of either sex, presenting to the Gastroenterology Department, proven to have ulcerative colitis on colonoscopic or sigmoidoscopic biopsy, and presently in clinically remission state, were enrolled in the study. The institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol, and an informed consent was obtained from each patient. Exclusion criteria included 1) age <18 years, 2) patients having active ulcerative colitis, and 3) allergy from contrast media. Three days before CTC, patients were asked to eat food with low fiber content. Patients were given wet preparation. Wet preparation included two packets of polyethylene glycol electrolyte solution (Peglec; Tablets Limited) dissolved in 2 L of water, given 12 hours before the study. Forty milliliters of 76% Diatrizoate Megulamine & Diatrizoate Sodium iodinated contrast (Trazograf 76%; Unique pharmaceuticals) was added to the Peglec solution, for the effective differentiation of fecal material from polyps. To achieve adequate bowel distention during CTC, injection hyoscine N-butylbromide (Buscopan; German Remedies Limited) 20 mg was given intravenously to all patients, who did not have history of glaucoma or urinary retention due to high-grade prostate enlargement.
