## Rationale and Objectives

This study is conducted to estimate the sensitivity of stereotactic directional vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (ST DVAB) using Bayesian modeling and to predict how many more cancers can be inferred from those lesions without surgical correlation.

## Materials and methods

We retrospectively reviewed the 103 lesions from 84 women who underwent ST DVAB. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. We estimated the sensitivity and prevalence of the study population for ST DVAB by two types of approaches: for the type I approach, the gold standards were surgical correlation or postbiopsy mammographic follow-up. For the type II approach using Bayesian modeling by a beta-binomial model, the only gold standard was surgical correlation and the predicted number of cancerous lesions in those patients without surgical correlation was estimated.

## Results

For the type I approach, the sensitivity was 92.3%, and the prevalence 12.6%. For the type II approach, the mean sensitivity of ST DVAB was 89%, and the mean prevalence was 15%. We predicted that an average of 1.7 cancerous lesions occurred among those lesions without surgical correlation by the Bayesian estimation.

## Conclusions

The mean sensitivity of ST DVAB using the Bayesian (type II) approach was lower than that using the type I approach, because we regarded the surgery as the only gold standard in Bayesian modeling and the nonoperated lesions were thought to be with unknown true disease status. The Bayesian approach is thus more appropriate to use than the type I approach when the gold standard is incomplete.

Stereotactic directional vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (ST DVAB) is the standard biopsy method for mammographically visible lesions of a suspicious nature, because it has high sensitivity diagnosing breast carcinoma, according to many reported studies . When ST DVAB yields benign pathology concordant with mammographic findings, mammographic follow-up is the recommended management . The lesions are presumed benign if the postbiopsy findings are unchanged for at least 2 years on mammography . However, for lesions showing benign result on ST biopsy, an inherent missed diagnosis is possible with the false-negative (FN) rate ranging from 1.2% to 4.3% . However, for most clinical settings, the sensitivity of ST DVAB was estimated from patients who undergo subsequent surgery or regular mammographic follow-up and is defined as the cancers disclosed by ST DVAB divided by cancers by ST DVAB and subsequent surgery, which did not consider the possible FN lesions in those who received only mammographic follow-up but without surgical correlation. The true disease status of these presumably benign lesions may not be known. Therefore, ST DVAB can be thought as an accurate biopsy method, but may not be regarded as the gold standard for tissue proof, when compared with surgery.

In the literature, Bayesian modeling has been used to estimate the diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity when the gold standard is incomplete and available for only part of the population or not available at all . We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the sensitivity of ST DVAB on the basis of the information for all lesions with or without known true disease status (that is, surgical correlation), and to estimate how many of the nonoperated ST DVAB findings could be inherent cancers when the stricter standard was applied using Bayesian modeling.
