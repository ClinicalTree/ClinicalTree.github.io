## Rationale and Objectives

Evidence-based treatment and management for patients with bronchiectasis remain challenging. There is a need for regional disease measurements as focal distribution of disease is common. Our objective was to evaluate the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect regional ventilation impairment and response to airway clearance therapy (ACT) in patients with noncystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis, providing a new way to objectively and regionally evaluate response to therapy.

## Materials and Methods

Fifteen participants with non-CF bronchiectasis and 15 age-matched healthy volunteers provided written informed consent to an ethics board-approved Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant protocol and underwent spirometry, plethysmography, computed tomography (CT), and hyperpolarized  3 He MRI. Bronchiectasis patients also completed a Six-Minute Walk Test, the St. George's Respiratory questionnaire, and Patient Evaluation Questionnaire (PEQ), and returned for a follow-up visit after 3 weeks of daily oscillatory positive expiratory pressure use. CT evidence of bronchiectasis was qualitatively reported by lobe, and MRI ventilation defect percent (VDP) was measured for the entire lung and individual lobes.

## Results

CT evidence of bronchiectasis and abnormal VDP (14 ± 7%) was observed for all bronchiectasis patients and no healthy volunteers. There was CT evidence of bronchiectasis in all lobes for 3 patients and in 3 ± 1 lobes (range = 1–4) for 12 patients. VDP in lobes with CT evidence of bronchiectasis (19 ± 12%) was significantly higher than in lobes without CT evidence of bronchiectasis (8 ± 5%, _P_ = .001). For patients, VDP in lung lobes with ( _P_ < .0001) and without CT evidence of bronchiectasis ( _P_ = .006) was higher than in healthy volunteers (3 ± 1%). For all patients, mean PEQ-ease-bringing-up-sputum ( _P_ = .048) and PEQ-patient-global-assessment ( _P_ = .01) were significantly improved post-oscillatory positive expiratory pressure. An improvement in regional VDP greater than the minimum clinical important difference was observed for 8 of the 14 patients evaluated.

## Conclusions

There was CT and MRI evidence of structure-function abnormalities in patients with bronchiectasis; in approximately half, there was evidence of ventilation improvements after airway clearance therapy.

## Introduction

Bronchiectasis, a chronic airway disease, is characterized by irreversible dilation of the airways leading to pooling and poor clearance of mucus in affected regions . There is considerable overlap betweenbronchiectasis and other chronic airway diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In fact, up to 50% of patients with COPD have associated bronchiectasis and these patients have higher rates of exacerbation and worse outcomes . The increasing prevalence and clinical impact of bronchiectasis are now recognized due to their significant burden on patients of all ages and on global healthcare costs.

Evidence-based treatment and management for patients with bronchiectasis remain very challenging. The overall goal of treatment is to improve quality of life by reducing cough, sputum volume, sputum purulence, and the number of chest infections. Unfortunately, despite the increasing number of randomized controlled trials in recent years, currently there are no pharmacological treatments approved, and clinical trials struggle to achieve enrollment targets and demonstrate treatment effects . Despite these challenges, numerous antibiotics, mucoactive therapies, anti-inflammatory agents, and chest physiotherapy are currently under investigation . Regional disease measurements may be particularly important in bronchiectasis because focal distribution of disease is quite common. For example, idiopathic bronchiectasis often affects the lower lobes, immotile cilia syndrome has a right middle lobe, and lingula predominance and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis typically present centrally . Because of this, evidence-based treatments for patients with bronchiectasis will become increasingly dependent on sensitive, objective, and regional markers of lung function in proof-of-concept trials.
