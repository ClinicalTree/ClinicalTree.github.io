## Rationale and Objectives

To retrospectively investigate the prevalence of tracheal collapse in an emphysema cohort. The occurrence of a large degree of tracheal collapse may have important implications for the clinical management of respiratory symptoms and air trapping in patients with emphysema.

## Materials and Methods

Paired full-inspiratory and end-expiratory thin-section volumetric computed tomographic scans were available for 1071 long-term smokers with clinically and physiologically confirmed emphysema. The percentage reduction in the cross-sectional tracheal luminal area from full-inspiration to end-expiration was automatically computed at 2.5-mm intervals along the centerline of the trachea using customized software.

## Results

Maximal tracheal collapse did not follow a normal distribution in the emphysema cohort ( _P_ < .0001, skewness/kurtosis tests for normality); the median collapse was 18% (intraquartile range, 11%–30%). Statistically significant differences were found in the distribution of maximal collapse by gender ( _P_ < .005, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Overall, 10.5% of men and 17.1% of women showed evidence of tracheomalacia on the basis of the criterion of a reduction of 50% or greater in cross-sectional tracheal luminal area at end-expiration.

## Conclusion

This study offers insights into the prevalence of tracheal collapse in a cohort of patients with emphysema; future work is needed to determine the possible relationship between tracheal collapse and air trapping in subjects with emphysema.

A high degree of tracheal collapse is associated with tracheomalacia, which can be diagnosed in both children and adults ( ). Tracheomalacia can be congenital or acquired; associated symptoms include dyspnea, wheeze, cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis. Investigators have suggested a correlation between tracheobronchomalacia and chronic inflammation and irritants, such as cigarette smoke ( ). Because of its nonspecific symptoms, it may be an underdiagnosed condition.

Bronchoscopy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing tracheobronchomalacia ( ); a reduction in the cross-sectional luminal area of the trachea greater than 50% is considered indicative of tracheomalacia. The reported prevalence of the disease has ranged from 1% to 13% for all subjects referred for bronchoscopic evaluation ( ) and as high as 23% for subjects with histories of chronic bronchitis ( ). The condition is commonly associated with increased age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( ).
