## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to assess the role of diffusion-weighted imaging in predicting progression-free survival in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with induction chemotherapy.

## Materials and Methods

Eighteen patients with HNSCC underwent diffusion-weighted imaging studies prior to treatment and within 3 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy. Median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were computed from the largest cervical metastatic lymph node. Percentage changes in ADC values from pretreatment to posttreatment time points were compared between alive and dead patients using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test. _P_ values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

## Results

A 22% increase in ADC was observed after induction chemotherapy in alive patients ( _n_ = 15), while patients who died from HNSCC ( _n_ = 3) demonstrated a 33% decrease in ADC. The difference in percentage change in ADC between alive and dead patients was significant ( _P_ = .039).

## Conclusions

ADC may be a useful marker in predicting progression-free survival in patients with HNSCC undergoing induction chemotherapy.

Neoadjuvant induction chemotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has resulted in a decline in the risk for distant metastasis and an upsurge in organ preservation . In general, patients responsive to induction chemotherapy also demonstrate positive responses to subsequent radiotherapy . However, given the economic burden and toxic side effects associated with induction chemotherapy in patients with HNSCC , imaging biomarkers that can evaluate treatment and survival outcomes in assessing the efficacy of induction chemotherapy are desirable.

Several physiologic imaging modalities, such as 2-\[  18 F\]- fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) , computed tomographic perfusion imaging , proton and phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy , and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) , have been proposed for predicting and monitoring treatment response as well as predicting survival outcomes in patients with HNSCC undergoing concurrent chemoradiation therapy and surgery. However, lower spatial resolution and specificity associated with FDG-PET, technical limitations associated with performing magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and rigorous steps involved in the analysis of computed tomographic perfusion and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data limit the use of these modalities in the routine clinical settings. On the contrary, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which provides maps of microscopic water motion within biologic tissues, offers a more simplistic approach to ascertain physiologic changes within the tumor after treatment. Moreover, relative ease of data acquisition and availability of data processing tools for computing the magnitude of microscopic motion on routine clinical scanners make DWI a more suitable choice.
