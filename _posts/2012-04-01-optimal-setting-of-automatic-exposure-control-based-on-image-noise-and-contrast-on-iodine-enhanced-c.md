## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate variations in image noise and contrast using automatic exposure control (AEC) and different tube voltages on nonenhanced and iodine-enhanced hepatic computed tomography.

## Materials and Methods

Nonenhanced and iodine-enhanced simulated liver phantoms and AEC were used. Tube current was automatically adjusted with the noise index. Two types of assessments were performed: at a fixed noise index of 10 Hounsfield units and at different noise indexes, keeping the same contrast-to-noise ratio at different tube voltages (100, 120, and 130 kV). Image noise was measured, and contrast between the computed tomographic number of the simulated liver and nodule was computed.

## Results

At a fixed noise index, image noise on iodine-enhanced images was 10% to 13% higher than on nonenhanced images at the same tube voltage. At 130 and 100 kV, contrast was 33.86 and 46.90 Hounsfield units, respectively, and image noise was almost the same. Contrast-to-noise ratios at 100, 120, and 130 kV were 3.31, 3.22, and 3.37, respectively, and volume computed tomographic dose index fell from 22.94 to 12.49 mGy with decreasing tube voltage.

## Conclusions

With AEC, image noise on iodine-enhanced images was higher than on nonenhanced images despite identical noise index settings. As tube voltage decreased, contrast on iodine-enhanced images increased. Considering noise index and contrast variations at different tube voltages, the optimal use of AEC on iodine-enhanced computed tomography facilitates a reduction in x-ray tube output while maintaining contrast-to-noise ratio.

Automatic exposure control (AEC) adjusts tube current according to the size and attenuation of the body region being scanned to obtain constant image quality with lower radiation dose . With AEC, computed tomographic (CT) projection radiographs (scanograms) obtained from either the anteroposterior or lateral direction are used to estimate patient-specific attenuations , and these values are then applied to calculate the necessary tube current for each projection to maintain image noise and decrease x-ray tube output. The noise index is determined from the nonenhanced projection radiograph for both iodine-enhanced and nonenhanced scans. However, x-ray absorption is different in scan areas that do or do not contain iodinated enhancing material . Therefore, image noise on iodine-enhanced CT images is higher than on nonenhanced images when the same x-ray tube output is applied. This may lead to the deterioration of image quality. In addition, contrast between the human liver and a nodule increases with decreasing tube voltage because of the effect of iodine attenuation . Because the mean photon energy moves closer to the k-absorption edge of iodine, the photoelectric effect is increased, and Compton scattering is decreased; consequently, the mean attenuation value of iodine is increased . Kalra et al stated that low-contrast areas on abdominal studies are severely affected by an increase in image noise. They also suggested that the effect of tube voltage on image quality is complex and affects both image noise and contrast. Therefore, it is important to properly regulate the setting of the noise index on AEC on iodine-enhanced or nonenhanced scanning while maintaining desired image quality. Yu et al documented variations in image quality under iodine-enhanced CT protocols with AEC. These were due to changes in phantom size or in tube voltage. However, they did not discuss attenuation in organ iodine enhancement. Not only the enhancement of nodules but also that of organs must be considered in simulation studies of iodine enhancement.

The purpose of our study was to quantitatively evaluate image quality in terms of image noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and to provide iodine-enhanced CT protocols for optimizing x-ray tube output with AEC. We produced iodine-enhanced and nonenhanced liver phantoms that included a simulated nodule to mimic plain and arterial-phase hepatic CT scans and investigated variations in image noise and contrast. We applied AEC at different tube voltages on nonenhanced and iodine-enhanced hepatic computed tomography to identify optimal image noise settings.
