## Rationale and Objectives

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) provides information that can be used to estimate the symptom onset in patients with wake-up stroke (WUS). Time-resolved MR angiography (MRA) is the fastest available MR sequence technique for vessel assessment, and the different phases acquired can provide information about cerebral perfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of time-resolved MRA both for the assessment of vessel morphology and for the feasibility of perfusion.

## Materials and Methods

Nineteen patients with WUS were included. Image quality and vessel pathologies were evaluated and correlated to time-of-flight–MRA ( _n_ = 14), computed tomography–angiography ( _n_ = 4), sonography ( _n_ = 12), and conventional angiography ( _n_ = 6). The temporal delay of signal enhancement in all pixels of the time-resolved MRA measurement after contrast injection was evaluated and compared to dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion imaging ( _n_ = 13).

## Results

Time-resolved MRA resulted in the diagnosis of large vessel disease in 14 of 19 patients, involving the internal carotids ( _n_ = 4), the vertebral arteries ( _n_ = 3), and the circle of Willis ( _n_ = 10). All severe vascular pathologies which influence patients' acute stroke therapy were obtained by time-resolved MRA. Overestimation of stenoses in two of 14 patients resulted in sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 71%, respectively. Time-to-peak (TTP) estimations were hampered by movement artifacts in four patients (31%). Compared to DSC, the area of TTP delay was comparable in size and localization without relevant overestimation or underestimation.

## Conclusions

Time-resolved MRA is a valuable technique in patients with WUS with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value. Cerebral perfusion estimation can be performed in selected cases for therapy decision but can be hampered by patient movement.

Noncontrast brain computed tomography (CT) is considered the first line of imaging in patients with suspected acute stroke because of its broad availability and acquisition speed. Because intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is the most important therapy for acute ischemic stroke, any contraindications—notably intracranial hemorrhage—have to be ruled out as fast as possible before starting thrombolytic therapy. Noncontrast CT is often combined with CT-angiography (CTA) and CT-perfusion (CTP) imaging to evaluate the underlying stroke cause. Recent technological advances have contributed to more widespread use of new neuroimaging modalities and strategies such as diffusion-weighted (DWI) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI), cerebral perfusion imaging, and MR angiography. Although DWI is only available in MRI, perfusion imaging and angiography are available in both CT and MRI, which can be beneficial to patient evaluation and management in special cases. MRI is more sensitive than CT for the detection of early infarction, small infarcts, and those in the brain stem and posterior fossa .

In some instances, MRI may be the first imaging test performed, for example, in patients with unknown symptom onset, such as patients with wake-up stroke (WUS). Patients with WUS have often been excluded from thrombolysis because of the unknown time of symptom onset. However, stroke severity is similar in both patient groups, and it has been reported that patients with WUS may benefit from thrombolysis . In WUS, comprehensive stroke evaluation is more important as tPA is still under evaluation in this setting.
