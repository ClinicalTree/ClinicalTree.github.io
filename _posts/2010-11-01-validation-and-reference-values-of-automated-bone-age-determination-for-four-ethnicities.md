## Rationale and Objectives

Bone age (BA) rating is associated with a considerable rater variability, which would be eliminated with an automated computerized method. The aim of the study was to validate the BoneXpert method, an automated determination of BA, in American children of four ethnicities.

## Materials and Methods

The study is based on a publicly available database of hand x-rays of healthy children, established in a previous, National Institutes of Health–funded study. Radiographs of the left hand were recorded between 1993 and 2006 in Los Angeles, including 1100 images with two independent manual BA ratings and 280 additional images for which the manual ratings were not used. Images were evenly split between Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, and Asian children, and the age range was 0–18.99 years.

## Results

The automated method analyzed all images with BA >2.5 years for boys and >2 years for girls. The root-mean-square (RMS) error between the two manual ratings was 0.63 years, whereas the RMS deviation between the automated BA and the average of the two manual ratings was 0.61 years. The mean BA minus age was computed versus age for each sex and ethnicity. The largest deviation from zero was seen for Hispanic and Asian children older than 12 years, who were about 1 year advanced relative to the Greulich and Pyle standard.

## Conclusion

The automated method can analyze images of all ethnicities within a BA range of 2.5–17 years for boys and 2–15 years for girls, and can therefore eliminate the problem with rater variability in BA rating.

Bone age (BA) determination is one of the oldest procedures in pediatric radiology used in the diagnosis of many disorder, and to follow-up on treatment. It is often performed according to the method of Greulich and Pyle (GP) , which has remained unchanged for more than 50 years.

There are two problems related to BA rating: the rating is associated with considerable rater variability , and the interpretation of the BA in relation to the age is complicated by ethnical variations and secular trends. Consequently, the value of BA has been questioned.

## Analysis of Variances

Here N(0, _s_ ) denotes the normal distribution with mean 0 and SD _s_ . To get a BA value as close to the gold standard as practically possible, we use the average of the two manual ratings, AR; and we assume that the noise on each rating is independent, so we have


AR=(R1+R2)/2=I+N(0,s/2–√)

The observed deviations between BX and AR are then of the form

We determine _s_ obs not as the SD between BX and AR, but as the root mean square (RMS) error.


sobs=RMS(BX−AR)
s

The RMS error gives larger values than using the SD, but it is needed as a result of the simplified way we model the BX rating as having no bias relative to I; we effectively absorb any bias into an enlargement of the value _s_ obs .

![Figure 2, The difference between the two independent manual bone age (BA) ratings of the boys and girls of the Los Angeles study, plotted against the average of the two (a Bland-Altman plot). The curves are drawn at ± 2 standard deviations. The data points have been slightly staggered to reduce their overlap. The agreement is relatively poor for boys in the BA range 6–12 years and girls in the BA range 8.5–12 years. This is unfortunate, because in many of these children, pubertal development has not yet started and therefore BA assessment is the only available method to assess their physiological maturity. The agreement is also poor for boys at BA 18–19 years, where rater 1 often grades the image at 18 years when rater 2 grades it at 19 years. The rater variability is less for girls at BA 13–14 years and boys at BA 14–16 years, a period in which the growth plates undergo rapid maturation and fusion, thereby providing a very reliable maturity indicator.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ValidationandReferenceValuesofAutomatedBoneAgeDeterminationforFourEthnicities/1_1s20S1076633210003120.jpg)

Dashed lines at ± 1.57 years for boys and ± 1.34 years for girls represent the limit used to identify the cases for re-rating (marked with R). For girls older than 15 years of bone age, the deviations are very large, and this is indeed outside the intended bone age range of the automated method.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/ValidationandReferenceValuesofAutomatedBoneAgeDeterminationforFourEthnicities/2_1s20S1076633210003120.jpg)

The bias is defined as the average of the automated method minus the manual rating. The bone age range is 2.5–17 years for boys and 2–15 years for girls.
