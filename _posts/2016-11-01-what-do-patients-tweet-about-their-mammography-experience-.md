## Rationale and Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate themes related to patients' experience in undergoing mammography, as expressed on Twitter.

## Methods

A total of 464 tweets from July to December 2015 containing the hashtag #mammogram and relating to a patient's experience in undergoing mammography were reviewed.

## Results

Of the tweets, 45.5% occurred before the mammogram compared to 49.6% that occurred afterward (remainder of tweets indeterminate). However, in patients undergoing their first mammogram, 32.8% occurred before the examination, whereas in those undergoing follow-up mammogram, 53.0% occurred before the examination. Identified themes included breast compression (24.4%), advising other patients to undergo screening (23.9%), recognition of the health importance of the examination (18.8%), the act of waiting (10.1%), relief regarding results (9.7%), reflection that the examination was not that bad (9.1%), generalized apprehension regarding the examination (8.2%), interactions with staff (8.0%), the gown (5.0%), examination costs or access (3.4%), offering or reaching out for online support from other patients (3.2%), perception of screening as a sign of aging (2.4%), and the waiting room or waiting room amenities (1.3%). Of the tweets, 31.9% contained humor, of which 56.1% related to compression. Themes that were more common in patients undergoing their first, rather than follow-up, mammogram included breast compression (16.4% vs 9.1%, respectively) and that the test was not that bad (26.2% vs 7.6%, respectively).

## Conclusion

Online social media provides a platform for women to share their experiences and reactions in undergoing mammography, including humor, positive reflections, and encouragement of others to undergo the examination. Social media thus warrants further evaluation as a potential tool to help foster greater adherence to screening guidelines.

## Introduction

Early detection of breast cancer by screening mammography is associated with reduced breast cancer mortality . In addition, the American Cancer Society currently advises regular screening mammography in average risk patients . However, rates of screening mammography within the United States are suboptimal, with many women failing to undergo the examination . Reasons for guideline nonadherence are multifaceted. Of note, patients' perceptions and attitudes regarding the test influence their decision whether to seek screening. For example, patients may be fearful of pain or discomfort during the examination, harbor anxiety of a possible unfavorable result, or lack awareness of screening guidelines and the examination's health benefits .

Twitter is a public microblogging social media network with an estimated 500 million Tweets per day . Given its rapid and open discourse among any individuals with Internet access, as well as ease of accessing prior microblogging activity on a given topic, Twitter has developed into a valuable resource for health services research . One past study used Twitter to gain insights into the patient experience in undergoing magnetic resonance imaging . The dominant themes represented by the tweets differed somewhat from an earlier study using a more conventional data collection method . In a similar fashion, Twitter may provide a means of gaining deeper understanding of patients' perception of the experience of undergoing mammography. Therefore, our aim in this study was to evaluate themes related to the patient experience in undergoing mammography, as expressed on Twitter.
