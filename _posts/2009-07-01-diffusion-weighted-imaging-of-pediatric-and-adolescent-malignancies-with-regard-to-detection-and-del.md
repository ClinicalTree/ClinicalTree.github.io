## Rationale and Objective

To assess the value of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in pediatric and adolescent tumor patients with focus on detection and delineation of malignant tumors of the central nervous system, chest, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-nine pediatric and adolescent patients (17 males, 12 females, age, 2 months–20 years, mean age: 8.9 years) with clinically suspected malignant tumors were examined with use of a 1.5-T MR scanner with open bore design without sedation or general anesthesia. DWI images were acquired with a single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence in free breathing with b-values of 0, 500, and 1000 mm/s  2 . Images were assessed by two readers in consensus. Artifacts in DWI were graded as not relevant, acceptable, or nondiagnostic. DWI/apparent diffusion coefficient maps were correlated with T1-weighted post-contrast images, and the detectability and correct delineation of the tumors were graded using a three grade scale.

## Results

Free-breathing DWI was successfully performed in all patients. In 27 patients, no relevant artifacts were observed; acceptable artifacts were seen in two patients. In all patients, malignancies were detected both on DWI and T1-weighted gadolinium images. Detection and delineation of tumors were possible in all cases with both sequences; T1-weighted gadolinium imaging was superior to DWI in only three patients. Additionally, small diffusion restricted lymph nodes were detected in three patients.

## Conclusion

DWI is reliable for the accurate detection and delineation of malignant pediatric and adolescent tumors.

Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is an established imaging technique in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and widely used in imaging of the brain and central nervous system (CNS) pathologies, e.g., for early detection of ischemic and malignant changes. DWI applications outside the brain and CNS are becoming increasingly popular because rapid technologic developments of hardware and software, e.g., dedicated multichannel coils, faster and more powerful gradients, and parallel imaging techniques enable good image quality with high contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) enabling acquisition of additional, functional MRI data within a reasonable scan time even during free breathing. A rapid increase in published data in the last 5 years has been recognized, reporting experiences with DWI in the chest , breast , abdomen , urogenital , and musculoskeletal system . Although these data are encouraging, published data about clinical studies using DWI in pediatric patients outside the brain is rare . More data about the usefulness of DWI regarding detection and delineation of pathology is needed to implement DWI into routine MR protocols.

The purpose of this study was to assess the value of DWI MR in pediatric and adolescent tumor imaging regarding detection and delineation of malignant tumors of the CNS, chest, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system.
