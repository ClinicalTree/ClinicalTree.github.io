This first edition of _Atlas of Pulmonary Vascular Imaging_ contains a good source of pulmonary vascular anatomy and cases with emphasis on pathophysiology of the pulmonary vascular disease. The book is a good and easy read for radiology residents in general and pulmonary radiology fellows in particular.

The book is also very useful for the pediatric radiologists and emergency radiologists given the variety of cases that are included in both the congenital and acute settings.

The book has 12 sections and is introduced to the reader with anatomy and congenital anomalies and goes on to cover pulmonary artery embolism, aneurysms, in situ thrombosis, infection, vasculitides affecting pulmonary arteries, trauma scenarios, tumors, and systemic lung diseases affecting the pulmonary arteries.

The book is very easy to follow and has variety of cases for a particular section. For example, the embolism section covers the characteristics of acute versus chronic pulmonary embolism signs on computed tomography with beautiful graphic illustrations and discussion of relevant ventilation and perfusion scintigraphy. There is description of pathophysiology of various etiologies of pulmonary emboli, including rare examples such as talc and silicone in easy-to-follow bullet format.

In the tumor section, however, the metabolic characterization of thrombi and tumor with 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography could use more detail. Later sections deal with systemic lung disease such as sarcoid, hepatopulmonary syndrome, sickle cell disease, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, pulmonary hemosiderosis, and others. Cardiac disease and pulmonary hypertension are briefly covered.

Overall image quality is good; however, areas of chest radiographs could have been magnified to highlight the important findings. The book can serve as a quick reference to pulmonary vascular pathologies.
