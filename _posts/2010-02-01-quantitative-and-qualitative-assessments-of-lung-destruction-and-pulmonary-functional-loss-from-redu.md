## Rationale and Objectives

Academic and clinical interest in reducing radiation from computed tomography (CT) examinations has increased, and the purpose of this study was to determine the capabilities of reduced-dose multidetector-row CT (MDCT) in assessing lung destruction and pulmonary functional loss in pulmonary emphysema patients.

## Materials and Methods

Twenty-five consecutive smokers (15 men and 10 women; mean age 67.9 years; age range 49–86 years) underwent MDCT examinations using two different effective tube currents (standard-dose protocol \[150 mAs\] and reduced-dose protocol \[50 mAs\]). For quantitative and qualitative assessments of lung destruction in each subject, percentage of low attenuation emphysematous destruction areas (%LAAs) were computationally calculated, and visual emphysema scores (ESs) were determined for both protocols. To determine the capabilities for quantitative and qualitative assessments of lung destruction by using reduced-dose protocol, %LAAs and ESs of both protocols were compared statistically. To compare the capabilities for quantitative and qualitative assessments of pulmonary functional loss, %LAAs and ESs of both protocols were correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC).

## Results

%LAAs and ESs had significant correlations between both protocols (%LAAs: _r_ = 0.95, _P_ < .001; ESs: _r_ = 0.97, _P_ < .001). The limits of agreement of %LAAs were −1.8 ± 9.2%. The agreement of ESs between both protocols was substantial (κ = 0.70). %LAAs and ESs of both protocols had significant correlations with FEV1/FVC (%LAAs of 150 mAs: _r_ = −0.49, _P_ < .05; %LAAs of 50 mAs: _r_ = −0.44, _P_ < .05; ESs of 150 mAs: _r_ = −0.67, _P_ < .001; ESs of 50 mAs: _r_ = −0.66, _P_ < .001).

## Conclusion

Reduced-dose MDCT had a potential of substitution for standard-dose MDCT on the both assessments in pulmonary emphysema patients.

With recent advances in multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT), computed tomography (CT) is now a powerful tool for the assessment of the diagnosis and management of lung diseases. Recently, quantitative and qualitative lung functional assessments with MDCT have become a popular method for assessing the extent and severity of pulmonary emphysema . Before now, assessments using MDCT have mainly been evaluated by low attenuation area (LAA) analysis for quantitative assessments and visual qualitative scores to assess lung destruction in pulmonary emphysema patients. There have been many reports that CT assessment is effective regarding pulmonary functional loss . Results of preliminary studies suggest that CT may have a role in patient selection for lung volume reduction surgery . In addition, it is important to have a sensitive and accurate test for assessing the degree of pulmonary emphysema to promote early detection of disease and monitoring of response to treatment under development of a variety of pharmacologic and endobronchial treatments of patients with smoking-related emphysema .

On the other hand, because the increasing frequency of CT examinations makes radiation dose an important issue, academic and clinical interest in reducing radiation from chest CT examinations has also increased greatly in the last decade . The effect of dose reduction on chest CT examinations has been investigated using subjective assessments of image quality or diagnostic performance . The results have suggested that the tube current–time product could be dramatically reduced for certain applications. These applications include pulmonary angiography, the detection of lung nodules, bronchiectasis, ground-glass opacity, chronic infiltrative lung disease, and pleural and pulmonary asbestos-related abnormalities . Assessments of the repeatability of low-dose quantitative chest CT on the assessment of pulmonary emphysema have suggested the utility of low-dose quantitative chest CT .
