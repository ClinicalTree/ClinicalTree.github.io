## Rationale and Objectives

The US Mammography Quality Standards Act mandates medical audits to track breast cancer outcomes data associated with interpretive performance. The objectives of our study were to assess the content and style of audits and examine use of, attitudes toward, and perceptions of the value that radiologists' have regarding mandated medical audits.

## Materials and Methods

Radiologists ( _n_ = 364) at mammography registries in seven US states contributing data to the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) were invited to participate. We examined radiologists' demographic characteristics, clinical experience, use, attitudes, and perceived value of audit reports from results of a self-administered survey. Information on the content and style of BCSC audits provided to radiologists and facilities was obtained from site investigators. Radiologists' characteristics were analyzed according to whether or not they self-reported receiving regular mammography audit reports. Latent class analysis was used to classify radiologists' individual perceptions of audit reports into overall probabilities of having “favorable,” “less favorable,” “neutral,” or “unfavorable” attitudes toward audit reports.

## Results

Seventy-one percent (257 of 364) of radiologists completed the survey; two radiologists did not complete the audit survey question, leaving 255 for the final study cohort. Most survey respondents received regular audits (91%), paid close attention to their audit numbers (83%), found the reports valuable (87%), and felt that audit reports prompted them to improve interpretative performance (75%). Variability was noted in the style, target audience, and frequency of reports provided by the BCSC registries. One in four radiologists reported that if Congress mandates more intensive auditing requirements, but does not provide funding to support this regulation they may stop interpreting mammograms.

## Conclusion

Radiologists working in breast imaging generally had favorable opinions of audit reports, which were mandated by Congress; however, almost 1 in 10 radiologists reported that they did not receive audits.

In 1992, the US Congress enacted the Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA), which established the first national quality standards for mammography facilities in the United States. MQSA was initiated in response to concerns from the public and medical community about the extensive variability of mammography among facilities . The goal of MQSA is to provide all women living in the United States with equal access to quality mammography, regardless of their geographic location. Under MQSA, mammography facilities are required to have a US Food and Drug Administration–approved accreditation body review their radiological equipment, personnel qualifications, and quality assurance processes every 3 years to ensure that baseline quality standards are practiced .

Mammography outcome audits are one of the quality assurance regulations for mammography facilities that fall under MQSA. The basic elements of MQSA's medical audit include: 1) a method to collect follow-up data for positive mammograms (defined as mammograms with final Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) assessment categories of “suspicious” or “highly suggestive of malignancy”); 2) a system to collect pathology results (benign vs. malignant) for all biopsies performed among mammograms interpreted as “suspicious” or “highly suggestive of malignancy”; 3) methods to correlate pathology and mammography results; and 4) review of known false negatives (examinations assessed as “negative,” “benign,” or “probably benign” that became known to the facility as positive for cancer within 12 months of mammography examination) . In addition, at least once every 12 months, facilities are required to designate an interpreting physician to review the medical outcomes data and notify other interpreting physicians that their individual results are available for review. Food and Drug Administration regulations do not specifically require that individual radiologists review their outcomes . Approaches to implement the elements described previously are left to the facility's discretion .
