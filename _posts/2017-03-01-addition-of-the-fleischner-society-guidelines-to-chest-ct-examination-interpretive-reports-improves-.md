## Rationale and Objectives

The study aimed to determine whether the addition of the Fleischner Society guidelines to chest computed tomography (CT) reports identifying incidental pulmonary nodules affects follow-up care.

## Patients and Methods

Beginning in 2008, a template containing the Fleischner Society guidelines was added at the interpreting radiologist's discretion to chest CT reports describing incidental solid pulmonary nodules at our institution. The records of all medical centers in Olmsted county were used to capture the complete medical history of local patients >35 years old diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule from April 1, 2008 to October 1, 2011. Patients with a history of cancer or previously diagnosed nodule, or who died before follow-up, were excluded. Patients were categorized according to whether they did (“template group”) or did not (“control group”) have the template added. Nodule size and smoking history were used to determine recommended follow-up care. Differences in follow-up were compared between groups using Pearson's chi-square test.

## Results

A total of 510 patients (276 in the template group, 234 in the control group) were included in the study. Only 198 patients (39%) received their recommended follow-up care. Template group patients were significantly more likely to receive recommended follow-up care compared to control group patients (45% vs 31%, _P_ = .0014). Most patients whose management did not adhere to Fleischner Society guidelines did not receive a recommended follow-up chest CT (210 out of 312, 67%).

## Conclusions

The addition of the Fleischner Society guidelines to chest CT reports significantly increases the likelihood of receiving recommended follow-up care for patients with incidental pulmonary nodules. Additional education is needed to improve appropriate guideline utilization by radiologists and adherence by ordering providers.

## Introduction

Lung cancer accounts for approximately 27% of all cancer deaths and is the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United States . The American Cancer Society estimates 221,200 new cases of lung cancer and 158,040 deaths from lung cancer in 2015 . Patients with stage IA lung cancer have a 5-year survival rate greater than 60%; however, survival rates rapidly decline as the stage of disease increases.

With increasing utilization and improving resolution of computed tomography (CT), growing numbers of noncalcified solid pulmonary nodules are detected. In response to the need for follow-up management of these incidentally found nodules, the Fleischner Society devised a set of evidence-based recommendations in 2005 . These recommendations classify patients at least 35 years old into low- and high-risk groups depending on smoking history, family history of lung cancer, or exposure to asbestos, radon, or uranium. Despite publication of such guidelines, follow-up of solid pulmonary nodules has still been suboptimal. Eisenberg et al. reported only 79% of radiologists were aware of and only 59% of radiology practices employed such guidelines .
