## Rationale and Objectives

The identification of the most suspect enhancing part of a lesion is regarded as a major diagnostic criterion in dynamic magnetic resonance mammography. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) software allows the semi-automatic analysis of the kinetic characteristics of complete enhancing lesions, providing additional information about lesion vasculature. The diagnostic value of this information has not yet been quantified.

## Materials and Methods

Consecutive patients from routine diagnostic studies (1.5 T, 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine, dynamic gradient-echo sequences at 1-minute intervals) were analyzed prospectively using CAD. Dynamic sequences were processed and reduced to a parametric map. Curve types were classified by initial signal increase (not significant, intermediate, and strong) and the delayed time course of signal intensity (continuous, plateau, and washout). Lesion enhancement was measured using CAD. The most suspect curve, the curve-type distribution percentage, and combined dynamic data were compared. Statistical analysis included logistic regression analysis and receiver-operating characteristic analysis.

## Results

Fifty-one patients with 46 malignant and 44 benign lesions were enrolled. On receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the most suspect curve showed diagnostic accuracy of 76.7 ± 5%. In comparison, the curve-type distribution percentage demonstrated accuracy of 80.2 ± 4.9%. Combined dynamic data had the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3 ± 4.2%). These differences did not achieve statistical significance. With appropriate cutoff values, sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were found to be 80.4% and 72.7% for the most suspect curve, 76.1% and 83.6% for the curve-type distribution percentage, and 78.3% and 84.5% for both parameters.

## Conclusions

The integration of whole-lesion dynamic data tends to improve specificity. However, no statistical significance backs up this finding.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive method for the detection of breast cancer, especially the preoperative detection of multifocality or multicentricity . Since the first application of fast gradient-echo sequences with repetitive measurements of signal intensity after contrast material injection , several studies have shown the diagnostic value of signal-intensity time-course data for differentiation between benign and malignant breast lesions on MRI . Essential for the different signal-intensity time courses after contrast material injection in benign and malignant lesions is the stronger neoangiogenesis in malignant lesions, which is the basis of exponential tumor growth .

It is well known that signal-intensity time-curve analysis, mainly performed using the region-of-interest (ROI) method, can differentiate between benign and malignant lesions. Kuhl et al reported sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 83%, respectively, and diagnostic accuracy of 86%. According to the American College of Radiology's Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon , kinetic enhancement features besides morphologic criteria are a major diagnostic criterion in magnetic resonance mammography (MRM). The most suspect part of a lesion is mostly identified by the manual placement of several ROIs by a radiologist. This practice may lead to mistakes if an ROI is placed in a less vital and thus less enhancing area. Furthermore, the detection of the most suspect enhancing part of a lesion is regarded as a time-consuming process . To minimize interobserver variability, Mussurakis et al proposed semi-automatic ROI analysis. In a database of 121 lesions, similar classification performance between time curves obtained by an experienced radiologist and those obtained with semi-automatic curve analysis was found .
