## Rationale and Objectives

We evaluated the effects of a streamlined emergency department (ED) policy for CT ordering, pre- and postimplementation, on the completed imaging study rates of all after-hours computed tomography (CT) studies. The study hypothesis was that a streamlined CT ordering process would increase the utilization rates of ED CT.

## Materials and Methods

A prospective cohort study was used to estimate the effect of enhancing a preauthorization policy for after-hours CT studies requested through the ED, performed between January 1 and June 30, 2013, and the postimplementation period, performed between January 1 and June 30, 2014. Inclusion criteria were all CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis, musculoskeletal, neurological, and neuroangiographic examinations performed by ED physicians on adult patients. Pre- and postintervention examination imaging study rates were compared.

## Results

The period following implementation of the preauthorization policy was associated with a statistically significant increase in utilization for most subtypes of CT examinations (CT chest, CT abdomen/pelvis, and musculoskeletal CT studies), with the exception of neurological examinations, which showed a significant decrease.

## Conclusions

This study demonstrates a trend toward increased utilization of CT resources after implementation of an ED preauthorization policy with most study types showing significantly increased utilization. In the case of neurological examinations, a potential “substitution effect” was observed, whereby the rates of neuroangiographic studies showed a marked increase, offsetting the decrease in general neurological examinations performed. Departments considering implementation of preauthorization policies should weigh carefully the benefits of ED workflow efficiencies against the potential harms of increased CT use.

## Background

Numerous North American healthcare system stakeholders have expressed concern about emergency department (ED) overutilization of imaging studies, particularly computed tomography (CT) imaging. A number of hypotheses have been raised as to the factors that may lead to overutilization including incorporation of a CT scanner within an ED . Inappropriate imaging use may be associated with rising costs of health care as well as increased lifetime risk of cancer, and it has been suggested by several authors that increased imaging resource use may not lead to improved patient outcomes . Results of certain studies have suggested that, given considerable ED inter-physician variability in the use of specific CT study types, a standardized approach to ordering CT studies is recommended, ideally including a straightforward policy for ED physicians during the imaging examination order process .

Our center created a streamlined CT examination ordering policy that was implemented in the belief that it would improve ease of CT ordering to decrease ED patient turnaround times. The hypothesis is that a streamlined ordering process for all commonly requested CT ED studies should decrease the length of stay for ED patients who require one of those CT examinations included within the policy. Other centers have experimented with the implementation of ED decision support systems in an effort to decrease the use of unnecessary imaging with either equivocal or mixed results when there were fewer limitations placed on imaging resource availability .
