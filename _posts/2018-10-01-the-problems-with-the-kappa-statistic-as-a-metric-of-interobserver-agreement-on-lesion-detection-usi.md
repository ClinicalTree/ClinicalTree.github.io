## Rationale and Objectives

To point out the problems with Cohen kappa statistic and to explore alternative metrics to determine interobserver agreement on lesion detection when locations are not prespecified.

## Materials and Methods

Use of kappa and two alternative methods, namely index of specific agreement (ISA) and modified kappa, for measuring interobserver agreement on the location of detected lesions are presented. These indices of agreement are illustrated by application to a retrospective multireader study in which nine readers detected and scored prostate cancer lesions in 163 consecutive patients ( _n_ = 110 cases, _n_ = 53 controls) using the guideline of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging.

## Results

The proposed modified kappa, which properly corrects for the amount of agreement by chance, is shown to be approximately equivalent to the ISA. In the prostate cancer data, average kappa, modified kappa, and ISA equaled 30%, 55%, and 57%, respectively, for all lesions and 20%, 87%, and 87%, respectively, for index lesions.

## Conclusions

The application of kappa could result in a substantial downward bias in reader agreement on lesion detection when locations are not prespecified. ISA is recommended for assessment of reader agreement on lesion detection.

## Introduction

Imaging plays an integral role in cancer lesion detection and characterization in oncology practice. As subjective imaging features often require a high level of expertise, imaging modalities must be shown to have acceptable reproducibility before they can be widely used as diagnostic tools and assist in treatment decisions. For this purpose, imaging techniques have been evaluated for interobserver agreement in multireader studies. A common design used in these studies is to have multiple readers normally blinded to clinical and pathologic outcomes score each object on an image independently, using a dichotomized classification or ordinal scale to characterize the likelihood of clinical significance . The imaging objects might be lesions previously identified, sectors of an organ, or multiple anatomical districts .

Recently, an alternative design has been used in multireader studies in which readers are asked to identify and score lesions on images . Two types of interobserver agreement can be simultaneously assessed in studies implemented under this design: (1) lesion detection and (2) scoring of identified lesions. Agreement on scoring of identified lesions can be calculated by kappa. Determination of reader agreement on lesion detection, however, is challenging because lesions can appear anywhere on an image and readers vary in interpretation of lesion location. For example, two readers might map distinct lesions to the same sector or map the same lesion to different sectors as demonstrated in  Figure 1 for the sector map of prostate, resulting in false-positive (FP) and false-negative agreement, respectively.

![Figure 1, Sector-based approach to analyzing interobserver agreement. Data taken from Greer et al. (6) . Two readers prospectively detected all clinically significant lesions on a patient with prostate cancer and mapped those lesions on a sector map. (a) Reader 1 (right) found a lesion in sector m4, as did reader 2 (left), giving positive agreement for that sector. However, this is a false-positive result as each reader obviously was describing different lesions in the same sector. (b) Reader 1 (right) and reader 2 (left) found a lesion in sector m3; however, reader 2 described this lesion as extending to the base of the prostate to b3, whereas reader 1 limited evaluation to the mid of the prostate. This gives a false-negative agreement for an equivalent lesion.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/TheProblemswiththeKappaStatisticasaMetricofInterobserverAgreementonLesionDetectionUsingaThirdreaderApproachWhenLocationsAreNotPrespecified/0_1s20S1076633218300692.jpg)
