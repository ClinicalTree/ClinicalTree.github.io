## Rationale and Objectives

To determine the accuracy and sensitivity for dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) discrimination of uric acid (UA) stones from other (non-UA) renal stones in a commercially implemented product.

## Materials and Methods

Forty human renal stones comprising uric acid ( _n_ = 16), hydroxyapatite ( _n_ = 8), calcium oxalate ( _n_ = 8), and cystine ( _n_ = 8) were inserted in four porcine kidneys (10 each) and placed inside a 32-cm water tank anterior to a cadaver spine. Spiral dual-energy scans were obtained on a dual-source, 64-slice computed tomography (CT) system using a clinical protocol and automatic exposure control. Scanning was performed at two different collimations (0.6 mm and 1.2 mm) and within three phantom sizes (medium, large, and extra large) resulting in a total of six image datasets. These datasets were analyzed using the dual-energy software tool available on the CT system for both accuracy (number of stones correctly classified as either UA or non-UA) and sensitivity (for UA stones). Stone characterization was correlated with micro-CT.

## Results

For the medium and large phantom sizes, the DECT technique demonstrated 100% accuracy (40/40), regardless of collimation. For the extra large phantom size and the 0.6-mm collimation (resulting in the noisiest dataset), three (two cystine and one small UA) stones could not be classified (93% accuracy and 94% sensitivity). For the extra large phantom size and the 1.2-mm collimation, the dual-energy tool failed to identify two small UA stones (95% accuracy and 88% sensitivity).

## Conclusions

In an anthropomorphic phantom model, dual-energy CT can accurately discriminate uric acid stones from other stone types.

Symptomatic urinary stone disease affects approximately 900,000 persons in the United States each year, resulting in annual medical cost of $5.3 billion. Nephrolithiasis has traditionally been evaluated using plain film radiographic techniques with or without tomography or administration of intravenous contrast for excretory urography. Over recent years, however, computed tomography (CT) has supplanted these traditional techniques because of increased sensitivity, speed, and the lack of intravenous contrast ( ). Furthermore, improved CT acquisition techniques can allow a lower radiation dose than was required for a traditional excretory urogram ( ).

Although state-of-the-art CT provides accurate submillimeter details of the size and location of renal stones ( ), current routine clinical image analysis does not differentiate stone composition. This is particularly important in the case of uric acid (UA) stones (∼10% of cases), because urinary alkalinization can be prescribed to dissolve UA stones and could thereby be initiated at presentation rather than following lengthy metabolic workup. Therefore simple and reliable differentiation of UA versus non-UA stone composition could potentially allow patients with UA stones to avoid invasive interventional urinary procedures for stone removal or external shock wave lithotripsy, both of which are expensive and might result in renal hemorrhage, fibrosis, or hypertension ( ).

![Figure 2, A simplified description of how the DE algorithm works. If a datapoint corresponding to a stone with unknown composition falls below the bisector line (dashed) dividing the angle between the uric acid (UA) and non-UA line segments, the algorithm will characterize such stone as a UA stone (open circle). If an unknown datapoint falls above the angle bisector line, the corresponding stone will be identified as a non-UA stone (gray circle).](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/NoninvasiveDifferentiationofUricAcidversusNonUricAcidKidneyStonesUsingDualEnergyCT/1_1s20S1076633207005235.jpg)

![Figure 4, Micro–computed tomography slices showing the four types of stone used in this study and their generally homogeneous nature. Uric acid and cystine stones are generally the purest of the stones, with the uniform shade of gray in the examples shown here indicating such purity. The dark spots in the cystine stone (lower right) indicate the presence of void regions, which are common in this stone type. The layered nature of the apatite stone (upper right) is typical of this stone type, and the lower attenuation layers (darker gray) often contain calcium oxalate. The calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) example (lower left) shows the typical uniform distribution of mineral in this stone type, with some void regions indicated by the darker grays.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/NoninvasiveDifferentiationofUricAcidversusNonUricAcidKidneyStonesUsingDualEnergyCT/3_1s20S1076633207005235.jpg)
