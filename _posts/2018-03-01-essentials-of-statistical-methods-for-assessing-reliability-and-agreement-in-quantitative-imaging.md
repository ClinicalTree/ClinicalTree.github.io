Quantitative imaging is increasing in almost all fields of radiological science. Modern quantitative imaging biomarkers measure complex parameters including metabolism, tissue microenvironment, tissue chemical properties or physical properties. In this paper, we focus on measurement reliability assessment in quantitative imaging. We review essential concepts related to measurement such as measurement variability and measurement error. We also discuss reliability study methods for intraobserver and interobserver variability, and the applicable statistical tests including: intraclass correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman graphs and limits of agreement, standard error of measurement, and coefficient of variation.

## Introduction

Quantitative imaging technologies are increasingly used for the measurement of normal biological processes, pathologic processes, patient risk stratification, treatment response measurement in clinical care, and drug development . The goal of quantitative imaging is objective, accurate, and precise measurement of quantifiable features obtained from in vivo imaging studies, termed quantitative imaging biomarkers (QIBs). The simplest QIBs comprise measurement of the size of organs, vessels, or lesions. More complex QIBs measure parameters including metabolism, for example, the standardized uptake value in positron emission tomography imaging; tissue microenvironment, for example, diffusion or perfusion; tissue chemical properties, for example, spectroscopy; or physical properties, for example, tissue stiffness . QIBs are continuous variables, of which there are two subtypes: (1) ratio variables, such as shear wave velocity measured in meters per second (m/s) by shear wave sonoelastography methods for liver fibrosis assessment, or (2) interval variables, such as computed tomography (CT) densitometry measured in Hounsfield units for estimating emphysema severity. Ordinal variables are not QIBs. For example, the widely used Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) classification system used for prostate magnetic resonance imaging assessment has five numbered categories: PI-RADS 1 (very low probability) to PI-RADS 5 (very high probability) of prostate cancer . Although these categories are numbered, the numbers denote order, rather than quantity, and therefore PI-RADS is not a QIB.

To be clinically useful, QIBs must be reliably comparable to one another and to known reference measurements . The goal of this paper is to facilitate better understanding of QIB reliability measurement by imaging researchers new to the field, and to assist researchers to incorporate reliability study design principles into their own quantitative imaging studies.

In this review, we define relevant metrologic terminology and concepts including measurement, reliability, reproducibility, and agreement. We discuss common reliability studies, including intraobserver, interobserver, and method comparison studies. We introduce guidelines for reporting , reviewing , and critical appraisal of reliability studies, and we review statistical measures of reliability for continuous variables, including intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Pearson correlation coefficient, and measures of agreement including Bland-Altman graph and limits of agreement, standard error of measurement (SEM), and coefficient of variation (CV).

## Definitions and Statistical Concepts

Measurements are central to biomedical research and clinical practice and are used to evaluate current disease status and change over time. In population studies, measurements permit useful comparison of health outcomes within or between patients. The Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance (QIBA) is an initiative by the Radiological Society of North America to promote the use of QIBs in clinical research and practice. QIBA working groups defined QIB concepts based on the Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology in 2012–2013 . For QIBs, _measurement_ is the process of experimentally obtaining one or more quantity values that can reasonably be attributed to a quantity. Quantity is a property of a variable, where the property has a magnitude and can be expressed as a number, which is called quantity value. The _measurand_ is the quantity intended to be measured .

Mu (µ) or mean, is a measure of central tendency of a data set, and is computed as the sum of the data set values divided by the number of values. Sigma (σ) or standard deviation (SD) is a measure used to quantify the dispersion of a set of data values, and is computed as the square root of the average of the squared differences from the mean (µ) divided by number of values minus 1. A low SD implies that the data values tend to be close to the mean, whereas a high SD implies the data points are spread out over a wider value range.

where _x_ 1 is observer 1, _x_ 2 is the other observer, _n_ is the number of patients, and _σ  diff_ is the SD of the difference of measurements between observers. For **Example 2** , using the Example 1 data set, we have drawn a Bland-Altman graph using MedCalc for Windows, version 12.4.0.0. This illustrates agreement between two observers and depicts bias of 0.5 and limits of agreement of (−9.9 to 11.0) (  Fig 2 ).
