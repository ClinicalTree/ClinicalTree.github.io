## Rationale and Objectives

The role of transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) in patients with hematologic malignancies, particularly in discriminating between malignant and benign etiologies, has not been well studied. Hence, the diagnostic efficacy and safety of computed tomography–guided TTNB were retrospectively evaluated in this population.

## Materials and Methods

The records of 53 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent TTNB from August 1, 1999, to July 31, 2007, were reviewed. Potential factors for increased diagnostic yield and risk for complications were collected and analyzed, including the status of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, chemotherapy, and transplant as well as lesion size and location. Both cytopathologic and microbiologic results were assessed.

## Results

The most common underlying hematologic malignancy was non-Hodgkin lymphoma, in 20 patients (37.7%). Lesions were most frequently located in the left upper lobe (16 \[30.2%\]); 33 lesions were pleural based (63.5%), and nine had cavitation (17.0%). TTNB established specific diagnoses in 22 patients (41.5%): malignancies was found in 12 (22.6%) and infections in 10 (18.9%). Sensitivity for detecting malignancy was 50.0%, and sensitivity for the detection of a specific infection was 40.0%. There were no false-positive results. Complications occurred in nine patients (17.0%): self-limited small-volume hemoptysis in one patient (1.9%) and pneumothorax in eight patients (15.1%), one requiring chest tube placement. The results of TTNB led to changes in antimicrobial therapy for eight of the 22 patients with specific diagnoses (36.4%).

## Conclusions

TTNB is a safe diagnostic procedure in patients with hematologic malignancies and has the potential of making specific diagnoses with minimal morbidity.

Pulmonary syndromes are relatively common in patients with hematologic malignancies . Although infections are a major concern, the differential diagnosis includes infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal, parasitic) and noninfectious (malignancy, drug toxicity, inflammatory disorders) etiologies . Concurrent pulmonary pathologic processes are common . Routine chest radiography and sputum samples usually fail to diagnose concomitant pathologies , especially in patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and empirical therapy .

Establishing a diagnosis is difficult in this population; early diagnosis and prompt initiation of effective therapy are crucial for successful clinical outcomes and subsequent management . Additionally, an aggressive approach to diagnosis limits unnecessary drug toxicity and exposure to potentially inadequate therapy .
