## Rationale and Objectives

When pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, and Rathke's cleft cyst grow in the sellar and suprasellar region, it is often difficult to differentiate among these three lesions on magnetic resonance (MR) images. The purpose of this study was to apply an artificial neural network (ANN) for differential diagnosis among these three lesions with MR images and retrospectively evaluate the effect of ANN output on radiologists' performance.

## Materials and Methods

Forty-three patients with sellar-suprasellar masses were studied. The ANN was designed to differentiate among pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, and Rathke's cleft cyst by using patients' ages and nine MR image findings obtained by three neuroradiologists using a subjective rating scale. In the observer performance test, MR images were viewed by nine radiologists, including four neuroradiologists and five general radiologists, first without and then with ANN output. The radiologists' performance was evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic analysis with a continuous rating scale.

## Results

The ANN showed high performance in differentiation among the three lesions (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, 0.990). The average area under the curve for all radiologists for differentiation among the three lesions increased significantly from 0.910 to 0.985 ( _P_ = .0024) when they used the computer output. Areas under the curves for the general radiologists and neuroradiologists increased from 0.876 to 0.983 ( _P_ = .0083) and from 0.952 to 0.989 ( _P_ = .038), respectively.

## Conclusion

In diagnostic performance for differentiation among pituitary macroadenoma, craniopharyngioma, and Rathke's cleft cyst with MR imaging, the ANN resulted in parity between neuroradiologists and general radiologists.

Pituitary adenoma is a common lesion in the sellar-suprasellar region and the third most common intracranial tumor after meningiomas and gliomas . Although most pituitary adenomas are histologically benign, they sometimes extend to adjacent structures. In addition, intratumoral hemorrhage and cystic change frequently accompany tumor growth . Rathke's cleft cyst and craniopharyngioma are also common lesions in the sellar-suprasellar region . When they grow in the sellar and suprasellar region, it is often difficult to differentiate among the three lesions . Because the surgical approach or treatment is different for each of these diseases, it is important to diagnose these lesions accurately. A trans-sphenoidal approach is usually selected in cases of pituitary macroadenomas, whereas a trans-sphenoidal or transcranial approach is selected in cases of craniopharyngiomas. Asymptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts are usually only observed, without any intervention.

With regard to other organs, the concept of computer-aided diagnosis for screening breast cancer with mammography and for screening lung cancer with chest radiography and/or computed tomography has been applied . The artificial neural network (ANN) is an important tool for computer-aided diagnostic systems, and the usefulness of ANN systems for the differentiation of diseases in many different organs has been reported . To our knowledge, however, an ANN scheme has not been applied to the differentiation among intracranial masses with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Our purpose in this study was to evaluate retrospectively the effect of an ANN on radiologists' performance in differentiation among pituitary adenoma, Rathke's cleft cyst, and craniopharyngioma on MR images.
