## Objective

We aimed to evaluate a new model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIRn) algorithm either with spatial resolution and noise reduction balance (MBIR  STND ) or spatial resolution preference (MBIR  RP20 ) for quantitative analysis of airway in low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) with a computer-aided detection (CAD) software, in comparison to adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) in routine-dose CT.

## Methods

Thirty patients who underwent both the routine-dose (noise index \[NI\] = 14 HU) and low-dose (at 30% level with NI = 28 HU) CT examination for pulmonary disease were included. Image acquisition was performed with 120 kVp tube voltage and automatic tube current modulation. Routine-dose scans were reconstructed with ASIR, whereas low-dose scans were reconstructed with ASIR, MBIR  STND , and MBIR  RP20 . Airway dimensions of the right middle lobe bronchus from the four reconstructions were measured using CAD software. Two radiologists used a semiquantitative 5 scoring criteria (−2, inferior to; +2, superior to; −1 slightly inferior to; +1, slightly superior to; and 0, equal to ASIR in routine-dose CT) to rate the subjective image quality of MBIR  STND and MBIR  RP20 of airway trees. The paired _t_ test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for statistical comparison.

## Results

The low-dose CT provided 70.76% dose reduction compared to the routine-dose CT (0.88 ± 0.83 mSv vs 3.01 ± 1.89 mSv). MBIR  STND and MBIR  RP20 with low-dose CT provided longer bronchial length measurements and were better in measurement variability and continuity and completeness of bronchial walls than ASIR in routine-dose CT ( _P_ < .05). MBIR  STND was better for subjective noise and MBIR  RP20 for showing distal branches  .

## Conclusions

MBIR  STND and MBIR  RP20 algorithms provide better airway quantification at 30% of the radiation dose, compared to ASIR at routine-dose CT.

## Introduction

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been widely used for the diagnosis and identification of lung disease, but the potential risk of radiation-induced carcinogenesis, particularly in younger patients, might limit a wider use of this imaging method in clinical practice. Although the introduction of low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) protocols was found effective in detecting peripheral lung cancers and small lung structure in lung , it may be more difficult in low-dose screening with the increased image noise and thin slice thickness.

The isotropic imaging of MDCT makes it possible for imaging-based computer-aided detection (CAD) to provide a three-dimensional automatic approach to identify the airway tree , and to improve the objectivity and repeatability of imaging diagnosis and therefore increase the diagnostic accuracy for lung diseases. However, the image noise, motion artifacts, and partial volume effects caused by the uneven distribution of gray in the airway will lead to distal local wall fracture and segmentation of the bronchioles , and may diffuse to cause leakage in the lung parenchyma when using CAD .
