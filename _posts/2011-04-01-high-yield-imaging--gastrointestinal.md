_High-Yield Imaging: Gastrointestinal_ , by Drs Richard Gore and Marc Levine, is part of the first-edition _Expert Consult Series_ . Drs Gore and Levine are well-established experts in the field, having authored the comprehensive, two-volume _Textbook of Gastrointestinal Radiology_ . This book presents a wide spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases covered in the two-volume text in a more concise and very visually appealing manner.

The book is well organized, predominantly by gastrointestinal organ type, with additional sections dedicated to general radiographic principles and pediatric gastrointestinal imaging. Each organ-specific section, in turn, is divided into categories of disease. For example, the section detailing the esophagus contains nine parts, each detailing specific categories of disorders, such as motility disorders, gastroesophageal reflux, infectious esophagitis, and so on. Discussion of each disorder includes a description of typical imaging findings, some using multiple modalities, pathology, and differential diagnoses. Separately boxed sections describing diagnostic pearls are particularly useful. By far, the most unique feature of this text is a boxed section titled “What the Referring Physician Needs to Know.” Radiologists of every level will find this information particularly useful when responding to inquiries by ordering physicians.

The images in the text are of generally high quality, with fluoroscopic images predominant in sections describing the hollow gastrointestinal organs. Computed tomographic, ultrasound, magnetic resonance, and nuclear imaging serve to illustrate diseases in the solid organs and peritoneal cavity. A few drawings scattered throughout the text serve to demonstrate principles of imaging, physiology, or anatomy. Captions for images lie immediately below each, obviating the need to turn pages back and forth to match an image with its respective caption.

An additional feature of this text is that it provides a code to access its online version. The online text is somewhat cumbersome to operate and requires opening many menus and pages to access information and imaging contained on one page in the print version. With this in mind, the decision to acquire this book should be made for the physical, printed text, with the online version viewed as a marginally useful bonus.

_High-Yield Imaging: Gastrointestinal_ is an ideal reference for the practicing radiologist, as it contains excellent information that is readily accessed through its organized format. Radiology residents and body imaging fellows would also find this text of use throughout clinical rotations, for board exam preparation, and as an on-call resource. Subspecialists trained in gastrointestinal or body imaging will benefit more from the comprehensive two-volume text by Drs Gore and Levine.
