## Rationale and Objectives

Emerging alternative metrics leverage social media and other online platforms to provide immediate measures of biomedical articles' reach among diverse public audiences. We aimed to compare traditional citation and alternative impact metrics for articles in popular general radiology journals.

## Materials and Methods

All 892 original investigations published in 2013 issues of _Academic Radiology_ , _American Journal of Roentgenology_ , _Journal of the American College of Radiology_ , and _Radiology_ were included. Each article's content was classified as imaging vs nonimaging. Traditional journal citations to articles were obtained from Web of Science. Each article's Altmetric Attention Score (Altmetric), representing weighted mentions across a variety of online platforms, was obtained from  Altmetric.com . Statistical assessment included the McNemar test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Pearson correlation.

## Results

Mean and median traditional citation counts were 10.7 ± 15.4 and 5 vs 3.3 ± 13.3 and 0 for Altmetric. Among all articles, 96.4% had ≥1 traditional citation vs 41.8% for Altmetric ( _P_ < 0.001). Online platforms for which at least 5% of the articles were represented included Mendeley (42.8%), Twitter (34.2%), Facebook (10.7%), and news outlets (8.4%). Citations and Altmetric were weakly correlated ( _r_ = 0.20), with only a 25.0% overlap in terms of articles within their top 10th percentiles. Traditional citations were higher for articles with imaging vs nonimaging content (11.5 ± 16.2 vs 6.9 ± 9.8, _P_ < 0.001), but Altmetric scores were higher in articles with nonimaging content (5.1 ± 11.1 vs 2.8 ± 13.7, _P_ = 0.006).

## Conclusions

Although overall online attention to radiology journal content was low, alternative metrics exhibited unique trends, particularly for nonclinical articles, and may provide a complementary measure of radiology research impact compared to traditional citation counts.

## Introduction

Biomedical investigators seek to make an impact within their area of research . Measuring such impact is important for identifying the most meaningful research within a field, evaluating individual investigators' academic performance, and guiding decisions regarding the awarding of promotions, tenure, and grant funding . However, an optimal method for assessing research impact remains elusive. Historically, the impact of individual research articles has been assessed by simple counts of citations to articles within the subsequent peer-reviewed literature . This approach, however, has been heavily criticized in recent years . First, conventional citations are very slow to accumulate. Months, if not years, are required for later studies referencing the article to be written, to proceed through the peer review and revision process, and then to undergo production and publication. This delay precludes any meaningful evaluation of impact based on citations within short time frames. In addition, conventional citations measure impact among essentially a single audience—that of other scientific investigators—and fail to reflect broader dissemination .

The advent of the Internet, and of social media in particular, has greatly promoted the diffusion of biomedical research among more diverse audiences . Allied health-care practitioners, patients, policy makers, the popular media, and other stakeholder groups may use a range of social media platforms to share and engage in dialog regarding research of their individual and unique greatest interests . The concept of “altmetrics” (referring to nontraditional alternative article-level metrics) was coined in 2010 in reference to new metrics that seek to capture the online “buzz” regarding individual articles as a measure of impact .
