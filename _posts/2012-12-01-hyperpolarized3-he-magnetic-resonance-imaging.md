## Rationale and Objectives

Pulmonary functional imaging using four-dimensional x-ray computed tomographic (4DCT) imaging and hyperpolarized  3 He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides regional lung function estimates in patients with lung cancer in whom pulmonary function measurements are typically dominated by tumor burden. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantitative spatial relationship between 4DCT and hyperpolarized  3 He MRI ventilation maps.

## Materials and Methods

Eleven patients with lung cancer provided written informed consent to 4DCT imaging and MRI performed within 11 ± 14 days. Hyperpolarized  3 He MRI was acquired in breath-hold after inhalation from functional residual capacity of 1 L hyperpolarized  3 He, whereas 4DCT imaging was acquired over a single tidal breath of room air. For hyperpolarized  3 He MRI, the percentage ventilated volume was generated using semiautomated segmentation; for 4DCT imaging, pulmonary function maps were generated using the correspondence between identical tissue elements at inspiratory and expiratory phases to generate percentage ventilated volume.

## Results

After accounting for differences in image acquisition lung volumes (  3 He MRI: 1.9 ± 0.5 L ipsilateral, 2.3 ± 0.7 L contralateral; 4DCT imaging: 1.2 ± 0.3 L ipsilateral, 1.3 ± 0.4 L contralateral), there was no significant difference in percentage ventilated volume between hyperpolarized  3 He MRI (72 ± 11% ipsilateral, 79 ± 12% contralateral) and 4DCT imaging (74 ± 3% ipsilateral, 75 ± 4% contralateral). Spatial correspondence between 4DCT and  3 He MRI ventilation was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient index (ipsilateral, 86 ± 12%; contralateral, 88 ± 12%).

## Conclusions

Despite rather large differences in image acquisition breathing maneuvers, good spatial and significant quantitative agreement was observed for ventilation maps on hyperpolarized  3 He MRI and 4DCT imaging, suggesting that pulmonary regions with good lung function are similar between modalities in this small group of patients with lung cancer.

Thoracic imaging functional measurements and maps have been evaluated for use in lung cancer radiation therapy planning with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) , high-resolution four-dimensional (4D) x-ray computed tomographic (4DCT) imaging , and hyperpolarized noble gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . These studies support the use of regional thoracic functional measurements for lung cancer radiation treatment plans and have resulted in reduced radiation dose to well-functioning lung without dose decreases to the treatment target volume . Lung cancer radiation therapy planning typically relies on anatomic measurements on CT such as gross tumor volume and anatomic location, as well as radiation dose parameters such as the volume fraction of the lung receiving ≥20 Gy and mean lung dose. On the basis of these parameters, the 5-year survival rate for stage III small-cell lung cancer and non-small-cell lung cancer is still very low (<20%) . Thus, there is a critical need to improve lung cancer radiation therapy outcomes, and this is driving research that incorporates functional imaging measurements within therapy planning for lung cancer .

In this regard, the incorporation of SPECT for lung cancer radiation therapy planning has been promising, but there are some inherent limitations that may preclude routine clinical use, mainly related to image artifacts stemming from radiolabeled tracers depositing in the major airways , requiring significant postprocessing to remove and sometimes resulting in distortion of the underlying ventilation signal. Hyperpolarized  3 He MRI provides an alternative to SPECT , but the availability of  3 He is inherently limited, and the global supply is rapidly declining and expensive , limiting the potential for its translation to clinical use. Hyperpolarized  129 Xe MRI is another alternative , but it is less developed than  3 He MRI and is currently in the early stages of clinical research applications . In contrast, thoracic CT is readily available at most clinical centers, and pulmonary function maps can be generated from computed tomographic images acquired during maximum inhalation and exhalation as well as tidal breathing . Preliminary results suggest that 4DCT ventilation volumes correlate well with tidal volumes and with changes in contoured lung volumes between maximum inspiration and expiration images . Furthermore, 4DCT imaging is increasingly being used as a standard of care to evaluate primary tumor motion prior to radiation therapy and therefore would not require additional imaging to incorporate functional images into radiation treatment plans . Although 4DCT imaging appears to be the most practical tool for incorporating lung ventilation maps into the treatment planning regime for lung cancer, before clinical translation can occur, a thorough and comparative evaluation of 4DCT imaging with other imaging methods is required to validate 4DCT functional maps.

. The specific ventilation was inherently coregistered to the maximum exhalation phase computed tomographic image and calculated for all voxels defined by corresponding binary lung parenchyma masks. Image segmentation for the generation of lung masks was previously described and was performed using a global histogram threshold to define the lung parenchyma. Three-dimensional region-growing techniques were used to extract and remove the main-stem bronchi and pulmonary vasculature from the images . We derived 4DCT VV from the 4DCT ventilation images, whereby the 4DCT ventilation map was segmented into five clusters using three-dimensional k-means cluster analysis as described previously for hyperpolarized  3 He MRI segmentation , where cluster 1, representing the lowest ventilation intensity, was defined as ventilation defect and clusters 2 to 5 were defined as ventilated voxels. The maximum exhalation phase computed tomographic images were used to calculate the TCV. Four-dimensional computed tomographic PVV was calculated as the ratio of VV to TCV. The 4DCT ventilation map was reconstructed from the axial (acquisition plane) to the coronal plane. Four-dimensional computed tomographic ventilation map voxels were averaged to match resolution of the  3 He ventilation map.
