## Rationale and Objectives

To suggest a methodical approach for refining transitional management abilities, including empowerment of a growing leader, leading in an unfamiliar organization or leading in an organization that is changing.

## Materials and Methods

Management approaches based on the body of work dealing with leadership studies and transitions and dealing with leadership during times of transition and change management were consolidated and categorized.

## Results

Transitional leaders can benefit from effective leadership training including defining and prospectively accruing necessary experiences and skills; strengthening information gathering skills; effectively self-assessing; valuing and implementing mentoring; formulating strategy; and communicating.

## Conclusions

A categorical approach to transitional leadership may be implemented through a systems-based and methodical approach to gaining the definable, and distinct sets of skills and abilities necessary for transitional leadership success.

## Introduction

Section chiefs and department chairs are often recruited for leadership positions as external candidates. These leaders try to adapt to increased responsibility while trying to understand an unfamiliar organization. Established leaders may also find their own familiar organization changing, either intentionally or unintentionally. These all can be considered examples of transitional leadership.

Section chiefs, such as a neuroradiology section chief, may step into a position requiring strategic direction setting, service schedule formulation and maintenance, professional development of their sectional faculty, and interfacing with non-neuroradiologists where policy and process are concerned. Department chairs will often be responsible for the same responsibilities on an expanded departmental rather than sectional scale, in addition to having greater budgetary and financial responsibilities. New section heads may be challenged by the increased responsibility they face where scheduling and the professional development of others are concerned, typically not having had to bear such responsibilities. In such cases, new section heads may need to learn about new domains of knowledge such as mentoring systems and approaches. New department chairs similarly need to learn about a new and expanded domain of financial management, in addition to assuming responsibility for strategy setting in areas that they may be unfamiliar with. A department chair who is a neuroradiologist still assumes responsibility for the institutional strategy where musculoskeletal imaging is concerned, necessitating effective and expanded delegation. Delegation itself is an essential task for leaders who may have received little formal attention in new leaders' preceding posts.

Tableâ€‰1


When to Act What to Do Before seeking a leadership role Secure leadership training. Gain essential skills and experiences to be competitive. Assess your own abilities to lead. Assemble a panel of mentors. While assessing a leadership opportunity Perform an organizational reconnaissance. Assess the organization's STARS  \\*  state and leadership need. Identify whether you possess the essential skills and disposition to succeed. Soon after assuming a new leadership role Build your own leadership team. Connect with line managers to establish control. Define a strategic intent. Establish major priorities and goals. For long-term security in a new leadership role Establish mentoring systems for the employees. Assure the quality and success of your line managers. Ensure professional development of employees as a top priority.

The table includes individual considerations for a transitional leader, in each of four time spans. One set of considerations is appropriate before seeking a leadership role. A second set is intended for consideration as a leadership opportunity is being assessed. A third set is intended for implementation soon after assuming a new leadership role, and a fourth and final set of tasks is suggested for long-term security.
