## Objectives

To determine the accuracy of ultrasound in early detection of bone erosions and monitoring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a gold standard technique.

## Material and Methods

This prospective study was carried out on 50 patients with known RA and 15 healthy controls. Conventional radiography was standardized and performed in two planes. Ultrasound (US) and MRI was performed to evaluate the presence of synovitis, tenosynovitis, and bursitis as well as erosions on ultrasound and MRI. The results in the study group were compared with those obtained in a control group.

## Result

In the study group, the most frequent US finding of shoulder joint was Tenosynovitis of the long head of the biceps tendon. Tenosynovitis was observed in the long head of biceps tendon in 20 joints (40%). Erosions of the humeroscapular joint were detected by conventional radiography in 15 (30%), by US in 41 (82%), and by MRI in 46 (92%) of the shoulders examined, no statistically significant difference is noted between US and MRI in overall detection of erosion ( _P_ = .333).

## Conclusion

US is a helpful imaging method and in comparison with MRI in assessing the shoulder joint and, preferably with MRI, are recommended as additional techniques in the initial diagnostic evaluation when radiography yields negative results.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to bone and cartilage destruction . Shoulder pain is one of the most common complaints encountered in patients with RA pain in the shoulder may be caused by various intra and extra-articular pathology mechanisms. Clinical findings of the painful shoulder are similar or even equal for cases with different etiology .

Initially, the disease targets the glenohumeral joint and often causes erosions in the greater tuberosity. The acromioclavicular joint and the subacromial bursa may be affected by synovitis and severe cuff thinning is extremely common .
