## Rationale and Objectives

The posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm (PICAA), especially distal PICAA, is easily missed by a doctor, leading to misdiagnosis and treatment delays. The objective of this article is to report the computed tomography angiography (CTA) presentations of 30 cases of PICAA proved by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or surgical operation, and analyze the causes of misdiagnosis of PICAA by CTA.

## Materials and Methods

Thirty cases of patients with PICAA that were proved by DSA or surgical operation were included in this study, all of whom underwent CTA before surgical procedure. The relationship between the locations of PICAA and the rates of missed diagnosis by CTA was analyzed. The detection rates of the PICAA by volume rendering (VR) images and original thin axial images of CTA were compared.

## Results

Twelve cases (12 of 30, 40%) of aneurysm lied on the proximal end of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (border with vertebral artery) and all of them (12 of 12,100%) were clearly displayed on the VR images of CTA and correctly diagnosed by doctors. Eighteen cases (18 of 30, 60%) of aneurysm lied on the distal part of the PICA, whereas only 2 of them (2/18, 11.1%) were displayed on the VR images and correctly diagnosed before surgical procedure. After surgical operation, the respective review of the CTA images demonstrated that all aneurysms (30 of 30, 100%) can be found on the thin axial images after careful observation and are shown on VR images after adjusting the display threshold when the locations of the PICAA through thin axial images were known, including the distal PICAA.

## Conclusions

Thin axial CT images are most important and reliable for the detection of distal PICAA. Overdependence on three-dimensional VR images of CTA is the main cause of misdiagnosis.

## Introduction

Posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm (PICAA) is relatively rare, accounts for about 0.5%–1% of intracranial aneurysm, but it is easy to re-rupture after the acute phase of first-time hemorrhage and causes death. So it is extremely important to determine the existence of PICAA and give surgical treatment as earlier as possible . Although the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is the last and largest branch of vertebral artery, its thin lumen makes it difficult to be shown on volume rendering (VR) images of computed tomography angiography (CTA) under conventional or standard protocols . The posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm (PICAA), especially distal PICAA, is easily missed by a doctor, leading to misdiagnosis and treatment delays. In our routine work, we found that most of the PICAAs were missed on CTA diagnosis and nearly all of the distal PICAAs were missed by CTA. The objective of this article is to report the CTA presentations of PICAA and analyze the causes of misdiagnosis of PICAA by CTA.

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

The study was conducted under the approval of the institutional review board of our hospital. Written consents were obtained from all patients before the study.
