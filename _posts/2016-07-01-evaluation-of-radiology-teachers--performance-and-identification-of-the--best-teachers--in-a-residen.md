## Rationale and Objectives

Radiology teachers are well trained in their specialty; however, when working in academic institutions, faculty development and promotion through the education pathway tends to be based on their teaching knowledge and skills. The aim of this study is to assess psychometric properties of the Medicina Universidad Católica—Radiology 32 items (MEDUC-RX32), an instrument designed to evaluate the performance of postgraduate radiology teachers and to identify the best teachers.

## Materials and Methods

Mixed methodology was used, including qualitative and quantitative phases. The psychometric properties of the MEDUC-RX32 survey were performed by factor analysis (validity), Cronbach alpha coefficient, and G coefficient (reliability). The residents assessed their teachers and simultaneously voted for the “best teacher,” which was used as a gold standard for the receiver operating characteristic curves construction comparing their votes with the global score.

## Results

A total of 28 residents answered 164 surveys. The global score was 6.23 ± 0.8 (scale from 1 to 7). The factor analysis showed six domains of the resident's perception: (1) tutorial teaching, feedback, and independent learning; (2) communication and teamwork; (3) learning objectives; (4) respectful behavior; (5) radiological report; and (6) teaching and care support. The tutor's strengths were related with respectful behavior and teamwork. The instrument is highly reliable with a Cronbach alpha of 0.937 and a G coefficient of 0.831 (with a minimum of 8 residents). The MEDUC-RX32 instrument has a sensitivity of 91.7% and specificity of 83.3% to identify tutors as best teachers with at least one vote with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.931 with a cutoff of 5.94.

## Conclusions

The MEDC-RX32 instrument is a multidimensional, valid, and highly reliable method to evaluate radiology teachers, identifying teachers with excellence in tutorial teaching in a postgraduate radiology program.

## Introduction

Performance assessment of medical teachers constitutes an important tool in medical education. There are several instruments for clinical teacher evaluation, which includes the assessment of skills as curriculum planner, facilitator, and resource developer . The _Maastricht Clinical Teaching Questionnaire_ is considered the most methodologically rigorous questionnaire in terms of its development and psychometric validation, and it is oriented to in-hospital teaching . Other tools include the _Student Evaluation of Teaching in Outpatient Clinics_ , focused on postgraduate ambulatory teaching, the _Stanford Faculty Development Program_ questionnaire , and the _University of Michigan Global Rating Scale_ . There are also two questionnaires developed in our institution: Medicina Universidad Católica—30 items (MEDUC-30) and Medicina Universidad Católica—Postgraduate 14 (MEDUC-PG14) for assessment of undergraduate and postgraduate clinical teachers, respectively .

Despite the quality of work being performed in the setting of faculty evaluation in postgraduate specialties, as far as we know, there is no valid instrument available with this objective in the radiology field. In fact, the attributes related to “best teachers” are not established in radiology education yet. Therefore, a multidisciplinary working group was established to design and test an instrument (Medicina Universidad Católica—Radiology 32 items \[MEDUC-RX32\]) to assess radiology faculty teaching performance in the postgraduate setting .
