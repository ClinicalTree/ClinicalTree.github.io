## Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of a novel total liver volume perfusion computed tomographic technique in demonstrating treatment-site recurrence of liver metastases after radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

## Materials and Methods

Eleven patients considered to be at increased risk for local RFA-site tumor recurrence underwent both positron emission tomography (PET) and perfusion computed tomography (CTP): a 12-phase scan of the entire liver acquired before and 11 times after contrast injection. After coregistration, blood flow maps were created using the maximum slope method.

## Results

In all cases, the CTP-derived blood flow maps fully paralleled the PET images in showing either the absence (nine of 13 lesions) or presence (four of 13 lesions) of local RFA-site recurrence. Marginal lesions with high hepatic arterial perfusion (>50 mL/min/100 g) and low portal venous perfusion (<10 mL/min/100 g) represented recurring vital tumor tissue ( _P_ < .05).

## Conclusion

Total liver volume CTP seems feasible for the detection and localization of treatment-site recurrence after RFA.

Currently, the most widely used tumor ablative technique for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) is radiofrequency ablation (RFA). In patients with unresectable hepatic tumors, RFA has proved to be safe and feasible . Furthermore, there are indications that RFA can improve both short-term and long-term survival . Unfortunately, up to 40% of treated patients have recurring disease, and 12% are found to have recurrence at a treatment site only 1 year after RFA ( ). If recurrence is limited to the treatment site, most often, a second RFA procedure or surgical resection can be performed.

At present, positron emission tomography (PET) is the best follow-up imaging modality for the early detection of recurrence, although PET cannot be used as an image-guiding technique for local ablative therapies such as RFA . However, PET combined with computed tomography (CT) can provide exact localization of active tumor tissue ( ), although this equipment is expensive and as yet not widely available. Using conventional CT, one study showed that of 38 ablated hepatocellular carcinomas that initially showed no enhancement, eight actually did recur. The authors concluded that short-term follow-up CT performed <3 months after treatment is not a reliable method to determine remission . Differentiation between vital tumor tissue and post-RFA necrosis with perilesional inflammation can be difficult if not impossible using CT or ultrasound. We evaluated the feasibility of a technique using total volume perfusion CT (CTP), combining morphologic and dynamic enhancement information from a multiphase computed tomographic scan with hemodynamic blood flow maps, for the detection of local treatment-site recurrence after RFA.

![Figure 1, Multifocal radiofrequency ablation (RFA)–site recurrence 3 months after the ablation of a very large unresectable adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. The conventional four-phase images on computed tomography (CT) depict a large, nonenhancing, strongly hypodense necrotic area (a–d) , representing the post-RFA lesion, with three adjacent areas showing vague hyperdense blushes on the arterial (art) phase image (b) . All three areas (white boxes) are clearly visible on the blood flow (BF) maps as heterogeneous regions of high arterial perfusion (e) and low or absent portal venous (port ven) perfusion (f) . Positron emission tomography (PET) suggests the presence of local RFA-site recurrence in all three areas (g) .](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyDetectionofLocalRFASiteRecurrenceUsingTotalLiverVolumePerfusionCT/0_1s20S107663320900258X.jpg)

![Figure 2, Focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA)–site recurrence 9 months after the ablation of a large colorectal liver metastasis. Arterial (art) (a) and portal venous (port ven) (b) phase images on computed tomography (CT) with typical perilesional slightly increased hepatic artery blood flow (BF) (c) , normal portal venous blood flow (d) , and somewhat increased 2- [ 18 F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose uptake on positron emission tomography (PET) (e) . This rim region probably represents reactive inflammatory tissue and should not be mistaken for tumor recurrence. In the same patient, a few centimeters caudally, a superficial focal spot that is hyperdense during the arterial phase (f) and isodense during the portal venous phase (g) is shown. This spot has a very high hepatic artery blood flow (h) and absent portal venous blood flow (i) , which clearly parallels the PET-positive focus (j) . A core biopsy proved the presence of tumor recurrence.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyDetectionofLocalRFASiteRecurrenceUsingTotalLiverVolumePerfusionCT/1_1s20S107663320900258X.jpg)

![Figure 3, Focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA)–site recurrence 6 months after the ablation of a colorectal liver metastasis. The patient was considered to be at increased risk for local tumor recurrence because of the proximity of the inferior caval vein. A lesion with hyperdensity during the arterial (art) phase (b) and hypodensity during the unenhanced (a) , portal venous (port ven) (c) , and equilibrium (d) phases is visible on the lateral margin of a small avascular post-RFA lesion abutting several hemostasis clips. The blood flow (BF) maps (e,f) and positron emission tomography (PET) (g) clearly show an avid lesion with high arterial and low portal venous flow at the lateral margin of the post-RFA lesion. The lesion clearly shows contrast enhancement on the microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) image (h) . This is suggestive of tumor recurrence, which was confirmed by core biopsy.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyDetectionofLocalRFASiteRecurrenceUsingTotalLiverVolumePerfusionCT/2_1s20S107663320900258X.jpg)

![Figure 4, Focal radiofrequency ablation (RFA)–site recurrence 6 months after the ablation of a large colorectal liver metastasis. Unenhanced, early and late arterial (art), portal venous (port ven), and equilibrium phase images (a–e) show a post-RFA lesion with heterogeneous enhancement at the dorsal margin. The blood flow (BF) maps (f,g) clearly display a marginal lesion with high arterial and low portal venous flow, which parallels a marginal enhancing lesion on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (US) (h) and a somewhat smaller avid lesion on positron emission tomography (PET), acquired 8 weeks earlier (i) . Intraoperative core biopsy confirmed the presence of RFA-site tumor recurrence.](https://storage.googleapis.com/dl.dentistrykey.com/clinical/EarlyDetectionofLocalRFASiteRecurrenceUsingTotalLiverVolumePerfusionCT/3_1s20S107663320900258X.jpg)
