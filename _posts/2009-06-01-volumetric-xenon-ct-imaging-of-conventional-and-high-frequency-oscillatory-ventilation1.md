## Rationale and Objectives

For mechanical ventilation of patients with pulmonary injuries, it has been proposed that high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) offers advantages over conventional ventilation (CV); however, these advantages have been difficult to quantify. We used volumetric, dynamic imaging of Xenon (Xe) washout of the canine lung during both HFOV and CV to compare regional ventilation in the two modalities.

## Materials and Methods

Three anesthetized, mechanically ventilated animals were studied, each at three different ventilator settings. Imaging was performed on an experimental Toshiba 256-slice scanner at 80 kV, 250 mAs, and 0.5-second scans, yielding 12.8 cm of Z-axis coverage. Repeated images were acquired at increasing intervals between 1 and 10 seconds for 90 seconds during HFOV and using retrospective respiratory gating to end-expiration for 60 seconds during CV. Image series were analyzed to quantify regional specific ventilation (s V˙
V

˙
) from the regional density washout time constants.

## Results

High-quality, high-resolution regional ventilation maps were obtained during both CV and HFOV. Overall ventilation decreased at smaller tidal volume, as expected. Regional s V˙
V

˙
was more uniform during HFOV compared to CV, but the underlying distribution of lung aeration was similar.

## Conclusions

High-resolution volumetric ventilation maps of the lung may be obtained with the 256-slice multidetector computed tomographic scanner. There is a marked difference in the distribution of regional ventilation between CV and HFOV, with a significant gravitational ventilation gradient in CV that was not present during HFOV. This technique may be useful in exploring the mechanisms by which HFOV improves gas exchange.

Functional lung imaging with x-ray computed tomography facilitates the study of pulmonary structure–function relationships by providing both detailed anatomic information as well as co-localized physiologic information . As the speed and volumetric coverage of multidetector computed tomographic (CT) scanners has increased over time, so has the ability to rapidly and efficiently characterize variation in regional lung function across the entire lung. Recently, volumetric CT image acquisition took a giant leap with the introduction of the Toshiba Aquilion One scanner, a multidetector CT scanner capable of acquiring 320 contiguous 0.5-mm thick axial slices in a single 0.33-second rotation, making true volumetric CT imaging commercially available. We had an opportunity to test a preproduction 256-slice version of this scanner to evaluate its potential for studying the distribution of pulmonary gas exchange during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), a novel form of mechanical ventilation with application in management of patients with refractory acute lung injury .

For mechanical ventilation of patients with pulmonary injuries, it has been proposed that HFOV offers advantages over conventional ventilation (CV); however, the physiology of HFOV remains poorly characterized . In contrast to CV, which delivers breaths that mimic normal breathing with volumes of 400–900 mL at 6–30 breaths/minute, HFOV delivers breaths of 40–150 mL at 180–900 breaths/minute (3–15 Hz). The rationale behind this approach is that by ventilating with smaller breaths at an elevated mean lung volume, it may be possible to avoid the injurious extremes of lung overdistention and collapse that can arise from the large volume excursions applied to the stiff, injured lung during CV . Because the tidal volume in HFOV is smaller than the anatomic dead space (the volume of the conducting airways leading to the gas-exchanging alveolar region), the methods of gas exchange and, further, the factors governing the distribution of ventilation, are distinctly different from those in CV. It has been difficult to directly measure these differences in intact subjects.
